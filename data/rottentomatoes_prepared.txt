Its content has classic and tragic dimensions beyond politics.	This film has received a lot of praise from critics, but not that many people will find this that entertaining.	Both a how-to manual for guerrilla terrorism and a cautionary tale about how to fight it. It's also quite possibly the finest war film ever made.	The price of invasion has never been more poignantly spelled out than in this classic film.	'The Battle of Algiers' serves potent warning to those who envision warfare, or any Western-dictated settlement, in areas so hungry and so foreign.	A powerful, documentary-like examination of the response to an occupying force, The Battle of Algiers hasn't aged a bit since its release in 1966.
Neither a great night out nor a great night in.	A sanitized Boogie Nights.	I don't get that lifestyle, but I was hoping that 54 would show me why so many people find that appealing. It was not to be.	The new disco era film 54 is Fame on drugs, a low-grade Saturday Night Fever.	An entertaining reminder of how facile the disco era really was...	Poor plot development and slow pacing keep 54 from capturing the energy of it's legendary namesake.
While the story is more oddly archaic than ever, we might find ourselves exiting the movie with the overwhelming desire to kick off our own Sunday shoes.	A lively and rambunctious remake of the 1984 classic about a rebel with a cause who loves to dance.	Not even a rather obvious lack of interest in the adult actors amongst can stop Footloose from finally becoming the film that 1980s nostalgia would have us assume the original is.	There's at least one very compelling reason to see it: Brewer understands how to do music on film better than anyone else working today.	It's as if Brewer is taking a stand for movies that look like movies instead of audience hipness barometers.	While it hews closely to the 1984 original, Craig Brewer infuses his Footloose remake with toe-tapping energy and manages to keep the story fresh for a new generation.
Sex & a very singular man	A beautifully touching true story that never feels like the typical biopic since it finds a way of instilling humor and charm into a delicate and often tragic situation.	A movie about sex that shows a whole lot of sex, but isn't sex-obsessed. The Sessions grabs you in the heart rather than the loins.	Ben Lewin's The Sessions is an emotionally charged film with a smart sense of humor that'll have you tearing up from equal doses of laughter and drama.	O'Brien was the subject of an Oscar-winning short "Breathing Lessons," and it seems likely that "The Sessions" will receive a few nominations of its own. It deserves them.	Tender, funny, and touching, The Sessions provides an acting showcase for its talented stars and proves it's possible for Hollywood to produce a grown-up movie about sex.
Patrice Chereau's portrait of a marriage en crise is an excoriating look at the deep unhappiness that can fester within the most respectable-seeming of households.	Both protagonists give elegant and moving performances.	Most of all, we think, 'Gosh, all of these experiments make for a cold, uninvolving film.'	Based on a short story by Joseph Conrad, here is stylized rendition of a foundering marriage of convenience.	One of the film's savage ironies is that his wife's inevitable betrayal strikes less at his heart than at his all-consuming sense of order.	Patrice Chéreau's exquisite rendering of Joseph Conrad's The Return brings underlying passions to surface in a long-suffering marriage.
I have never been quite sure why this $30 million comedy made by John Landis in 1980 became such a cult.	I am never not amused by the Blues Brothers.	Big, loud, often obnoxious, but surprisingly sweet-tempered.	lightning in a bottle created more than 30 years ago	The story is thin, but there's a consistently wonderful over-the-top mentality.	Too over the top for its own good, but ultimately rescued by the cast's charm, director John Landis' grace, and several soul-stirring musical numbers.
Ghostbusters is primarily a showcase for Murray, who slinks through the movie muttering his lines in his usual cheeky fashion and getting off an occasionally hilarious crack that proves he's thoroughly enjoying himself.	See website for more details.	I had a good giggle watching Ghostbusters again, and I recommend checking it out for an evening of turn-your-brain-off entertainment.	Only intermittently impressive.	There is more attention to special effects than to humor.	An infectiously fun blend of special effects and comedy, with Bill Murray's hilarious deadpan performance leading a cast of great comic turns.
The movie is taut with suspense but culminates in wise resignation as the hero comes to understand he's running from a part of himself.	Boy A is one of those rare movies that takes the idea of rehabilitation seriously. In the end, it may present a worst-case scenario, but it does so with unusual depth and conviction.	Andrew Garfield nailed an assignment many actors would avoid or, worse, botch in "Boy A" - embody a grown, traumatized man experiencing emotional honesty, transparent kindness, sexual intimacy and genuine appreciation from others for the first time.	Lovingly photographed, achingly romantic and memorably acted by Garfield in a breakout role, it's a small movie worthy of a large audience.	Boy A is so excessively mannered that the story's human element (misunderstood youth, society's indifference) is lost.	Small in scale but large in impact, Boy A's career making performances (particularly that by star Andrew Garfield) and carefully crafted characters defy judgment and aggressively provoke debate.
The movie plays every joke down the middle, aiming its dim wit at 5-and-unders, insulting them and whoever was foolish enough to take them on the outing.	The cast shuffles its way through an unending parade of eye-wrenching CGI displays, their collective body language asking the producers for their Part 2 paycheck already.	It's guileless, designed almost to be forgotten, and its modest intentions generate no resentment [in the viewer].	Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is actually a lot closer to the cartoons than the first... movie was, [but] they are really stupid cartoons.	Scooby e Salsicha continuam divertidos, mas, em vez de temerem os monstros que enfrentam, deveriam fugir do medíocre diretor Raja Gosnell.	Only the very young will get the most out of this silly trifle.
What Megamind lacks in apparent laughter it makes up for in sheer cleverness.	Unfortunately, the underdeveloped story and characters seem to be there to service the visuals, rather than the other way around.	Full of fun and eye-popping images, "Megamind" is what they used to call in the old days of television "side-splittingly funny."	"Megamind" is a genial animated sendup of superhero flicks that should appeal to kids around the age when they're getting a bit cynical about do-gooders in capes and tights.	Three dimensions or two, the one-dimensional plot has little appeal.	It regurgitates plot points from earlier animated efforts, and isn't quite as funny as it should be, but a top-shelf voice cast and strong visuals help make Megamind a pleasant, if unspectacular, diversion.
[Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon] both are so aggressive, so creepy and off-putting.	A doggedly eccentric film which some will reject out of hand. Others will find it profundly moving and life affirming.	A classic of dark comedy.	A whimsical love story; Cort is cuddly, Gordon is larger-than-life. An enchanting piece.	This darkly humorous ,romantic comedy between an introvert adolescent and and old spunky woman, is playing it too safe to be considered truly anti-establishment, but it became a cult picture.	Hal Ashby's comedy is too dark and twisted for some, and occasionally oversteps its bounds, but there's no denying the film's warm humor and big heart.
The film is so jubilantly over the top and aware of its own failings, it's hard not to laugh.	It knows what it's doing and it's awesome... Crank relishes in its outrageous stunts... Jason Statham is a one man Die Hard.	An instant cult classic. Pure, hardcore moviemaking backed by an inane plot, unrelenting action and zero pretensions.	For moviegoers who found Running Scared a little too sedate.	So blatantly contrived it could be called The Fast and the Spurious, Crank has the small saving grace of being intentionally ridiculous.	It's a film about a guy injected with Speed... wait, there's no bus. It's a film about a guy who has to kick a bunch of squirmy butt to stay alive... wait, no snakes or planes here. But it is a film about doing lots of drugs and pulling lots of punches, and it entertains accordingly.
[P]imping... Paris Hilton to movie audiences is [the] primary reason for the existence of this crass 'remake'...	The film does everything that teen horror flicks are supposed to do, but Hilton undermines it all by not even trying to act.	Forty-five minutes of stultifying boredom, followed by preposterous carnage pilfered from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.	As slick as it is, House of Wax basically serves up the kind of gory, oozing jolts that will transport some toward a kind of antic release and others towards the nearest exits.	This isn't boring, but is as predictable as can be.	Bearing little resemblance to the 1953 original, House of Wax is a formulaic but better-than-average teen slasher flick.
This one is really for Fraser die-hards only.	There's not one joke, one slapstick moment, one innuendo that's funny.	Though occasionally producing a minor chuckle, Dudley Do-Right is mainly characterized by good artists making bad choices.	I always wondered how the original producer, Jay Ward, could squeeze out a 5 minute segment each week on such a flimsy premise. Now the big question is how some bigwig executive thought they could squeeze out an 80 minute movie on the same idea.	Pacing is slow in this comedy, as if actors are waiting -- along with the weary kids and adults in the audience -- for anyone to say something funny. We're still waiting.	Gags aren't that funny.
Awkward camera angles, editing and pacing of some fight sequences gives a direct-to-video at times. If you're a fan of the last two Underworld movies and are willing to suspend your disbelief and to check your brain at the door for 93 minutes, you'll at l	Feels like a superfluous placeholder until Kate Beckinsale and Len Wiseman are available and ready to make a true third installment in the series.	And this time there aren't even any leather pants.	The numerous action sequences, while imaginative, lack a visual cohesion that allows them to be fully appreciated.	Lacks the Gothic coolness that made the original such an underground hit.	Despite the best efforts of its competent cast, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is an indistinguishable and unnecessary prequel.
The unforced and honest power of the emotion ever so quietly sneaks up on you by film's end.	A breakout performance by Jake Gyllenhaal!	There's hope, heroism, and Dern as a dying schoolmarm, but October Sky falls flat due to its all-too-obvious third act and the vague fact that, really, not that much happens.	October Sky is exactly the sort of Hollywood picture we need to see more often: cleanly written, capably filmed, and focused on a young person who's determined to turn his life in constructive, creative directions.	spirited, exciting entertainment that delivers on any number of levels - and you don't have to be a youngster to enjoy it.	Rich in sweet sincerity, intelligence, and good old-fashioned inspirational drama, October Sky is a coming-of-age story with a heart to match its Hollywood craftsmanship.
Offers a smorgasbord of distinct styles as it compiles an unprecedented movie mix tape of poetic interludes.	After having seen the 18 pieces that made the final cut, I can't help wondering on what grounds the two rejected works were judged unworthy.	The results are uneven, but with each segment focused on a different arrondissement and only about five minutes in length, one does not have to linger in any neighborhood -- good or bad -- for very long before its time to move on.	From comedy to drama, varied anthology is worth the trip.	The bee's knees, the cat's pajamas and the lobster's dinner shirt of movies currently playing.	Paris Je T'aime is uneven, but there are more than enough delightful moments in this omnibus tribute to the City of Lights to tip the scale in its favor.
Bridges inhabits Bad fully, and cleverly uses our decades of fondness for him as an actor to give us a way to connect to his troublesome character.	Jeff Bridges continues to astonish, in this case even making an ordinary movie into something better.	In this country ballad%u2013like movie that's earning Jeff Bridges Oscar buzz, he plays a downward-spiraling musician. Bridges offers a great performance, but his hokey romance with Maggie Gyllenhaal clashes with the film's gritty realism,	Bridges is perfectly attuned to every nuance of the character he plays in Crazy Heart ...	Now that I've seen Jeff Bridges' portrayal of Blake ... I can't imagine another actor occupying the role.	Thanks to a captivating performance from Jeff Bridges, Crazy Heart transcends its overly familiar origins and finds new meaning in an old story.
Carnahan delivers a genre movie that turns in fresh ways without screaming to the audience that it is turning your head...	This is a dark, depressing, excessively violent, profusely profane film, not for the squeamish or anyone who likes elevating entertainment.	The movie fairly bristles -- with degraded-image '70s grit ... handheld hysteria, thickly profane dialogue, abject bloodletting, and post-Method performances.	See this one for acting and atmosphere.	Narc isn't the great movie the gifted Carnahan probably has in him, but it's a great cop B-movie.	Jason Patric and Ray Liotta are electrifying in this gritty, if a little too familiar, cop drama.
A splendid experience: the dialogue, the acting, the depiction of London, the lust, jealousy and intrigue.	Shakespeare himself would probably love it. He did write Twelfth Night, for goodness sake.	Anonymous is earnest, high-camp and regularly ridiculous, but it's also a fun and gripping adventure for lovers of stagecraft or Tudor mystery.	There's absolutely nothing pleasurable about this self-serious and remarkably stupid drama.	It may be one of the signs of the apocalypse, but thanks to a well-written screenplay, spot-on performances, and a fantastic production design, Emmerich has finally made a great film.	Roland Emmerich delivers his trademark visual and emotional bombast, but the more Anonymous stops and tries to convince the audience of its half-baked theory, the less convincing it becomes.
Its flighty quarter-life crisis theme [will be] familiar to anyone who's seen five minutes of Girls.	Frances Ha is endearing, kind and, in many ways, Noah Baumbach's best movie to date.	Blessedly more interested with being funny and relatable than it is with trying to make pretentious statement about generational or societal detachment.	[Frances Ha] may feel tossed-off, but like the early French New Wave films that inspired it, this affectionate portrait of wayward young folks trying to survive, emotionally and professionally, in the big city is both touching and meaningful.	Gerwig superbly incarnates the contradictions of this insecure woman.	Audiences will need to tolerate a certain amount of narrative drift, but thanks to sensitive direction from Noah Baumbach and an endearing performance from Greta Gerwig, Frances Ha makes it easy to forgive.
In a single day, through a single pair of eyes, Trier and Lie give us an emblem for the world.	It's an absolutely moving and devastating film, and one of the most jarring looks at addiction you'll ever see on screen.	Sad, but wise, and clear-eyed about what it means to drift through life until it's suddenly too late to turn back.	An astounding achievement, Joachim Trier's haunting film will stay with you for weeks.	Trier's film takes us to some desperate places, but it earns that despair with clear eyes, and the sense of character is finely-honed...	An upfront study of a drug addict confronting his demons, Oslo, August 31st makes this dark journey worthwhile with fantastic directing and equally fantastic acting.
[A] powerful, mesmerizing thriller, a masterful exercise in controlling an audience`s attention.	One of the most subversive films of the 1980s, delving into the corrupt underside of the then-idealized faux innocence of the 1950s with an almost alarming ferocity.	Blue Velvet is a film for the aficionado. Pity the viewer who wanders into the movie unprepared.	Kinkiness is its salient quality, but Blue Velvet has deadpan humor too, as well as a straight-arrow side that makes its eccentricity all the crazier. There's no mistaking the exhilarating fact that it's one of a kind.	Destined to become a cult classic, Blue Velvet presents what is probably the most original cinematic vision to come along this year. Undoubtedly, it will be too strong for many tastes.	If audiences walk away from this subversive, surreal shocker not fully understanding the story, they might also walk away with a deeper perception of the potential of film storytelling.
Besson's incomparable film is almost impossible to beat and there's yet to be a director who could match his magnum opus...	Luc Besson's original cut feels more like a journey than just a joy-buzzer jolt of action, and the deeper, braver, darker story he set out to tell - a fractured and fractious fairy tale. When people rave about "The Professional," they mean "Léon."	You'll enjoy the action, but you'll remember the movie because of Reno and Portman.	Top-notch thriller.	Besson's skills of action director are enough to guarantee entertainment.	Pivoting on the unusual relationship between seasoned hitman and his 12-year-old apprentice -- a breakout turn by young Natalie Portman -- Luc Besson's Léon is a stylish and oddly affecting thriller.
A documentary about a rich couple riding the waves of wealth and greed and then plunging downwards.	By the end, the movie has pulled off a small miracle: You become absorbed in the lives of these people for who they are and not what they own.	I feel contempt for my contempt for these people. Whether that's my problem or the film's, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm leaning toward blaming Greenfield.	There's more going on here than classist derision, and the filmmaker uses her footage to try to sort out her feelings.	Porn without penetration is sometimes how this doc impacts in its candid, unapologetic look at a once white-bread couple who vault to billionaire status and fall hard when the 2008 financial crisis hits.	The Queen of Versailles is a timely, engaging, and richly drawn portrait of the American Dream improbably composed of equal parts compassion and schadenfreude.
A hideously annoying and emotionally blank tale.	A trite compendium of everything that's wrong with non-Pixar computer-animated feature films.	A thin joke becomes attenuated to breaking point.	Do anal probe gags sound like fine family entertainment? How about multiple scenes depicting ugly gay panic? Not to worry; a penis joke referring to a male member as an 'antenna' is right around the corner.	It's cute, it's passable, the animation is fine--but the major problem with the film is its predictability.	Planet 51 squanders an interesting premise with an overly familiar storyline, stock characters, and humor that alternates between curious and potentially offensive.
It may seem strange to contemplate the possibility that sharks are more victim than vicious. Yet after Stewart makes his case you may find them and their cause, as he does, all-consuming.	Thanks to [t]his sometimes gruesome, sometimes harrowing and often exuberant film, you will never look at sharks the same way again.	the 'reality drama' that unfolds on-screen takes viewers away from the real ecological issue (much as it took Stewart away from his diving)	Stewart, a Toronto-based marine biologist and underwater photographer, makes up for in passion what he lacks in narrative subtlety.	Stewart's point is that the shark fin industry, in its short-sighted quest for financial gain, may trigger an ecological disaster beyond the extinction of the sharks themselves. This is depressing, but important, stuff.	In addition to its breathtaking underwater photography, Sharkwater has a convincing, impassioned argument of how the plight of sharks affects everyone.
A unique, kooky gem.	strives to be offbeat and sometimes works itself into a sweat doing so. The humor often hits the bullseye, however...	Forget Citizen Kane. As a matter of history, this seminal film is unquestionably the finest work of cinema ever made. Required viewing for all students and fans of the art form.	Although the plot is sweet and simple, the laughs are what make this movie stand out.	John Cusack launched his career as a lovable loser at love with this teen comedy about a guy who gets dumped when his girlfriend decides to trade up.	Better Off Dead is an anarchic mix of black humor and surreal comedy, anchored by John Cusack's winsome, charming performance.
Great fun if not quite the great teen pic some believe it to be.	Fast Times has not endured the passage of time.	How could they do this to Jennifer Jason Leigh? How could they put such a fresh and cheerful person into such a scuz-pit of a movie?	[VIDEO ESSAY] "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is a remarkable outlier in the teen movie genre even if tone-deaf critics such as Roger Ebert panned the film upon its released in 1982.	Was never all it was cracked up to be.	While Fast Times at Ridgemont High features Sean Penn's legendary performance, the film endures because it accurately captured the small details of school, work, and teenage life.
The filmmaker makes peace with his difficult youth by accepting that every life is filled with both darkness and light.	Here the legacy of blood flows in both directions, replicating itself in an infinite dance. While the first half focuses on young Alejandro's relationship with macho authoritarian Jaime, the second is as much about the father's own coming of age.	I appreciate the theatricality of Jodorowsky and his imaginative and hallucinatory way of telling his story. He is definitely a man who follows his own path.	Jodorowsky's images can be stunning, and his ability to acknowledge pain without being depressing is a rare gift. The film is a wayward dream but well worth embracing.	A film with an imagination as big as its heart - which is mighty grand, and more powerful than authoritarianism.	This long-overdue return from Alejandro Jodorowsky finds him just as overflowing with imagination -- and heart -- as fans have come to expect.
Director Marcus Nispel continues in Pathfinder the gory/lame tradition he began with his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.	The movie takes us on a journey to an ugly, contentious period in our misty, ancient past -- all the way back to four months ago, when Apocalypto came out.	Pathfinder is simultaneously action-packed and a total bore, a strange movie that never seems to move even though it consists of almost nothing but violence.	Must the 13-year-old boy Hollywood seems most eager to please also be a sadist? First came Apocalypto, then 300, now Pathfinder.	There's a fan's sincere hokeyness about Pathfinder that makes the experience relatively painless, in spite of the number of people who get tortured, decapitated or dismembered.	A few rousing action sequences can't make up for Pathfinder's non-existent plot and silly dialogue.
Pretty much all of Never Back Down is shot like an episode of Punk'd, with a soundtrack from an MTV2 playlist. Which is all perfectly appropriate and kinda fun.	Bloody fight film has heart, but it's no champion.	A formula flick that should have tapped out in the script stage.	Maybe it's just a genre picture, but scene after scene in Never Back Down displays vitality and wit. This is the year's first good-looking and fully enjoyable American movie.	Bruising but brainless teen action-melodrama...like a match that delivers a few good punches but drags on to a dull and predictable end.	Though not without its pleasures, Never Back Down faithfully adheres to every imaginable fight movie cliché.
At the heart of this art is the thrill of the then-new: when Pinocchio hits sea-base and gushes "Gee! What a big place!", we share a sense of joy at the filmmakers' creative adventures.	Nope, no perverted subtext here.	The moral lessons include a literalization of metaphors about lying and other forms of misbehaving, and the grasp of a little boy's emotions and behavior often borders on the uncanny.	Clearly the high-water mark of Disney's animated features; very nearly the high-water mark of American commercial film.	The original Scared Straight!	Ambitious, adventurous, and sometimes frightening, Pinocchio arguably represents the pinnacle of Disney's collected works -- it's beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant.
The band scenes are downright gladiatorial in their visceral impact and energy...edited with the tightness of a snare drum and photographed with the geometrical majesty of a Busby Berkeley musical.	More than compensating for the formula script are Drumline's tuneful glory and driving rhythms, along with a pulsating vitality that never flags.	...enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm, the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games.	Charles Stone III has assembled a diverse and dramatic piece of material that is indebted as much to America's love of sports as it is to America's problems with raising men.	I love that we get into this world of marching bands. We barely see any football players -- we see the top of their helmets as they're getting out of the way.	Essentially a sports movie with drums, the energetic Drumline somehow manages to make the familiar seem fresh.
In 'The Rocket' the children and outcasts triumph because they are innocent enough to believe and act as though the impossible is possible.	The Rocket is a thoroughly infectious yarn set among the jungles of Laos.	The Rocket is a well-constructed delivery system for sparkly cheer, but it lacks a more substantial payload.	Inescapeable hopelessness turns out to be neither	A hugely enjoyable, thoroughly infectious feature debut.	A feel-good success crafted with care, Kim Mordaunt's story of two young kids in Laos is a heartfelt audience pleaser while remaining sensitive toward its subjects.
Thoroughly confounding the 'normal' relationship between abuser and victim, first-time director Slade presents a complex morality tale under the guise of an exploitation thriller.	Hard Candy is supposed to be another cautionary tale about the dangerous risks of online chat-room dating, but ends up being just another psychological horror flick about pedophilia in which Little Red Riding Hood turns the tables on the wolf.	This is one particularly edgy and disturbing little film, and it will no doubt have people talking by the end of the year -- if not for its taboo subject matter, then for the brilliant performance by its Lolitaesque star, Ellen Page.	While I couldn't recommend Hard Candy [rated R] for its easy entertainment value, it is worth seeing for how a relative newcomer like David Slade handles a high tension two hander.	There is no question that Hard Candy is an intense and unnerving little film. But when all is said and done it's a rather empty exercise in hot button pushing.	Disturbing, controversial, but entirely engrossing, Hard Candy is well written with strong lead performances, especially that of newcomer Ellen Page. A movie that stays with the viewer long after leaving the theater.
It is well written, contains a flock of colorful characters, and gives star Mel Gibson a number of great one-liners.	Makes up for its faults with nearly non-stop action and some amusing tongue-in-cheek humor.	Rehashed Quentin Tarantino or a rusted-out Pinto.	Sadly, though, Payback finally puts Gibson at the mercy of a torture and sadism sequence so attenuated and so painful to watch that it sabotages the picture's own quite solid instincts for theater, innovation and wit.	In the popcorn sense, it certainly delivers on mindless escapism. In the artistic sense, let's just say that Payback is a long way from Point Blank.	Sadistic violence and rote humor saddle a predictable action premise.
Much like Errol Morris' "The Fog of War," Dror Moreh's film is a sobering inside look inside history, at mistakes made and opportunities missed.	The Gatekeepers doesn't play like agitprop. The storytelling is strong, the images stark.	The Israeli journalist Dror Moreh has hit a documentarian's trifecta with "The Gatekeepers."	The filmmaker doesn't speculate about why these men are talking, but he leaves you with an excellent guess.	Moreh employs a direct interviewing style, reminiscent of Errol Morris' work, to get the men to talk about their days leading Shin Bet.	Strikingly stark, brutally honest, and rivetingly assembled, The Gatekeepers offers essential perspective on a seemingly intractable war from some of the men who fought it.
Hader and Wiig give rich, nuanced performances that reflect the chemistry the two actors honed together from their years on Saturday Night Live.	It seems unlikely that The Skeleton Twins is aiming for something so simplistic, considering how much suffering it packs into the story, but simplistic is what it is.	Caustically wry and cloyingly sentimental, The Skeleton Twins is a crowdpleaser.	One of the stronger ensemble movies of the year but the drama offers crowd-pleasing tricks and tissue-thin pop psychology.	The bond between siblings is made very real by Wiig and Hader, who make that old line about laughing until you cry genuinely believable.	Led by powerful performances from Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, The Skeleton Twins effectively mines laughs and tears from family drama.
Far from classic but it is interesting to watch for its take on the pre-Disnified New York landscape following the company's real estate foray into the iconic downtown core.	The computer-assisted animation is relatively stiff and inexpressive.	Lacks the classic Disney charm that works for adults as well as kids	This is a funny, enjoyable family treat.	Even as a cartoon poodle, Bette Midler stops the show.	Oliver & Company is a decidedly lesser effort in the Disney canon, with lackluster songs, stiff animation, and a thoroughly predictable plot.
Easygoing satire of mythical determinism	Saturday matinee fun in the finest tradition.	In a cinema landscape populated with all kinds of digitally created creatures and setpieces, it's nice to take a look back and witness the birth of these ideas.	The straight story of Jason's exploits, told with magic and imagination and a minimum of studio trickery, might have been delightful. This version is more bull than Bulfinch.	"Jason and the Argonauts" features some of Harryhausen's most memorable stop-motion creations, including the giant bronze statue Talos and a creepy army of swordfighting skeletons.	Don Chaffey's Jason and the Argonauts is an outlandish, transportive piece of nostalgia whose real star is the masterful stop-motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen.
This unique work does humanise the two directors, but also shows that these two fallible humans are capable of making wonderful if not perfect cinematic works.	A fascinating meditation on filmmaking and a remarkable intellectual exercise.	If this sounds like Jackass for intellectuals, that's because it is, but without the laughs.	It's amusing only if you agree not to think very much about it.	Leth leaves the viewer both exhilarated and maybe even optimistic about the capacity of human intelligence and creativity.	Both an intriguing intellectual exercise and an amusing look at the contrasts between the two filmmakers.
2012 does answer the question of what a filmmaker with no great attachment to logic does when he can't choose between instruments of destruction. The answer: he exploits them all.	An Oscar-caliber cast and dazzling visual effects can't rescue this formulaic disaster flick from a script flooded with generic dialogue and preposterous plot points.	In the proud tradition of Roland Emmerich movies, "2012" is incredible in every sense of the word: totally not credible, and yet hugely entertaining.	This isn't disaster porn, it's a disaster gang-bang.	It's the end of the world as escapism. It's an event movie. It's daft. The visual effects are amazing. See it on a big screen.	Roland Emmerich's 2012 provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.
'Puss in Boots' is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven.	Purr-fect fun for rugrats mourning the end of the Shrek series.	Puss in Boots is certainly not the cat's meow, but it doesn't deserve a place in the litter box either.	Where are Shrek, Fiona andgulpDonkey when you need them?	Every time Puss opened his mouth to speak I was so captivated by his gnashers they helped to make this one of the most entertaining animations I've seen since The Incredibles and Happy Feet.	It isn't deep or groundbreaking, but what it lacks in profundity, Puss in Boots more than makes up for with an abundance of wit, visual sparkle, and effervescent charm.
Such a bland and lifeless experience even the most ardent of Scott Sanders or Michael Jai White fans will do well to not grow bored before the end.	If you revel just a tiny bit in the 'blaxploitation' genre, then Black Dynamite is a sweet stew of shut-yo'-mouth that'll keep you loaded with glee for its apt 90 minutes.	Before an hour has passed tedium overtakes Black Dynamite -- one corny martial-arts sequence turns out to be plenty -- and all the good jokes dry up.	Here, the acting, framing, focus, blocking, editing, sound and film processing all nail down the period so perfectly... It looks, sounds and feels as if it were shot in 1972.	As Dynamite kung-fu-fights his way through a vast conspiracy involving smack-addled orphans, malt liquor, and the best (read: worst) exploding-car scene of 2009, you'll feel a rush of '70s nostalgia you never knew you had.	A loving and meticulous send-up of 1970s blaxsploitation movies, Black Dynamite is funny enough for the frat house and clever enough for film buffs.
A Western-tinged adventure whose innovations are so scant that the only things keeping the enterprise afloat are clumsy references to its predecessors.	Milla Jovovich does a female chauvinist dressed-to-kill biker babe, while dodging cannibalistic crows. Rarely has mass murder been so dull. Pass the smelling salts.	The franchise is becoming almost as mindless as the zombies it portrays, lumbeirng on with only repetitive instinct, while all true vitality has long since passed away.	One or two good action sequences keep boredom at bay for a while, but so little of it is fresh that extinction can't come too soon.	Those zombies are back on the march in the third instalment of the horror-action series that plays like a rip-off of George A Romero's Day Of The Dead, only with a much lower IQ.	Resident Evil: Extinction is more of the same; its few impressive action sequences unable to compensate for the pedestrian plot.
The Rock reveals his classy transition from WWE star to a charming and charismatic big-screen action hero.	The Rock proves he can kick [butt] with clothes on.	Mildly entertaining action movie with The Rock.	With surprising presence and quiet confidence, The Rock has cooked up a winner.	Connoisseurs of Christopher Walken, and there are some hard-core addicts lurking about, will have good reason to take in The Rundown -- they can add a few more riches to their treasure chest of Wonky Walken Moments.	The Rundown doesn't break any new ground, but it's a smart, funny buddy action picture with terrific comic chemistry between Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Seann William Scott.
In plot, it meanders. In character development, it implodes. In action, it plods. In effect, it numbs, but, alas, not quickly enough.	Director Paul McGuigan serves this up with a flashy swagger but there is no disguising the fact that it is an incomprehensible mess.	One of the better recent attempts at cashing in on the superhero film craze without having an actual comic book to adapt.	It's the kind of film you wish had no sound - perhaps the studio should have eliminated the dialogue and replaced it cue cards every few minutes like the silent films of old.	Push is this year's Jumper. 'Nuff said.	The sci-fi thriller Push is visually flashy but hyperkinetic and convoluted.
A pleasant and worthy addition to a strong series of films.	Lovingly crafted.	A charming film, infused and emotionally heightened by the imagination of memory.	A pleasure to behold.	With well-written characters and a humorous script, the entire cast shines.	A moving film with moments of humor, Liberty Heights succeeds in capturing the feel of the '50s with great performances and sensitive direction.
The comedy in the film works very well. The romance isn't quite as convincing, but good acting and romantic chemistry prevail.	In contrast to the horrifically stupid, dull romantic comedies the past month or two have brought us, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is almost, but not quite, a breath of fresh air.	It goes on too long and is trapped by too many cliches.	Mutual deception as a comedic conceit predates Shakespeare, and it certainly shows its age in this creaker.	This film sticks like high heels in gravel coming out of the gate. But after the necessary unpleasantness are over the bulk of the film is actually quite entertaining, funny and, well, cute.	Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson are charming together, but they can't overcome How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' silly premise and predictable script.
No matter how hard the film tries to challenge bourgeois notions of wedded bliss, it's all so very civilized.	Brice manages admirably to make his comedy at once daring and earnest, outlandish and relatable, obscene and sweet.	There's an insidious cleverness to "The Overnight" that keeps the audience just a bit off balance.	"The Overnight" is not, by any means, for everyone, what with its adult themes and sexual scenarios, but it's clever and well-acted, and even a bit insightful, which is more than most big movies can say.	Even as sex comedies go, this one is slight, but it's funny.	Witty and unpredictable, The Overnight benefits from writer-director Patrick Brice's sure-handed touch and strong performances from a talented cast.
A touching and haunting film that is more uplifting than its central theme suggests, Time To Leave leaves us with much to reflect upon, and consider.	A cinematic tone poem, wafting on wistful tableaus and sad faces....mostly elaborates on how death must ultimately be a personal experience.	Romain sees his inner child wherever he goes. The problem is, that childishness is all we really understand about the character. Nothing else punches through.	...surprisingly unengaging [and] utterly devoid of humor.	Another year, another minimal but solid offering from François Ozon	A reflective look at our own mortality through the experience of a middle-aged French man, Time To Leave manages to pull at our heart strings without resorting to cliches, and leaves a lasting impression.
Powerful, angry and bizarre documentary.	Your Mommy Kills Animals will more than likely still draw you in with its unbiased approach -- and, no matter where you stand on the issue of animals, you will definitely learn a lot about people.	While avoiding the most important travesty--the use of animals for food--the documentary does efficiently illustrate the arguments for an against the use of animals for research and fur.	What may be the finest documentary of the year also is the most difficult to watch. I wept unashamedly at the brief videos of real-life animal abuse in "Your Mommy Kills Animals," and you may, too.	It's the best kind of documentary, in that if you're a thinking person it is nearly impossible to watch the movie without having your point of view challenged and questioned.	A thoroughly fascinating, well-presented examination of the animal rights debate that is both provocative and thought-provoking.
I wish Dwayne Johnson well, and I respect Disney's tenacity when it comes to their dreadful formulas, so I look forward to next year's offering: 50 Cent in the Cub Scout comedy, Da Top Scout.	A Disney comedy that tries to overcompensate with cute what it lacks in clever.	As comedies go, The Game Plan is srictly by the playbook, but Johnson is game for anything, and he does a fine job of entertaining the child in all of us.	Having tamed one muscled man-child (Vin Diesel in The Pacifier), Disney sets its sights on The Rock.	A barf-inducer. A hurl-promoter. A projectile-vomit-stimulator.	Despite The Rock's abundant charisma, The Game Plan is just another run-of-the-mill Disney comedy.
Jackie Brown isn't a great film, but it has the air of its director's wicked brilliance.	It's slow, it's sad and it's very funny in ways that don't really revolve around punchlines. It's about characters who have been around the block one too many times and they're exhausted, full of dreams deferred, just trying to scrape by.	Um filme divertido que se ressente do choque entre os personagens criados por Elmore Leonard e os concebidos por Tarantino.	The movie takes 150 minutes to tell what should have been a 90-minute story.	When you absolutely, positively got to thrill every mother****er in the room, accept no substitutes. Jackie Brown is the AK-47 in Tarantino's arsenal.	Tarantino's third film, fashioned as a comeback vehicle for star Pam Grier, offers typical wit and charm -- and is typically overstuffed.
There's material to discover about the Gypsies in this laudable attempt, but the film is long, repetitious, and not selectively enough edited.	The characters are as lively as their music and I enjoyed riding along with them.	The camera work is always note-perfect.	The poverty contrasts sharply with the excitement of the tour bus and cuts to the heart of the songs themselves, famed for their "joy and sorrow".	The music is unfailingly joyous (even at its saddest), and the film's devotion to outreach and understanding is just as exhilarating.	A dynamic doc following five Romani bands is a pleasure for the senses thanks to vibrant colors and eclectic music.
The real show-stopper remains Judith Anderson's formidable turn as Mrs. Danvers.	Both a tender gothic romance and a haunting ghost story.	Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood film is a sumptuous and suspenseful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's romantic novel.	Excellent, but may be too long and moody for kids.	Hitchcock shows superb technical control and attends to his trademark motifs, from monstrous mother figures to the fetishisation of clothing.	Hitchcock's first American film (and his only Best Picture winner), Rebecca is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.
If "Leviathan" showed us the primal terror of everyday life, this new film is a warm hug, a salute to our shared humanity.	As a theatrical experience, Manakamana is spellbinding. But it's a complex spell ...	If you're prone to carsickness, this might not be the ideal movie for you. But as a meditation on the way human beings fill the silence - or choose not to - it's an amazing accomplishment.	As a cross-section examination of Nepalese society it's fascinating, but like any other film of this kind, the eleven sequences that make up Manakamana's 117-minute runtime vary in interest.	The directors, Pacho Velez (who did the camera work) and Stephanie Spray (who recorded the sound), condense world history into the confined space of a glassed-in bubble.	Its tranquil pace will prove jarring for the blockbuster-inclined, but Manakamana rewards patient viewers with a singularly haunting experience.
It's Mel Brooks at his campy best.	It shows artistic growth and a more sure-handed control of the material by a director who once seemed willing to do literally anything for a laugh. It's more confident and less breathless.	Bug-eyed Marty Feldman steals the show as Igor, pronounced 'Eye-gor'.	...the comedy here is refreshingly restrained. Sure, it's silly, but there's little call for bathroom humour, excessive violence or other staples of more recent comedies.	Say this for Brooks - he saw women as comedic equals, and they continually proved him right.	Made with obvious affection for the original, Young Frankenstein is a riotously silly spoof featuring a fantastic performance by Gene Wilder.
It's all too convenient, but has eclat and two appealing stars.	Thelma and Louise meets a tame version of Baise-Moi.	There's a core of anger running throughout Chaos, particularly in the steely performances by its two female leads, that gives this satisfying feminist revenge drama/satire its soul.	At once a brilliant strike for feminism and a condemnation of a backwards culture, this controversial thriller is darkly amusing and disturbing cinema.	The talented cast keeps Chaos (Cesar-nominated for Best Film) absorbing throughout its different directions.	Anything but chaotic, Chaos makes a high-energy and award-worthy stab at bourgeois apathy and racial tensions in France, while musing on chance.
The reality of 'unscripted' programming et al. trumps the critique from the gitgo.	A real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage factory.	Contrived, didactic and packed with mindless violence.	15 Minutes should have been played as a dark comedy -- instead it wallows in it's own self-indulgent muck.	The filmmaker tries to eat his cake and have it as well, giving his audience ample servings of what we presumably want while slapping our wrists for it at the same time.	As critical as it is about sensationalism in the media, 15 Minutes itself indulges in lurid violence, and its satire is too heavy-handed to be effective.
Scarcely satisfies, yet it lingers -- limpidity of image along with imperceptible epiphanies	Impressively reduces Murakami's hard-boiled word world to a floating-picture world. But like Lish's edits of Ray Carver, it mutes a story that was nearly mute to begin with.	It creates a mood that sweeps over you, that kind of movie works better on the big screen. On the small screen, it doesn't have the oomph to demand your attention.	Tony Takitani is an exquisite film, as elegant and precise as an impeccably cut diamond.	Light on plot but heavy on mood, this Japanese import layers voice-over, fluid photography and a melancholy piano score to create a hypnotic poem about isolation and loss.	Despite its deceptive wispiness, this delicately lovely and melancholy film about loneliness has a haunting power.
This is the creepiest, most authentic feeling, smartest horror flick in a long time.	It's altogether devilishly cunning.	A superbly realized take on the perils of being different in a world that demands conformity.	On its surface, Ginger Snaps is a werewolf movie, but what's refreshing is the clever satire at its core.	This is not just another monster movie. Ginger Snaps succeeds exactly because it is not 'just' anything.	The strong female cast and biting satire of teenage life makes Ginger Snaps far more memorable than your average werewolf movie -- or teen flick.
Think My Best Friend's Wedding, subtract gay best friend, dorky karaoke scene, charm, and any hint of malice or conflict, and you've got it.	A sweet love story hampered by contrived conflicts.	Another elaborately nut-filled but unsatisfying confection.	Anyone who's read one romance novel knows how this will end, so the only suspense remaining is whose butt will be more fetishized by movie's end.	Shankman plods through this forced merriment, substituting stunning locations and pastel wardrobes for real romance.	Instead of being light and charming, this romantic comedy is heavy-handed and contrived in its execution. Also, it's too unoriginal.
a fascinating action-adventure with uneven and unsure tendencies for politcal comment	The early portions... especially the scenes of little boys being brainwashed and bullied by their RUF captors, are harrowing... Unfortunately, the story's power diminishes as the film goes on.	Never quite overcomes its mindless blockbuster mentality.	A 'King Solomon's Mines' for the troubled consciences of a post-colonial age. (Is that why the lead African character is named Solomon?)	On the one hand, no one with a conscience should buy a diamond unless he or she knows where it came from. On the other hand, should Zwick really be using a glorified action movie to scold us?	Blood Diamond overcomes poor storytelling with its biting commentary and fine performances.
Wild Tales aims to entertain and send its audience home with an artificial relief that will rub off on even the most cynical of human souls. Why resist it?	Each story unfolds concisely, establishing the characters and situation, building up the tensions and some laughter along the way. In such a short screen time, we barely know these characters but we relate to them.	Szifrón gives us a window onto other people's worst impulses rather than a mirror reflecting our own; the laughs come fast and full, and they come a little too easily.	Along the way, Szifrón probes some interesting modern philosophical questions.	A clever collection of short films that coalesce around a central theme, wielding humor and horror in equal measure.	Wickedly hilarious and delightfully deranged, Wild Tales is a subversive satire that doubles as a uniformly entertaining anthology film.
Mindless, harmless popcorn flick. Emphasis on the mindless.	This is a very interesting film and is also successful as a headlong roller-coaster ride of a pure action film.	Ugly, stupid, loud, offensive, and pointlessly violent.	The fierce and unrelenting pace, accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek strain of humor in the roughhouse screenplay, keeps the film moving like a juggernaut.	Minor Verhoeven, well-above-average Schwarzenegger, and as well-made as any action movie from around the turn of the 1990s you could name.	Under Paul Verhoeven's frenetic direction, Total Recall is a fast-paced rush of violence, gore, and humor that never slacks.
like spending your holiday with relatives from hell	Hate Christmas and laughing? This is the film for you.	This isn't a wonderful life: It looks pretty hellish.	I feel more like the Grinch with each passing holiday film...	No mнnimo, uns 30 minutos poderiam ter ficado no chгo da sala de ediзгo. Ou uns 60. Aliбs, para ser mais exato, 98 minutos. Esta seria a ъnica forma de salvar este projeto.	A mirthless movie as fresh as last year's fruit cake, Christmas with the Kranks is a coarse, garish comedy that promotes conformity.
A winning and well-acted portrait of America's entry into the Space Age that is awesome, funny, surreal and right on the mark in its depiction of the country's insatiable hunger for new frontiers.	Along with Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America it's the last great American epic -- the kind of film that couldn't be made today.	Clumsy without being mediocre.	One of the scattered handful of truly great American movies in the first half of the 1980s.	A great movie that unfortunately failed to attract audiences back in '83, this adaptation of Tom Wolfe's book about astronauts pays tribute to what we would like to believe represents the American spirit: hard work, perseverance, camaraderie and vision.	The Right Stuff packs a lot of movie into its hefty running time, spinning a colorful, fact-based story out of consistently engaging characters in the midst of epochal events.
The cop/ crime stuff that makes up the bulk of the movie is well thought out and well directed.	As with his other works, [Mann] binds sound, music and pictures into one hypnotic triaxial cable and plugs it right into your brain. He makes this almost-three-hour experience practically glide by.	As notable as the cinematography is De Niro's performance, which helps you remember why he became a legend in the first place.	With De Niro and Pacino in excellent form, Mann's Heat ignites the screen.	Powerful and compelling drama about two similiar men on the opposite sides of the law find themselves on a collision course.	Though Al Pacino and Robert De Niro share but a handful of screen minutes together, Heat is an engrossing crime drama that draws compelling performances from its stars -- and confirms Michael Mann's mastery of the genre.
Easily joins the ranks of ... throw-away superhero movies made for a quick buck.	Rarely in Hollywood have so many labored so hard with so much time and such financial resources to fill a movie screen with as vast an array of spiritual gibberish, literary poppycock and pure flummery as Mark Steven Johnson's Ghost Rider.	Cage has to collect Satan's unpaid debts, meaning that he becomes a demon biker with a flaming skull for a head - and that's about it for this one-note film.	Grand, empty gestures and loads of CGI effects can't cover up pure schlock. Even the character's iconically cool trademarks -- a flaming skull and a fiery chopper -- are reduced to Velveeta slices. No, damn you, sir.	An unholy mess.	Ghost Rider is a sour mix of morose, glum histrionics amidst jokey puns and hammy dialogue.
It's this emphasis on the animals' fates and ordeals, however, that renders this stunningly photographed film a specious work of zoological observation.	An absolute must-see for fans of roar footage.	Astounding wildlife footage is given a kid-friendly narrative hook, but never overly cuddlified, in Keith Scholey's African Cats.	No doubt, life is tough in the wild but, this being a Disney flick, it's loving too and even comes with a kiddie-friendly narrative that's easy to summarize and hard to dispute.	The animals have names; call it anthropomorphism if you like, but the cat families and their gripping adventures are all the more real to child viewers for that bit of familiarity.	It isn't quite as majestic as its subjects, but African Cats boasts enough astounding footage -- and a big enough heart -- to keep things entertaining.
Dark City is a truly scary flick.	Proyas has, perhaps unconsciously, created an allegory of his own industry, a manufacturer of banal dreams, emotional clichés, hackneyed artifacts, and high-tech hoo-hah designed to conceal the vacancy within and without.	Overall, I must say that this film is one that I thoroughly enjoyed from frame one to frame last, and look very forward to watching it over and over again, with nachos by my side, and mind set to 'absorb.'	While the concept of memory altering is mind-boggling, the visuals bring it chillingly alive.	A surprisingly haunting confection.	Stylishly gloomy, Dark City offers a polarizing whirl of arresting visuals and noirish action.
Redline mostly feels like one long stunt intercut with the boring parts of a porn movie.	Your typical brain dead racing flick...	While the production was clearly expensive, and there is a splash of dazzle in the glossy visuals, the project stands as a monument to waste and extravagance.	Redline isn't exactly a car wreck, mainly because it's far less exciting and you can, in fact, look away.	An idiotic action thriller, vanity project and testosterone-filled guilty pleasure whose sole purpose is to show off a fleet of million-dollar Ferraris and Lamborghinis belonging to fledgling movie mogul Daniel Sadek.	Redline has plenty of bad acting, laughable dialogue, and luxury cars.
If Shimizu's aging idea of rage-made wraiths were true, caterwauling critics would be crawling all over the multiplex right about now.	If you have your unholy and unstoppable spirits crawling out of photo developing solution to chill the crowd, maybe this series should've quit while it was ahead.	The horrific child with huge eyes and the pale waif with a curtain of black hair continue to torment the innocent by appearing unpleasantly under desks and in reflections.	Please let's pull the plug on this insanely over-promoted, over-rated horror brand.	All movies like The Grudge 2 leave us with is a sense of bored futility.	A diminished sequel that makes even less sense than The Grudge 1.
Inspired by the reputed experiences of the film's producer, Middle Men casts its protagonist in a suspiciously flattering light... Fortunately Wilson brings enough dark and disreputable shades to the character for the film to work.	A squandered opportunity to tell what may have been an interesting story.	Zealously nasty fun which, surprisingly, ends on something of a note of upbeat grace and familial redemption...	Pretty much proffers everything you can want in a film based on the upstart company that brought porn to a computer screen near you.	What could have been a complex portrait of a flawed man dealing with the perils of success ends up far less interesting.	Middle Men benefits from a solid cast, particularly Luke Wilson, but its muddled script lets them down.
You just have to appreciate its creative angle toward Peter Pan and his world.	Here we get the uncanny suspicion that Hook was written and directed according to the famous recipe of the country preacher who told the folks what he was going to tell them, told them, and then told them what he had told them.	In the end, Hook isn't great or terrible, but it's both - a film that has some wonderful moments, and some really awful ones	Hook breaks the cardinal rule of J.M. Barrie's timeless fantasy -- it grows up.	Who wants to spend over two hours with a Peter Pan who screams, 'Don't mess with me, I'm a lawyer!'	The look of Hook is lively indeed but Steven Spielberg directs on autopilot here, giving in too quickly to his sentimental, syrupy qualities.
Anyone who has ever dreamed of a Santa who knows your heart's desire should feel a little tug at the heart when Santa's own dreams come true.	Veers between naughty and nice, which puts a lot of pressure on the finale's ability to send us home happy. The good news is that the old fellow doesn't let us down in the end.	A movie conscious, at every waking moment, of trying to out-do its predecessor.	There's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups.	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute, it's full of throwaway one-liners, not-quite jokes, and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies.	Though it's harmless as family entertainment and has moments of charm, The Santa Clause 2 is also predictable and forgettable.
[A] slyly complex and broadly comic farce about innocence, corruption, and the gray areas between.	Cedar Rapids is shaggy and goofy and smart and quirky in all the best ways.	A breath of early spring in the winter movie graveyard.	Like the location of Iowa in regard to the rest of the country, the film ends up right in the middle. Not enough of this, not enough of that. However, it is Helms' daffy sweetness that redeems the whole.	There's definitely plenty to laugh about in Cedar Rapids, there just isn't too much to applaud about.	It's as conventional as its Midwestern setting, but Cedar Rapids boasts a terrific cast and a script that deftly blends R-rated raunch and endearing sweetness.
Sixty Six may find a niche audience, but instead of depicting a boy's first steps toward manhood -- ceremony aside -- it turns into an uninvolving portrait of self-absorption.	...the sort of Jewish film that the whole family can enjoy without feeling they're fulfilling an obligation to see it.	It's labeled a 'true-ish story', and the results are cheeky fun.	Director Paul Weiland ("Made of Honor") co-wrote the tone-deaf screenplay for this cinematic abortion that features the ever-lousy Stephen Rea adding his specific brand of stench to a pasted-together movie that is predictable and boring as it is depressin	...so unrelenting on the misery it piles upon poor Bernie Reubens you may just feel guilty laughing...	Likable but overly sentimental, Sixty Six has snatches of sharp dialogue but is ultimately too predicable.
Bridesmaids features some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments...	Kristin Wiig is sharp-yet-sweet in this shockingly scatological comedy, filled with bawdy, uninhibited babes.	It's uneven, unwieldy and overlong, but if it's yucks you're after you'll find them in abundance in a side-splitting comedy that lifts the veil on every wedding's unsung heroines.	It's an overly contrived jumble, trying out too many comic ideas that eventually swamp the central subject of what a modern young woman expects regarding friendship, courtship and marriage.	As the star and co-writer of Bridesmaids Kristen Wiig finally gets to display her full range and the results are brilliant.	A marriage of genuine characters, gross out gags, and pathos, Bridesmaids is a female-driven comedy that refuses to be boxed in as Kristen Wiig emerges as a real star.
The "star-studded" cast seems to have been selected according to their Premiere power ranking and/or desperation for exposure.	Cliche ridden, predictable, filled with characters so inane that you marvel they made it to adulthood -- and dull, dull, dull.	People often do stupid things for love. That doesn't mean it's worth making a movie about these acts of folly.	Everyone pitches in, but it isn't enough to rescue a tedious, fragmented, scattershot script.	Though there are bright moments -- and it's probably a good Valentine's Day date movie -- the lack of real originality and astringency is regrettable.	Despite the best efforts of a talented cast, He's Just Not That Into You devotes too little time to each of its protagonists, thus reducing them to stereotypes.
Jasmine may no longer be a trophy wife, but she remains a sort of trophy: Something on display, cold and golden, for us to admire.	Much as I love the performances here, the film just generally leaves a sour taste.	Allen's screenplay and Blanchett's performance turn a character that begins as a caricature of social elitism into a vivid portrait of misery...	Blanche Dubois wanted magic. Jasmine French settles for a beach house in the Hamptons.	Jasmine's ride is not nearly as dramatic as Blanche DuBois' emotional deconstruction in Streetcar, but her journey is made tolerable by an Oscar-worthy performance by Cate Blanchett.	Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine finds the director in peak late-period form -- and benefiting from a superb cast led by Cate Blanchett.
A fractured, funny production transported rather reluctantly from the stage to the screen.	Some of the slower tunes tend to grind but the sort of musical/ retro irony is still amusing in places. Not if you don't like dentists though.	It's the professionalism that I admire.	Comic book creepiness, jazzy tunes, and fab cast.	The film represents a rare example where Hollywood has applied itself rigorously to material that might somehow seem beneath it with wholly satisfying results.	Remixing Roger Corman's B-movie by way of the Off-Broadway musical, Little Shop of Horrors offers camp, horror and catchy tunes in equal measure -- plus some inspired cameos by the likes of Steve Martin and Bill Murray.
The film is held together by the raw intensity of Damian Lewis' portrait of the emotional torment of a man whose life is falling apart.	Lodge Kerrigan is a director worth watching, and Keane is a small wonder in a season of big but deadly, brainless blockbusters.	The movie isn't a crowd-pleaser, but it moves the soul, and that's enough.	It's not fun, but it's as much an antidote to fake Hollywood nonsense as anything you'll see this year.	Only Kerrigan's previous Clean, Shaven surpasses Keane as a sympathetic study of a man unravelled.	The scrutinizing camera angles of Keane might at first feel too close for comfort, but this powerful portrait of a man distraught by the abduction of his child plumbs the depths of mental illness and the corners of fleabag hotels in an intimate and touching examination of the seedier side of life.
A film that invests hard science with impassioned moral drive.	Al Gore brings his campaign to reverse global warming to the big screen in this vivid and vital activist movie.	The ultimate effect of An Inconvenient Truth is not unlike looking down the barrel of a loaded gun.	This stunning documentary about global warming is a well-reasoned, clearly-proven, intelligent, cogent, irresistible torrent of scientific data, in a curiously warm, engaging, often funny presentation.	Controversy isn't always a bad thing, and Mr. Freeze's surprising warmth ignites a worthy discussion.	While global warming is a hotly-debated subject, what everyone on both sides can agree upon is that, if real, it's a very bad thing. Since losing the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush, former Vice President Al Gore has busied himself by being an outspoken figure against this potential environmental disaster. As much about the man as about greenhouse gases, this candid, powerful and informative documentary illuminates some of the myths surrounding both of its subjects equally well.
This edgy little bit of nastiness is a good reason to start getting excited about British movies all over again.	Audiences will walk out of the theater shocked to find that only 70 minutes have gone by.	A challenging and intriguing piece of work.	Uses a fragmented storyline, but it doesn't really serve to advance the plot or increase the suspense. In this case, it seems to be just a directorial trick	Unlike some other flicks that have had this sort of labyrinthine structure, Nolan's made sure that everything works...	Super brief but efficient, Following represents director Christopher Nolan's burgeoning talent in tight filmmaking and hard-edge noir.
A film that celebrates the importance of inspiration, albeit in slightly affected fashion.	Williams keeps a stiff upper lip, showing a more sedate and sensitive side, and the Oscar-winning screenplay provides a strong backbone.	Beautifully directed and with an Oscar-winning story.	Dead Poets Society adds little to the genre that hasn't been said before and aims, instead, at familiar stereotypes and overly obvious tugs at the heartstrings.	Solid, smart entertainment.	Affecting performances from the young cast and a genuinely inspirational turn from Robin Williams grant Peter Weir's prep school drama top honors.
As with many good film, it's the destination, not the outcome, that matters, and 'Tim's Vermeer' has the spacious room to allow one to get lost in one man's impressively herculean busy work.	Even when Jenison's process becomes a little tedious, the movie makes sure to remind us that tedium is often an essential part of how art is created.	Speculative documentary might explain Vermeer's technique, if not his eye	An original and endearing documentary from Penn & Teller asks the question: How did he do that?	The beauty of the picture is its tale of obsession by a man determined to convince himself his theory is true.	Entertaining and profound in equal measure, Tim's Vermeer uses its seemingly esoteric subject to pose fascinating questions about art and obsession.
...the film boasts a preaching-to-the-converted vibe that effectively holds newcomers at arm's length throughout.	At best, they're an all-Davy Jones Monkees with varsity soccer co-captain good looks.	If the boys are dreamy and smooth enough for that pink iPod on the ride home from school, that doesn't mean they have the juice to carry a 76 minute documentary. And at 76 minutes, the movie is still too long.	The brothers are no Beatles, but it won't matter to fans who'll just be happy to spend some concentrated time with their crushes.	The Jonas Brothers are a contemporary phenomenon -- a boyish trio who dazzle fangirl tweens.	Jonas Brothers: The 3-D Concert Experience should please the brothers' adoring followers, but for non-converts, this concert film is largely flat and unenlightening.
Penetrating but tedious close-up of a marriage breakup.	There's nothing feel-good about Blue Valentine that the feel-bad parts can't undermine. Which doesn't sound like praise but it is.	Blue Valentine does the impossible, and captures the uncapturable: to watch this film is to watch two people fall in, and eventually out of, love. Few films have ever done it so well.	Wretched and beautiful, devastating and passionate, Blue Valentine evokes every inch of its title's dichotomy.	It's very sad but it's so beautiful.	This emotionally gripping examination of a marriage on the rocks isn't always easy to watch, but Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling give performances of unusual depth and power.
There's something in Rugrats in Paris for all ages.	Predictable and not terribly clever.	Nerve-grinding.	More chic and movie-savvy than its predecessor.	There are also nice themes about bravery, honesty and trust, the animation is astonishingly good, and the constant mayhem makes the very obvious plot bearable.	When the Rugrats go to Paris, the result is Nickelodeon-style fun. The plot is effectively character-driven, and features catchy songs and great celebrity voice-acting.
This is a bizarre and intriguing tale but Bernie remains essentially unknowable and the picture lacks big laughs.	Throughout, there's a tension of real life and fiction, and a pervading sense that fiction has little chance of matching the real thing.	Linklater uses dollops of black humor to provide an edge to this morally ambiguous piece.	Propelled by a perfectly cast trio of stars whose eccentricities shine in singular character roles, Bernie is charmer.	an offbeat black comedy that stays true to the story's bizarre tendency to make you both smile and grimace	Richard Linklater's Bernie is a gently told and unexpectedly amusing true-crime comedy that benefits from an impressive performance by Jack Black.
Howard Hawks only produced this classic scary sci-fi feature, but it has his signature touches all over it: overlapping dialogue, smooth storytelling, compressed time and space.	This is one of the better science-fiction cheapie films...	[In the growing] cycle of films dealing with interplanetary travel, communications or warfare, each succeeding entry endeavors to outpass its predecessors in drawing on fantasy and the imagination. It follows, then, that this is by far the most fanciful.	Even though the thing doesn't begin to make its presence felt till near the halfway point... the simple act of watching men discuss strategy ends up being terrifically absorbing.	The overall message of The Thing emerges as distinctly hawkish. Reactionary or not, though, it's still a masterpiece.	As flying saucer movies go, The Thing From Another World is better than most, thanks to well-drawn characters and concise, tense plotting.
What makes it a wonderful film is that for those of us inside this crazy dream factory, and we're only on the edges, it depicts the relentless nature of the beast, the roller-coaster ride, the unstoppable nature of a film in production.	It's a very intelligent film this, and one I think which is not just revealing about film-making but has insights into the dilemmas of many others who see the businesses -- or indeed family farms -- they have built up over a lifetime going under.	Inception celebrates the manufactured reality, Father of My Children the true one.	Hansen-Lřve's film is about coping, its focus practical and utterly unsentimental, its energy somehow both busy and serene.	Beautiful, profound and, given the gathering tensions of its story, phenomenally full of life.	A tragedy gracefully lifted by tender empathy and moments of joy, Father of My Children is a quiet triumph for writer-director Mia Hansen-Love.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, the latest in the Tom Cruise-starring franchise, sets its hooks quickly and hurtles you forward.	This movie is pure summer entertainment and, when that iconic theme song starts cranking, it's hard to keep yourself from getting sucked right along into it.	Observe the vertical splendour of Cruise's gait: nobody in Tinseltown can run quite like Tom, for whom executive producing a long-running, retro espionage TV show proved a very healthy investment.	I've seen five Mission: Impossible movies now and I don't know a lick about Ethan Hunt except that every couple years he flings his body all over the place, then eventually saves the day.	You can discuss the incongruities on the drive home; while the movie's playing, you're having too much fun getting manhandled by experts.	Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation continues the franchise's thrilling resurgence -- and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal.
"Body of War" is so simple-minded and ham-handed in its case against the war that it ends up diluting its own argument.	When is a startling and devastating war movie made in the past too long ago to shed light on the present? Well, apparently never, if we're talking permanent war characterizing the endless US invasions and occupations around the world.	A tough, affecting documentary about an American soldier in the Iraq war.	Equal parts sadness and inspiration, fury and compassion, the film is sure to divide audiences along ideological lines. But there's no denying the reality of Tomas Young's experiences. A man who has paid so much is more than entitled to his opinions.	A chance to witness the struggles of a remarkable young man. Young may be paralyzed in the body, but his mind is fiercely alive.	Unapologetically political, this intimate and heart wrenching profile of an Iraq veteran may be rough around the edges but takes a potent stance with determination and compassion.
Director Joe Johnston has fun with the myth of Captain America.	Captain America is not high art, but it is so unabashedly fun -- and such well-made fun -- that it is hard to not like and admire it for so steadfastly being what it is.	Fitfully entertaining, especially the first half, plus a pretty decent villain in Red Skull played by Hugo Weaving, wearing an impressive/scary crimson get-up that looked like it was done through makeup rather than CGI.	Taps into the idea that deep down we all want to dress up and play hero.	...the right kind of patriotic (the kind that doesn't demean other cultures) and the right shade of nostalgia...	With plenty of pulpy action, a pleasantly retro vibe, and a handful of fine performances, Captain America is solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment.
It's horrifying (and R-rated) if not utterly relentless; it sucks your breath away, perhaps too much.	A movie to slit your wrist to.	Disjointed, uneven, unfocused, and hazy!	Comes off as manufactured and synthetic as most Hollywood product.	A profoundly depressing--but riveting--tale!	Aimless storytelling undermines the gripping, unsettling subject of this film.
Future historians of the financial crisis may point to this movie, not Oliver Stone's Wall Street sequel, as the cultural low point of the business world.	In order to enjoy this film, you must: 1. Enjoy other fantasy-based movies such as 'Ghost,' 2. Be open-minded about the afterlife, and 3. Be entertained by beautiful landscapes.	Maybe it will inspire some people struggling at home to break through their fears and live some life. It's also about where dreamy broody guys come from, because Zac Efron really sells Charlie's sketchy behavior, but man is he still dreamy.	If sunlight dappling off the Atlantic and the earnest faces of pure young lovers, plus a dash of unthreatening feel-good spirituality, is all you need to feel sated, then by all means, dive right in.	It's easy to appreciate what Charlie is trying to accomplish, but it does it in such a cloyingly manipulative manner that it's impossible to get on board with it.	Zac Efron gives it his all, but Charlie St. Cloud is too shallow and cloying to offer much more than eye candy for his fans.
The new length gives a clearer view of the civil war context: a nightmare of panic as the south flees before the Union's advance.	Leone created a phenomenal film but also created some of the most memorable shots in film history. The extreme close-ups are still impressive to this day.	...while the film is seriously overlong, there are enough elements here to hold the interest of even the most impatient viewer.	An extravagantly plotted epic propelled by waves of free-flowing emotion and a palpable love for the American past	This is a great movie, whatever strange estuary of the western river it occupies.	Arguably the greatest of the spaghetti westerns, this epic features a compelling story, memorable performances, breathtaking landscapes, and a haunting score.
Brown Sugar boasts plenty of good, non-sappy romance, plus laugh out loud comedy.	A romantic comedy, yes, but one with characters who think and talk about their goals, and are working on hard decisions.	It has so many tropes that a teenager could construct a plot line just by connecting the dots.	It's an amiable enough movie, a romantic-comedy with a great soundtrack and an idea or two in its head.	Hip-hop romantic comedy is predictable -- and remarkably charming.	Though predictable and possibly too sweet, Brown Sugar is charming, well-acted, and smarter than typical rom-com fare.
Soppy and girlish in the extreme, this should keep even the tiniest viewer rapt, while all too many adults may fall victim to an inexplicable bout of eye-watering long before the closing credits.	The film uses studio resources to create an entrancing world both in New York and in the heroine's fantasies about India.	The 1939 Shirley Temple version of this book came closer to capturing Sara's vitality.	A Little Princess is a delightful film. Bring your children, or just bring yourself.	From the exquisite costumes to the remarkable set design to the superb performances, this fairy tale comes to life in a way that makes you despair at its ending. But though end it must, its spirit of imagination and its magic of abiding love lingers on.	Alfonso Cuarón adapts Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel with a keen sense of magic realism, vividly recreating the world of childhood as seen through the characters.
Do we even care about these characters enough to worry about their machinations?	Welcome back my friends to the con that never ends ... Duplicity simply doesn't know when to quit.	A cinematic lark that's leaden where it should be light ... suffers from lukewarm chemistry between Roberts and Owen.	Duplicity is a light and airy affair that has far too much fun with zingy one-liners to be concerned with the rather relevant dirty laundry that's being aired out.	Once Gilroy has the film on track with all passengers aboard and accounted for, you do start wondering if he can keep up the momentum. He does -- although so much contrivance is involved that he often runs the risk of leaving you behind.	Duplicity is well-crafted, smart, and often funny, but it's mostly more cerebral than visceral and features far too many plot twists.
First-time director Barrymore has a sharp eye for the rough-and-tumble grunginess of roller derby, and a warmhearted appreciation of the girl power that fuels it.	What Whip It does make clear is that all girls are expected to perform, whether expectations are embodied by parents or audiences.	Drew Barrymore's directorial debut is an absolute delight, with fast paced action, hilarious comedy and outstanding performances from the majority female cast.	Surprisingly touching moments of realisation and emotional connection manage to rise above the dramatic cliches that pepper the rest of the film and account for the best scenes in Whip It. Next to all the punch-ups on the track, that is.	An easy movie to like.	While made from overly familiar ingredients, Drew Barrymore's directorial debut has enough charm, energy, and good-natured humor to transcend its many cliches.
ALMOST a good movie. Of course, that close call with competence is averted with an ending that gets worse and worse as it drags on and on	The camera leers at 10-year-old Fanning to the brink of criminality.	The mystery is maintained only through characters' behaving against their own interest, doing things they wouldn't do, failing to mention things they certainly would mention.	This movie has so little to hide that you'll figure out whodunit long before the credits roll.	Seek ends with a whimper and not a bang, but at least it finally ends; sadly, this turns out to be the highlight of the experience.	Robert De Niro and especially Dakota Fanning have earned some praise for their work in Hide and Seek, but critics have called the rest of the film derivative, illogical and somewhat silly.
Why bother with horror films when you can see this?	...can be draining for those, like myself, who get enough of these people already in our daily lives	JESUS CAMP should be seen as it demonstrates the extremes to which the Religious Right will go to push its agenda.	By gilding the lily so shamelessly, Ewing and Grady guarantee they'll preach only to the converted.	Ewing and Grady have created a terrific catalyst for religious and political discourse.	Evangelical indoctrination is given an unflinching, even-handed look in this utterly worthwhile documentary.
The historic first Trek movie entirely divorced from the original cast is no blot on the franchise.	It does a good job of serving up elements that will please the fans of the show, but it does not quite stand on its own as a memorable motion picture event.	It's a great movie, and a great story.	It has the melodrama of other episodes of the films but fewer absurdities this time around.	First Contact is often great fun and is never less than watchable; it will positively delight legions of Trek fans.	While fans of the series will surely appreciate it, First Contact is exciting, engaging, and visually appealing enough to entertain Star Trek novices.
There is a plot to this enjoyably erratic comedy... But basically it's a framework on which the writers, two of whom (Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney) are Animal House alumni, can hang vulgar, obvious, yet often amusing gags.	Director Harold Ramis doesn't help matters through his lethargic staging of several major slapstick sequences.	A slapstick comedy featuring a host of great clowns.	a gross-out gem, one of the ultimate 1980s flicks	A pleasantly loose-limbed sort of movie with some comic moments, most of them belonging to Mr. Dangerfield.	Though unabashedly crude and juvenile, Caddyshack nevertheless scores with its classic slapstick, unforgettable characters, and endlessly quotable dialogue.
Hovers somewhere between a realistic take on love and the vision of romance sold by drugstore novels.	Eytan Fox and screenwriter Itay Segal have made this a truly universal story about a man who finds the courage to pursue the possibility of love again after heartbreak and loss.	Predictable if measured uplift aside, Fox keeps "Yossi" effortlessly affecting, graced with deadpan humor and a knowingness about lonely lives.	Knoller's superbly underplayed performance ensures that Yossi's sad-sack tendencies aren't allowed to alienate him from our affections.	The film keeps its focus small, but the trouble is, the characters' emotions stay that way, too.	Smart, moving, and deeply empathetic, Yossi is a thoughtful examination of love and grief.
Witty Hitchcock thriller. Not for little ones.	This isn't one of Hitchcock's deeper films, but it's certainly one of his most entertaining.	One of Hitchcock's very best comic thrillers, North by Northwest features scene after unforgettable scene.	See it again and you'll come away marvelling.	At times it seems Hitchcock is kidding his own penchant for the bizarre, but this sardonic attitude is so deftly handled it only enhances the thrills.	Gripping, suspenseful, and visually iconic, this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow.
Places a huge burden on [Aaron] Johnson, who has to play an icon in his pre-icon days while holding down the center of a family drama about a boy with abandonment issues.	Nowhere Boy gets John's teen years in Liverpool exactly right, and first-time director Sam Taylor-Wood has made an excellent choice in casting Aaron Johnson.	Anchored by a strong central turn, Nowhere Boy crafts entertaining, small-scale drama out of Lennon's huge-sized legend. It just lacks the spark and ambition of its subject.	At about a 95 minute run time, Nowhere Boy feels far longer and this is not a good thing.	The real subjects -- and strengths -- in this narrowly focused biopic are the two women who, more than any one else, were responsible for molding the future star's psyche.	Don't expect any musical insights, but this look at John Lennon's early life benefits from its restrained, low-key approach and some fine acting from Aaron Johnson.
This sharply written script is far more cute than I'd expected, but still a lot of fun.	Stylish Hollywood entertainment, albeit unworthy of its near-mythical status.	iconic, American experience, a classic adventure tale, and a singular slice of late-'60s moviemaking that has never really been repeated	It's still fun, but was it ever a great film?	A classic in every sense of the word. Expert moviemaking.	With its iconic pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, jaunty screenplay and Burt Bacharach score, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has gone down as among the defining moments in late-'60s American cinema.
Thankfully, while Date Night has more than it's fair share of flaws, Carell and Fey's chemistry, charm and wit elevate the film into something positively watchable.	Fey and Carell both show why they are so highly regarded, bringing pitch-perfect comedic timing to their parts as they bounce material off each other like it's the most natural thing in the world.	Date Night is held together by a terrific cast that make a little go a long, long way. Somewhere in all of this there was a seriously good movie. As it is, we have a seriously weird one.	The key to Date Night is to leave your brain at the door. You'll be amply rewarded for it, though it won't give you much to talk about on a date.	Somehow, in an act of sheer alchemy, this silly, preposterous, absurd story has been turned into one of the funniest movies I've seen in many months.	An uneasy blend of action and comedy, Date Night doesn't quite live up to the talents of its two leads, but Steve Carell and Tina Fey still manage to shine through most of the movie's flaws.
The filmmakers have made a combustion of a movie, pushing the sub genre of Mexican drug wars to thrilling new limits	This is a meticulously slick, brawny, and set-piece-packed film that provides Blunt with a ripe stage to wow us with her physical and visceral strength once again.	The narrative, like the morality, is murky and muddled, though knowing why one character is embarking on one mission won't make anything clearer	One of the best films of 2015, "Sicario" does more than just lift the dirty, clandestine rug on the Mexican drug war. It poses harrowing moral questions many of us are too nervous to be asked let alone prepared to actually answer.	Denis Villeneuve's Sicario is a slick, simplistic view of the War on Drugs propelled by great perfs from Blunt, Del Toro and Brolin and balletic violent set pieces. I wanted "Traffic," I got movie crack.	Led by outstanding work from Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro, Sicario is a taut, tightly wound thriller with much more on its mind than attention-getting set pieces.
Intelligently written, beautifully photographed, intensely emotional and creatively challenging, it's simultaneously heartbreaking and life-affirming.	A torturously slow meditation on the tribulations of immigrant farmers that strains for an elegiac tone.	Sweet Land is so beautiful that it appears to be made of moving postcards, and so dull that it appears to be made of . . . moving postcards.	If the Christmas movie season sometimes seems like a holiday smorgasbord stuffed with empty calories, Sweet Land is a much-needed palate cleanser.	Sweet Land values interconnectedness -- in a couple, among a community, with the land, and with ancestors -- and powerfully illustrates it within the story's emotional and visual content.	Finding the right balance between subtle and sentimental, Sweet Land moves beyond other similarly-themed dramas with evocative cinematography that plays an equal role to the talented cast.
As tasty as butter	I neither gained any knowledge nor experienced pleasure or deep emotion of any sort; the best that can be said is that I wasn't bored or offended.	click for full review	I don't remember when I've seen a movie with as many exceptional female performances as those in 'The Dead Girl.'	A stern account of how the brutal murder of a young woman affects an array of far-flung characters.	This dark thriller boasts a fresh approach, but it can still get bogged down by its heavy subject matter.
As 85-minute testosterone binges go, you could do a whole lot worse.	Nifty action flick influenced by Hong Kong cinema that includes a critique of French racism against immigrant community.	A die-hard, kinetically charged action film with the kind of shocks and starts that feel truly earned: for once, here's something you might not have seen before, and with no strings attached.	I was delighted by the balletic and acrobatic stunts, some of which evoke Tarzan.	It is more entertaining than any of the 'Spider-Man' flicks, makes the X-Men series boring, by comparison, and is more credible than any of the fantasy-driven offerings from the Far East.	A nonstop thrill ride, District B13's dizzying action sequences more than make up for any expository flaws.
... a sequel that, for once, doesn't coddle its target audience ... Lawrence's quick-draw archer is, if anything, more intense and single-minded, all glowering charisma.	Catching Fire delivers on the grim, roiling promises of the original.	Now the violence is not merely physical, but existential. Far from having won her freedom as promised, Katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative-supporter of the Capitol, lover of Peeta-from which she may never escape.	With its troubling subject matter, Catching Fire makes for a tough balancing act, but Francis Lawrence pulls it off. It's a frequently exciting film, with Hunger Games contestants old and new facing a succession of frightening challenges.	This movie makes you believe in revolution.	Smart, smoothly directed, and enriched with a deeper exploration of the franchise's thought-provoking themes, Catching Fire proves a thoroughly compelling second installment in the Hunger Games series.
Michael Patrick King throws Carrie Bradshaw & Co. under the intellectual bus, making them do monumentally stupid things to satisfy the plot's demands.	Glamour porn with fashion that looks like Lady Gaga at a Wal-Mart shopping spree and a plot that at times is cinematic roadkill. Nonetheless, these are still likable and entertaining characters. The movie did its job and because of that, I enjoyed it.	I lost count of the number of times the filmmakers dropped the word "sparkle" into the script; no doubt they thought they were going for gold, but they've created a load of Ratners.	Amounts to little more than a two-and-a-half-hour plotless fashion show.	The last gasp of a franchise that has definitively lost touch with its roots.	Straining under a thin plot stretched to its limit by a bloated running time, Sex and the City 2 adds an unfortunate coda to the long-running HBO series.
Soderbergh finds the perfect equilibrium between mainstream entertainment and arty panache, lacing this heist movie/romantic comedy with character-motivated time shifting, prominent freeze-frames, a funky soundtrack and an all-around hip vibe.	Faintly melancholy and alluringly fatalistic, this mercurial romance passing as a crime thriller is slyly entertaining and darkly sexy.	George Clooney's transition from telly to movie star was confirmed by this sparky adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel.	A darkly amusing and sly romantic comedy about an accident-prone bank robber (George Clooney) who falls in love with the sexy federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) on his tail.	This zany screen adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel perfectly catches its funky portrait of idiosyncratic characters dealing with the craziness of human desire.	Steven Soderbergh's intelligently crafted adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel is witty, sexy, suprisingly entertaining, and a star-making turn for George Clooney.
White God is an ambitious and thrilling, if a little uneven, canine-centric drama.	White God isn't for everyone. But it is an unflinching, extraordinary piece of film-making.	A rousing creature-feature thriller and political allegory, from Hungarian director Kornel Mundrucz.	Call the shelter; this one's a keeper.	Engrossing, and open to any number of metaphorical readings -- but not for people who can't handle simulated animal abuse in movies.	White God isn't an easy watch, but its soaring ambition and powerful acting -- human and canine alike -- make it well worth the effort.
A lively caper film with snappy dialogue and interesting characters.	Essentially a genre piece overdecorated with phrases, quirks and narrative slipknots with a mannered look-at-me cleverness.	The story is like a bad mountain road: full of twists, turns, and huge potholes, with Mamet driving through it about ten miles an hour, his direction too slack and lackadaisical to build much tension or suspense.	It's one of Mamet's best. It's also one of Hackman's best, most mercurial performances.	David Mamet's films regurgitate every clever quip he's collected on bar napkins throughout the years.	Heist didn't cover any new ground, but the cast and Mamet's expertise with witty banter make it worthwhile.
If some of the connections stretch credulity, an exquisite ensemble cast ... inhabit their characters with a subtle authenticity.	One of the best.	A perceptive, powerfully acted psychodrama.	Well-realized characterizations are undermined by the strained and artificial developments of the plot.	Lantana is Ray Lawrence's Aussie rendition of Short Cuts, a multi-character relationship saga disguised as a bubbling thriller.	Lantana is an intricately plotted character study that quietly shines with authenticity.
Compassionate, suspenseful drama, posing an intriguing ethical dilemma...	Less is more. That's what the Dardenne brothers are all about.	By the end of "Two Days, One Night" we've not only met an unusual heroine and her dynamic husband, but feel like we've gotten to know a small French town whose denizens offer various shadings of a simple moral issue with complex ramifications.	Ms. Cotillard's performance is as fine a piece of screen acting as you will ever see.	Yes, "Two Days, One Night" is a story about courage, and resilience and victory. But it also suggests that sometimes the best victory one can wish for is the ability to keep fighting, one day longer.	Another profoundly affecting work from the Dardenne brothers, Two Days, One Night delivers its timely message with honesty and clear-eyed compassion.
Vertigo stands as one of the thrill master's most psychologically dense and twisted works in which obsession, commitment, and dual identities all merge to create a voluptuous tale of thwarted love.	Bernard Herrmann's eloquent score is among his finest, Stewart is excellent, as always, and Kim Novak is surprisingly effective in her role, another of Hitchcock's icy blondes.	It tests our patience, but then rewards it, not only with beauty and terror, but also with an emotional sucker punch that has yet to be equaled.	The most-discussed work of the master; despairingly sardonic and demanding of multiple viewings.	From a craft standpoint, Vertigo represents the director in peak form.	An unpredictable scary thriller that doubles as a mournful meditation on love, loss, and human comfort.
What makes The Dog so compelling isn't Wojtowicz's cinematic imprint but the place in history that was very likely denied him by chance and his own irascibility.	The true story behind Dog Day Afternoon is fascinating fodder for a documentary, but The Dog squanders this by letting its sociopath subject run the show.	Directors Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren fill "The Dog" with terrific archival footage that captures the feel, look and sound of a bygone, character-filled era.	Dubious fame, but without shame	Try as you may, however, you can't turn away from this obscure footnote in pop culture history, even at his most aggravating. It's that twisted thing we call celebrity.	Fascinating, evocative, and as unconventional as its subject, The Dog offers a colorful window into the real-life story behind a classic film.
Amusing documentary duel at the video arcade.	A terrifically entertaining documentary about an unlikely subject.	Improbably compelling... it's every bit the rousing crowd-pleaser I wanted Rocky Balboa to be.	Benefits immeasurably from a cast of colorful supporting players, as well as a taut narrative that builds to a surprisingly tense climax.	A classic video-arcade game becomes the means of an epic struggle in this funny, surprisingly poignant video documentary.	The King of Kong is funny and compelling with more than a few poignant insights into human behavior. Director Seth Gordon presents the dueling King Kong players in all their obsessive complexity and with perfectly al dente observations.
A feature so eager for statues it practically provides a pen and a reading light to help with any potential award ballot situation that might arise after watching it.	Berry has proven she's willing to take on enormous challenges, and she certainly exceeds her grasp here. Perhaps that's why Frankie & Alice plays more like an elaborate acting workshop than a movie.	Halle Berry impresses in both the title roles of Frankie & Alice, a well crafted if slightly soapy seventies period piece about a young woman's struggle with multiple personality disorder.	Dusted off a full five years after it finished filming, [Frankie & Alice] is now a strange, wounded beast that cries out for Academy validation with every histrionic frame, yet has already missed its window of opportunity.	This movie, with its flashbacks to past sins and traumas, rests squarely on Berry, a mesmerizer who makes every moment count.	Halle Berry gives it her all (and then some), but Frankie & Alice is ultimately too narratively strained and clumsily assembled to do her performance justice.
It is full of the delightful merriment of childhood, albeit dinosaur childhood not Homo sapiens. For a sweet and simple little picture the whole family can gather round the tube and watch with delight, this one delivers the goods.	The Land Before Time is as handsome and honest an animated feature as any produced since Walt Disney`s death; it may even be the best.	A very good animated film, but nothe where near intriguing enough to inspire copious sequels.	Sharp animation and powerful visualisation of scale will enthrall a young audience but the clumsy cub-scout moralising feels, well, extinct.	There is nothing about either the story or its execution to place "The Land Before Time" alongside the classics, but then again, the age of animated masterpieces may be forever past.	Beautifully animated and genuinely endearing, The Land Before Time is sure to please dino-obsessed tykes, even if it's a little too cutesy for older viewers.
Chuck & Buck might be the most perversely agreeable stalker picture ever made.	White and Arteta's remarkable achievement lies in making Buck and Chuck equally comprehensible.	Chuck & Buck is ... sad, funny, true and resonant.	The climactic confrontation between the two men near the film's end ... simply doesn't ring true.	One of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year.	Poignant, unsettling.
Disney's latest animated film is, if not exactly a return to form, a return to the spirit of The Lion King.	These beasts are beautiful, but "Brother Bear" is no "Beauty and the Beast."	Quite easily the best traditionally animated Walt Disney film since 1994's, The Lion King.	Thanks to the reincarnation of SCTV stalwarts The McKenzie Brothers as a pair of moose, Disney's latest animated feature is more like Brother Beer.	Oh, brother, what a bore...	Brother Bear is gentle and pleasant if unremarkable Disney fare, with so-so animation and generic plotting.
Apted possesses the unsettling ability to shape perceptions of their lives and personalities from inside an editing suite, a fact that the members of his flock begin to recognize at varying points throughout their adult years.	A completely unique and remarkable documentary project.	Self-contained enough for theatrical auds new to the series, it will play best with those who've come to care for these Brits over time.	We are all older now, and this series proves it in a most deeply moving way.	An intimate portrait of settling down and finally making peace with one's well-publicized past.	Director Michael Apted continues to utilize cinema as a window into the lives of everyday people, and in the reflection of this documentary we can glimpse our own aging humanity.
Apparently all fat people are inherently evil.	Usually, it takes six or so months for an actor to parlay a Best Supporting Actor nomination into a cringe-worthy career-derailing performance in an unbelievably awful picture.	[Rasputia is] violent, vulgar, selfish, and lacking the subtlety of even a fairy tale orge or evil stepmother. The character undercuts the entire film.	Here's a new Oscar category: The Worst Movie Ever Released by Someone Currently Under Consideration for an Academy Award. The winner? Norbit.	Three Eddie Murphys is three too many.	Coming off his Oscar-nominated performance in Dreamgirls, the talented-but-inconsistent Eddie Murphy plays three roles in Norbit, a cruel, crass, stereotype-filled comedy that's more depressing than funny.
Fitful and flighty, it's a frenetic diversion destined for a popular niche on the dvd shelf.	This sequel's greatest claim to fame lies in turning its innocuously painless original into an overblown bore.	This is what you call a wholesome kiddie movie on drugs.	Smithsonian whips itself into a kind of frenzied exhilaration that's both fun and funny.	Atrociously dumb.	Night at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian is busy enough to keep the kids interested but the slapstick goes overboard and the special effects (however well executed) throw the production into mania.
Looking for comfort food in a movie season stuffed with supposed gourmet fare? Sometimes a good old-fashioned sub will do nicely.	The limits of incredulity are stretched thin, and in the end, though Black Sea is at times an admirable, even memorable film, it could have used a lot more of the sad realism with which it opened.	The journey begins with high hopes and a sense of adventure but very soon it is the disintegration of the relationships on-board that prompts the fiery unraveling; forcing life and death decisions, rather than those concerning wealth and poverty	[You] could do far worse than this competently steered, claustrophobic adventure. But better fare exists in the subgenre catalog, and implausibility problems make this movie only partially compelling.	After the criminally underappreciated How I Live Now, Kevin Macdonald kicks back with a terrific submarine thriller marinated in Eau de MacLean.	Black Sea may not be particularly deep, but thanks to Kevin Macdonald's judicious direction and a magnetic performance from Jude Law, it remains an efficiently well-crafted thriller.
At least he makes his priorities clear; it's not called "Make a Good Movie or Die Tryin'."	Get Rich or Die Tryin' can't be accused of not trying, but neither is anybody apt to leave it feeling all that enriched.	Rambling, boring and full of bad messages for our youth.	Total propaganda... It's the male equivalent of the hooker with the heart of gold.	Sheridan comes up with more than his share of superbly directed scenes, but the whole thing is a mixed bag.	While it may be based upon 50 Cent's own life experiences, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' is too similar to many other rags-to-riches stories to resonate.
A pleasant little diversion.	Though it's never dull, this Mansfield Park has too much of its own agenda and too little of Austen's to completely succeed.	Ms. Rozema has made a film whose satiric bite is sharper than that of the usual high-toned romantic costume drama.	The beauty of this lavish and gorgeous production isn't in the costumes or the buildings, it is in the acting and the script.	Romantic, thoughtful and beautifully filmed.	Solid performances, bold direction.
Dirty Wars leaves some deeper questions unexplored, mainly the philosophical struggle between security and secrecy, but makes up grandly with raw data and one correspondent's passion.	My biggest problem with this movie is the choice to make Scahill the star of the show instead of the basic, disturbing facts.	A tense, shocking US documentary that plays out like an episode of The Wire, though in this case it's not a war on drugs that's being fought (and lost), but the war on terror.	Dirty Wars is essential viewing for all Americans, conservatives and liberals alike. It's intense and depressing. It'll make you angry.	[A] gripping investigative doc, which plays out like a classic conspiracy thriller as it follows a trail of clues to the heart of darkness.	Some viewers may find fault with director Rick Rowley's filmmaking methods, but they aren't distracting enough to keep Dirty Wars from serving as a terribly compelling argument against elements of American foreign policy.
As we learn how to look at the Kunsthistorisches' masterpieces, we're also learning how to watch this movie. ... And better: we're learning how to look at our lives.	It's a hybrid drama/art-history essay about how looking at art recasts our experience of looking at the world.	A powerfully contemplative look at the transformative ability of all art.	Whether you find the result tedious or enlightening will be a factor of your openness to the director's languidly atmospheric approach.	Cohen's vivid eye for forlorn urban spaces makes this as geographically evocative as his other work, but it's a film of clearly etched themes, too, about the solace of growing old as well as the slight sadness of unlived lives.	Its languid pace may frustrate some viewers, but for patient filmgoers, Museum Hours offers a carefully observed portrait of the human condition.
Godard's avoidance of conventional science fiction architecture, in favour of what was actually available within Paris 1965, is his way of commenting on the city, what it was doing to its inhabitants, and what they were in danger of becoming.	Nothing about this strange, moving work of agit-pop has ever seemed out of date. If anything, "Alphaville" moves closer to relevance with every passing year.	Although this is drastically different compared to the rest of Godard's oeuvre, it has without a doubt had a lasting impact with its ground-breaking visuals.	The self-conscious didacticism of 'Alphaville' sinks its ship.	One of [Godard's] most entertaining movies is also one of his most timeless.	While Alphaville is by no means a conventional sci-fi film, Jean-Luc Godard creates a witty, noir-ish future all his own.
[Bullock] knows one of the secrets of doing romantic comedy: treating the romance as a good joke.	It's a long and frustrating wait, but While You Were Sleeping delivers all you can ask of a romantic comedy: the deluxe payoff.	Surprisingly half-decent high-concept chick-flick material.	As cute and cuddly a bedtime story as anyone could wish for.	Romantic, sweet without being cloying, and light on its feet.	While You Were Sleeping is built wholly from familiar ingredients, but assembled with such skill -- and with such a charming performance from Sandra Bullock -- that it gives formula a good name.
Pleasant but slight.	More compelling when focusing on long-serving staff and their skills and opinions.	For all the seductive imagery of billowing apparel and impossibly angled high heels, Tcheng never loses sight of the people overseeing every stitch.	Access to an institution like the house of Dior is a rare and precious thing, and Mr. Tcheng has paid for it with a flattering portrait dressed up to look like cleareyed scrutiny.	Simons is a fascinating central figure, even if the straightforward approach seems determined not to ruffle any feathers.	Dior and I will obviously appeal to fashion fans, but this beautifully tailored documentary may draw in even the least sartorially inclined.
Director Frank Pavich's entertaining documentary makes the case for this overblown epic as a legendary lost masterpiece.	Will make you wish Hollywood would have given Jodorowsky everything he needed (or that we could at least Kickstart the difference).	A taste of what might have been--and even if you doubt that the completed film would have been as remarkable as Jodorowsky and his admirers are inclined to claim, it's a tantalizing taste.	Jodorowsky's enthusiasm is infectious, and the movie makes a strong case that his ideas, though never realized, ended up permeating later sci-fi movies.	Catnip for those who like to pore over forgotten pop-culture footnotes, this documentary gets plenty of mileage out of its grand question of what-if.	Part thoughtful tribute, part bittersweet reminder of a missed opportunity, Jodorowsky's Dune offers a fascinating look at a lost sci-fi legend.
"Short Term 12" is the kind of teen-oriented movie that's often dismissed as an "after-school special," but thanks to a nimble young cast it's frequently better than that.	The unembellished emotional honesty conveyed in the indie drama Short Term 12 is so expertly handled that it carries the viewer past any hesitations harbored regarding the film's overly familiar storyline.	At times Short Term 12 seems uncertain where it's going, but this matches the circumstances of both staff and residents.	It's one of the best movies of the year and one of the truest portrayals I've ever seen about troubled teens and the people who dedicate their lives to trying to help them.	This is a small film about a society of castoffs, and while it's beautifully acted and often moving, it's also predictable, because it keeps wresting itself into familiar forms.	Short Term 12 is an emphatic, revealing drama that pulls audiences into the perspective of neglected youths.
The lines have begun to show in Belle's tale, which remains enjoyable but feels more like a quaint artifact than the masterpiece it once was declared to be.	Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children.	Not quite the masterpiece we once thought.	The ultimate makeover story has strong, positive messages.	And it is a joy to revisit the timeless pleasures of traditional Disney storytelling, with no attempts to add sizzle from celebrity voice talent or radio-friendly pop songs.	Enchanting, sweepingly romantic, and featuring plenty of wonderful musical numbers, Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's most elegant animated offerings.
Not only does Pokemon -- the First Movie threaten to strike again with the sequel-readiness of its title, but the overlong 89-minute opus aims to thrill tykes by being slightly less than adorable -- meaning you shouldn't trust these creatures any f	This is little more than a promotional effort to draw kids to the theater to get a free card and then encourage them to buy more of the newly introduced characters.	The kids in the audience at my showing were certainly enthralled, and I only fell asleep twice.	Amazingly, it's all more watchable than expected. OK, Disney's Beauty and the Beast it's not.	I'm about forty years too old to take this movie seriously. Or even understand it.	Audiences other than children will find very little to entertain them.
The film's one major fault is that Reilly's character repeatedly acts in ways that serve the plot, but which run contrary to rational human behaviour. By contrast, the shattering downbeat ending is well earned and genuinely shocking.	So harsh, bleak and intense it achieves a level of raw power. A sordid little nightmare of contemporary England.	A well acted, smartly directed horror flick that's gory, disturbing, terrifying and topical.	It doesn't fight shy of a truly frightening final twist, which makes it not only bleaker but also more truthful than virtually every other movie in this genre, which all too often is over-populated and under-humanised.	Works exceedingly well, and will probably stick in your gut for a little while.	A brutal and effective British hoodie-horror that, despite the clichés, stays on the right side of scary.
A genuinely touching crowd-pleaser and a real treat.	The Band's Visit, the first feature by the Israeli writer and director Eran Kolirin, flirts recklessly with obviousness, cuteness too.	Like no fish-out-of-water film in recent memory, it leaves you with the hope that these fish will find their way back to water, and maybe learn to share that puddle before the desert dries it up entirely.	With its attention to detail and careful, naturalistic performances, it's a small slice of life.	The laughter, I think, comes from a recognition of the shape of our own regrets.	The Band's Visit is both a clever, subtle slice-of-life comedy, and poignant cross-cultural exploration.
Hiyao Miyazaki, bless him, continues to be an analog guy in animation's increasingly digital world	Miyazaki's back, and still a force of nature. A weird, wonderful aquatic romp, Ponyo is also a meditation on the state of this blue planet. Catch it.	Admirable and enjoyable and beautiful, but it's a movie for the littlest of the little ones.	Compared to the animated garbage that typically passes through stateside theaters, it's practically a godsend.	comes from a great line of Miyazaki heroines	While not Miyazaki's best film, Ponyo is a visually stunning fairy tale that's a sweetly poetic treat for children of all ages.
They should hand out complimentary razor blades at the end of Revolutionary Road. But if anyone can find the refresh button on the exhausted suburban malaise genre, it's Kate Winslet. And she does.	The film is jolted into hopes and dreams and more importantly, escaping a blah life. But you can just sense there is something else. After all, this film isn't called 'Frank and April Move to Paris.'	Another tale about how suburban domesticity is miserable simply because it's marriage and it's the suburbs.	An extraordinary motion picture that harnesses spellbinding emotional discharge and enthralling disgust, using two of the most talented and captivating stars of today to bring to the screen a masterwork of domestic isolation.	Winslet gives a fearless performance here. It's not her fault her husband has shrouded it in Taste.	Brilliantly acted and emotionally powerful, Revolutionary Road is a handsome adaptation of Richard Yates' celebrated novel.
[VIDEO] Mel Gibson's cinematic mia culpa might not equate to a public apology to the countless people he's insulted over recent years.	Moviegoers probably won't be interested in seeing Mel Gibson in an onscreen train wreck that reminds them so much of the mess he's made of his real life.	There are many scenes in which absurdist fiction intersects with fact that it's depressing and disturbing, yet Gibson's anguished performance is not only believablebut insightful and compelling.	As the movie grows darker, and Walter becomes more dissociated from reality, Gibson convincingly depicts a man who'll have to crack all the way before he can heal.	Jodie Foster shows as a director that you really can make a movie about anything if you do it right. I mean, a guy with a beaver puppet? Come on!	Jodie Foster's visual instincts and Mel Gibson's all-in performance sell this earnest, straightforward movie.
A cute, buoyant sports fantasy, jolted along by a reggae soundtrack and playfully acted by an appealing cast.	If you like underdog movies, you might like this one. Especially if you haven't seen very many.	A wholesome, engaging, frequently hilarious, ultimately inspirational film.	Travelogue shots of happy Jamaicans dancing in the sun give way to patronising comedy.	A energia do elenco e a inspiradora premissa (baseada em fatos reais) convencem o espectador a ignorar os vários clichęs e a torcer desesperadamente pelos bravos jamaicanos.	Cool Runnings rises above its formulaic sports-movie themes with charming performances, light humor, and uplifting tone.
Rachel Mwanza's performance is extraordinary and shows great depth for such a young actress.	While War Witch is a gorgeously made film with strong, natural performances from its leads.	Nguyen's matter-of-fact storytelling proves to be the right match for a life of extraordinary suffering.	War Witch is a remarkably mature portrait that trusts its audience to have their own reactions to its material; it doesn't yank at the heartstrings so much as expertly tune them.	This is a straight ahead essay on warfare at its worst and the survival of the human spirit at its best.	War Witch is a mature, intense drama that embraces the bruatlity of its subject and invites the audience to sympathize with its protagonist's nightmarish circumstances.
All the actors get their Big Moments, but verisimilitude goes out the window.	Not every story comes together into a satisfying climax, and it feels like some time has been wasted with some people that could have been better spent with others.	The archival Kennedy clips aside, the excited radiance of these young characters' faces (and many of them are just extras) may be the best thing about Bobby.	It makes you wish you were watching a biopic of Robert Kennedy instead.	With one film, Estevez has transformed himself from a middle-aged joke into a youthful auteur who has made something beautiful, something he can be proud of, one of the best films of 2006.	Despite best intentions from director Emilio Estevez and his ensemble cast, they succumb to a script filled with pointless subplots and awkward moments working too hard to parallel contemporary times.
A moving love story that is as simple in its narrative gestures as it is rich in color composition.	Zhang's delicate, eager, ingenuous, resilient performance makes the audience feel so close to her it's like we're the butterflies in her stomach.	For the way it gave me room to ponder, for the gift of its colors, and for the delicate performance by Zhang Ziyi... it's one of my favorite films of 2001.	A romantic family film, a true G movie, pure of heart and harmless.	Even the director's most ardent admirers won't be ready for the soapy goo he delivers here.	Beautifully filmed, The Road Home is a simple touching and tender love story.
[A] dull and messy ride through supernatural Clint Eastwood territory.	Jonah Hex is a no doubt a bad film. That said, it has enough good elements to make you realize that it could have been awesome.	The lean story-telling works well for its taciturn characters and spare settings, presented by cinematographer Amundsen, and well scored with assistance from Mastodon.	Had it been available to him, Max Bialystock would have opted for this as his guaranteed flop rather than Springtime for Hitler.	You could do worse than this and if you have been going to the movies this summer with any regularity, you most likely already have.	Josh Brolin gives it his best shot, but he can't keep the short, unfocused Jonah Hex from collapsing on the screen.
Its apparent complexity is all visual patchwork.	Leth shows us the horrendous nature of the period but fails to provide much necessary political analysis, without which it is even more deeply depressing than it might have been.	Asger Leth's Ghosts of Cité Soleil offers a tour of a notorious, hellish slum in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.	The tone of the movie is excessively in thrall to its admittedly charismatic subjects.	Danish filmmaker Asger Leth's gritty documentary is an all-too-real -- and rarely seen -- glimpse into the dark side of Aristide's Haiti.	Asger Leth risked his life to bring audiences this rare and gritty glimpse at Haitian gangs, poverty and politics.
Wait... an all-star voice cast for a computer-animated story we've never heard of before, and it's watchable, too?	The unlikely superhero of this film is the hamster, who brings the funny amid a flurry of weaker gags. But Bolt still has charm - it just won't hit with the adults the way the best animated films can.	While Bolt isn't as funny, memorable or inspired as the animation classic from which it pilfers, it's still beautifully animated, cleanly told, professionally voiced and makes you smile without insulting your intelligence.	There's something both simple and sweet about Bolt, yet epic, that's entirely surprising.	For the first time in years, it feels like Disney has done its namesake proud.	Bolt is a pleasant animated comedy that overcomes the story's familiarity with strong visuals and likable characters.
Scarface has become a touchstone of pop culture, one of the half dozen or so most frequently referenced films of our era.	To be honest, Scarface isn't exactly what you could call a 'good' movie. It's overwritten, overacted and overdirected (not to mention overlong). And yet, against the odds, it still works.	Al Pacino is amazing. a knockout action blockbuster!	Any list of classic guy movies would be incomplete without an appearance from Brian De Palma's Scarface.	As stylized social realism gives way to wigged-out Faustian fantasy, the would-be devastating effects have an oddly slapstick effect.	Director Brian De Palma and star Al Pacino take it to the limit in this stylized, ultra-violent and eminently quotable gangster epic that walks a thin white line between moral drama and celebratory excess.
Why does Hollywood have such a knack for getting romantic comedies so wrong? Who knows, but they owe it to performers like Garner to find a way to do better.	Quirky supporting characters enliven this by-the-numbers romcom.	All in all, it's a pleasantly familiar way to spend two hours.	As far as the mightily abused McConaughey romantic comedies go, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past is actually one of his better outings.	The ending does a big flip flop, but if you go in with low expectations, you'll have a hard not laughing in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.	A retread of A Christmas Carol, featuring Matthew McConaughey in a retread of his Dazed and Confused role, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past lacks originality, humor, and any semblance of charm.
Cage . . . all but sleepwalks through the film with an expression and body language that could be the result of his jockeys being just a scooch binding	This would be fun if director Jon Turteltaub didn't move things along at a snail's pace.	While it may be blasphemous to recommend 'National Treasure', it's probably not far off the mark to say [it will] keep fanatical fans of high-tech hesit movies content.	So bad on so many levels.	It's pretty preposterous and a little too long but kind of fun.	National Treasure is no treasure, but it's a fun ride for those who can forgive its highly improbable plot.
There is enough freshness in the documentary-style observation to make up for any lack of imagination in the storyline.	The movie is alternately brutal and affecting, filled with big dreams and crushing realities.	[F]or all its raw simplicity, the film manages to conjure a veritable library of references.	Sin Nombre is a brutal, dark film that is one of the most moving and memorable that I've seen in a long time	"Sin Nombre" is a convincing verite-styled drama that pulls you into its dangerous universe of desperation and immediacy.	Part harrowing immigration tale, part gangster story, this debut by writer/director Cary Fukunaga is sensitive, insightful and deeply authentic.
It should appeal to adventurous types looking for a more challenging animated feature.	An ephemerally entertaining comic adventure.	A stylish throwback, a pretty work of art in every frame.	Whimsy is alive and well in the movies, thanks to Sylvain Chomet.	Shares the inventive, experimental storytelling found in the works of Miyazaki and the Wachowskis. What a joy to watch a cartoon with your brain turned on.	Richly detailed and loaded with surreal touches, The Triplets of Belleville is an odd, delightful charmer.
...Mann's decision to shoot Collateral using digital cameras is baffling, particularly when you consider how effectively he's used film in the past.	The surprise inside the story is that if we see the film through the eyes of the assassin Vincent it turns from a thriller into a shaggy dog story.	Michael Mann has whipped up a slick neo-noir, rife with mordant humor and hard-boiled action set in a town without pity	but for all intents and purposes this is a two character play on a bare stage...and a damn fine one at that.	Mann works intelligent, polished magic on a B-movie noir script that would (have been) a catch-phrase-fraught action-explosion flick in the hands of most big-budget directors.	Driven by director Michael Mann's trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.
Mind-bending thrillers like Primer are terrific viewing with your teenagers. Maybe if you're nice, they'll explain the ending to you.	Rarely has bafflement been so absorbing and fun.	A smart, clever time-travel game played on audiences and with them	Essentially, it's the story of weekend scientists who build a time machine in a suburban garage. But this nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture.	Confident and well-woven.	Dense, obtuse, but stimulating, Primer is a film for viewers ready for a cerebral challenge.
Serious cinema of the globalist sort.	The poetic visuals create a disorienting sense of being at once immersed in the characters' world and kept at a distance.	Beautiful, poetic, and hard-hitting without the use of excessive force and deeply layered with evolving and regional nuances of feminine experience.	A stunningly imagined account of African immigrant life in present-day Brooklyn.	The imagery in Mr. Dosunmu's film is consistently surprising and lush. Even the straight-ahead portraits of his characters, used as emotional caesuras, are rich in colors and textures. But he's a storyteller, too ...	Director Andrew Dosunmu's style takes some getting used to, but Mother of George compensates with powerful acting, a thoughtful script, and gorgeous visuals.
That devilish idea machine Lars von Trier reached into his bag of tricks and came up with the Advance Party project.	Though not flawless, this is a compelling study, in Dogme style, of a wounded young woman who spends her working life spying on others.	A strange sort of map of the city [is] spread across these fragmented cubes of visual information. And there's also the metaphorical map of the characters' lives, where they're coming from and where they're going.	Thankfully, Arnold's talent is more convincing than her storyline.	A tense and provocative thriller revolving around a past tragedy.	Red Road director Andrea Arnold skillfully parses out just enough plot details at a time to keep the audience engrossed in this seductive thriller.
Dead Man Walking was worth the river of tears I waded through on my way out.	A thought-provoking drama not to be missed or dismissed.	Dead Man Walking could easily be manipulative or exploitative, but it's neither. Instead, this is hard-hitting drama that neither accepts nor offers quarter.	A powerful and provocative film -- not quite a work of art, maybe, but close enough to demand your respectful attention.	It probably isn't for everyone, but Dead Man Walking is a tale that needs to be heard and that will likely provide material for hours of philosophical debate.	A powerful, thought-provoking film that covers different angles of its topic without resorting to preaching, Dead Man Walking will cause the viewer to reflect regardless of their political viewpoint.
This cyberpunk policier doesn't make much sense on a narrative level, but the visuals are gorgeously designed and sometimes genuinely breathtaking.	A complex, rich animated vision.	Ultimately Ghost in the Shell remains a hard sell, with sluggish pacing and sloppy storytelling effectively smothering the strengths of this lackluster effort.	I confess I find it too opaque to make the kind of investment that would qualify me as a real fan. But it should be seen.	O visual e a qualidade da animaзгo sгo incrнveis, e a histуria й bastante criativa.	A stunning feat of modern animation, Ghost in the Shell offers a thoughtful, complex treat for anime fans, as well as a perfect introduction for viewers new to the genre.
The 51-year-old Cruise clearly relishes playing the flawed hero - one who gets to be smarmy, duplicitous, exasperated, intimidated, bad-ass and wise.	High concept action flicks largely live or die by the third act denouement (something that killed off Liman's last blockbuster effort Jumper). No such problems here.	Liman and his screenwriters - Christopher McQuarrie ("The Usual Suspects") and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth ("Fair Game") - make their concept feel fresh with smart setups and ambitious (if underdeveloped) themes.	Edge of Tomorrow is an ingenious action-comedy about how frequently movie heroes would actually die if they attempted that much crazy s***.	Ultimately, this is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it well.	Gripping, well-acted, funny, and clever, Edge of Tomorrow offers entertaining proof that Tom Cruise is still more than capable of shouldering the weight of a blockbuster action thriller.
A real pleasure.	The casually edgy eroticism and constant allusions to old movies are in many ways a mask for the fact that (these) aren't especially interesting people, except to each other.	[A] provocative, sensual feast.	A rich movie filling the viewer with a four-course French meal of sensuality, politics, ideas and character.	An out-of-print postcard of a movie, neither shocking or smart enough to matter in the modern world, and too disjointed to be involving.	Though lushly atmospheric, The Dreamers doesn't engage or provoke as much as it should.
What resonates in the end are the forces behind it, what it says about its time, and how, in fact, it ever happened at all.	WOW! This documentary sticks with you and days later you'll still be thinking about how easy it was to manipulate an entire country.	An eye-opener that focuses on world-shaking events and makes you feel like you are there.	The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is an extraordinary piece of electronic history. And a riveting movie.	Fascinating, intense but disturbingly incomplete and one-sided...an accomplished, involving but highly selective account of a still-charged historical event.	The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is as persuasive and engrossing as it is unapologetically biased.
This scattershot movie, shot over two years, follows the zigzag trail of political satirist Al Franken as he feuds with Bill O'Reilly, campaigns against George W. Bush, and helps establish Air America.	The film only sporadically succeeds in providing biographical information or thematic depth, but Franken is such a witty and thoughtful presence that these flaws don't matter greatly.	Franken doesn't allow the knee-jerk predictability of his liberal pronouncements to deflate the great gasbag that he becomes as the movie proceeds.	Existing in the moment without inquiry or challenge, cinéma vérité fosters exactly the sort of refusal to think beyond the immediate that this film criticizes in right-wing dittoheads.	A documentary in search of a story.	This documentary traces Franken's transformation from humorist to activist with entertaining, if uneven, results.
The constant breaking of the laws of physics -- which is regularly done to create the snappier racing sequences for Torque -- is only one of the ways this film is irritating.	The real auteur here is producer Neal H. Moritz, whose previous odes to reckless endangerment and beer-commercial sexuality include the 'Fast and Furious' films...	Watching it is the closest thing yet to seeing a first-person driving game play itself.	A low grade really bad action flick without a single brain cell in its head...	Um videogame mal realizado.	Silly and noisy, Torque is stylish fun for the MTV crowd.
The entire film is filled with headache-inducing closeups, chaotic camera moves and quick edits.	This is pretty conventional fare, but it's consistently diverting.	Ultra-stylish buddy-cop comedy benefits from a few strong chuckles and lots of high-end mayhem.	Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end.	Even when it's not particularly funny, their interplay is engaging, and their lively, raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time.	Bad Boys stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have enjoyable chemistry; unfortunately, director Michael Bay too often drowns it out with set pieces and explosions in place of an actual story.
The film has some outrageously enjoyable set-pieces, but overall, the convoluted plot and Rodriguez' agenda spoil the fun.	The trouble with Rodriguez is that, while full of ideas, he sometimes struggles to balance quantity with quality. For all its manic action, Machete feels strained and oddly familiar.	The selective charm of this badass brawn-fest might be lost on the non-action crowd after the initial novelty value subsides.	The spirit of "Grindhouse" lives on.	Rodriguez - king of the stretch-a-budget, DIY mentality - is once again paying homage to all the B-grade schlock that inspired him, and having a hell of a lot of fun while he's at it.	Machete is messy, violent, shallow, and tasteless -- and that's precisely the point of one of the summer's most cartoonishly enjoyable films.
"Childhood is a knife stuck in your throat," a dead woman's will informs her twin children. "It can't be easily removed." The siblings will discover that knife is double-edged on an odyssey to discover their roots.	...a compelling and downright powerful piece of work from one of Canada's most promising up and coming directors.	It is not really believable, and yet if it is not taken literally, but as a cinematic prose-poem, it has undoubted force.	This is the film that should have won an Oscar in its foreign-language category this year and didn't.	The movie never feels long, partly because of Azabal's terrific performance.	It's messy, overlong, and a touch melodramatic, but those flaws pale before Incendies' impressive acting and devastating emotional impact.
Enthrallingly retro-cool.	There is one cool, understated scene after another.	There's cool, there's very cool, and then there's a Jean-Pierre Melville heist film.	Apesar de jamais permitir que seus personagens falem muita coisa, Melville leva o espectador a conhecЖ-los atravжs de suas aушes, interaушes e olhares.	The epitome of neo-noir stylishness.	Melville is at the top of his game, giving us his next-to-last entry into the world of deception, crime, and extreme suspense that made him a maestro of the French heist genre.
It's one of the best movies of the year.	It's smart, funny, and charming.	This is an indie crowd pleaser that's much more enjoyable -- in other words, not nearly as horrifying -- as Little Miss Sunshine.	Far lighter and easier to absorb than Thank You For Smoking even if it does sometimes try way too hard to be hip and quirky.	With a charismatic lead performance from Page and a plaintive score of indie-rock songs, Juno seems poised to be the season's youth-culture hit.	One of the brightest, funniest comedies of the year, Juno's smart script and direction are matched by assured performances in a coming of age story with a 21st century twist.
This particular Tyler Perry movie offers some glimpses of the graceful comic talent its one-man entertainment empire can be if he turns down the volume more often.	I entered this moviegoing experience ready for a lot of wincing and eye-rolling. But dammit if this movie didn't make me laugh and cry.	Tyler Perry, the man behind Madea's Family Reunion, is not a subtle filmmaker. But Perry's stories can be emotionally effective.	The cast is likable, and Perry makes good use of the Atlanta locations.	It is exciting to think that someone in Perry's position is indeed challenging himself, as he could presumably coast along on tried-and-true formulas for quite some time.	Daddy's Little Girls boasts fine performances and a poignant message, but is ultimately let down by amateurish filmmaking.
Although its story is horrifying, Osama wisely makes its points through irony and understatement.	The loss of one childhood howls through Barmak's film	Osama manages to surprise you with its story, even though we have no right to be surprised....Already ranks among the best films of the year.	It's gripping, timely, and revealing.	In most ways that count, it's as true as any documentary.	Osama is bitterly honest, deeply disturbing, and utterly worth watching.
When the next American new wave rolls around, it'll be thanks to moments like these, and movies like Gimme the Loot.	Does it sound patronizing to call a slice-of-life film about teenage Bronx graffiti artists adorable? It's not meant to.	Small but bursting with energy.	...a magical, summery treat.	Bolstered by a low-key but assured aesthetic and a soundtrack of vintage soul and doo-wop, the film is infectiously enjoyable, with frequently amusing insights and an affable shagginess.	Thanks to energetic performances from its young leads, Gimme The Loot captures a slice of city life with warmth and exuberance.
A faithful adaptation would almost surely have necessitated that the focus be changed from a father-and-son story to a polemic on gay fatherhood.	The problem with Martian Child is that it wants to be a story about outcasts, but Dennis doesn't come off as a cute little rebel.	Everything you expect it to be, then it goes on for another 20 minutes.	The quirky allure of Joan Cusack can offset a lot of sentiment in a movie, but even she drowns in the goop of Martian Child.	The movie can also be accused of its own sugar overdose as director Menno Meyjes piles on every clichéd situation.	Despite some charms, overt emotional manipulation and an inconsistent tone prevents Martian Child from being the heartfelt dramedy it aspires to be.
So vigorous are those signs, and so unmistakably sore is the inflammation of feeling behind them, that, far from being shut out, we are pulled all too fiercely into the drama's heart.	The Tribe isn't afraid to shed blood, but its stiff acting, disgusting depiction of sex, and inability to completely comprehend the film's message is crippling to the film's overall enjoyment.	While The Tribe does at times feel designed to be shocking, it also demands that you pay attention in a way that we're not used to paying attention in the movies.	You'll want to bathe your eyeballs afterwards but The Tribe does something that's never been attempted before - and probably never will be again.	What sets The Tribe from any other youth crime film is the way it's told, challenging the viewer every step of the way. [Full review in Spanish]	A bleak, haunting drama whose wordless dialogue speaks volumes, The Tribe is a bold, innovative take on silent films for a contemporary audience.
a Ghoulies for the post-millennial crowd, complete with lots of short attention span flash	A top-drawer cast, sympathetic script, a director known for delicious teen edge and one of the great cinematographers of our time have conjured up a topical, whimsical and occasionally magical action-romp through a world we know, but don't fully see.	It has plentiful whimsy, a big enough heart and Joan Plowright in one fine scene, burbling magnificently. It treats its archetypes with all due seriousness: Good must engage evil in a final stand. And fatherless children must try to save the world.	A work of both modest enchantment and enchanting modesty, grounded in a classically Spielbergian realm where childlike wonderment crosses paths with the tough realities of young adulthood.	After lovingly setting up the intricate relationships among its characters Spiderwick loses itself in the action and pretty special effects, only recovering in time to do a rushed, pat wrap-up.	The Spiderwick Chronicles is an entertaining children's adventure, with heart and imagination to spare.
If you can set aside the movie's countless flaws and just go to watch a stupid mindless movie, then you are good to go with this film.	It's like doing a puzzle a second time. It's familiar, it's redundant and it's rarely exciting.	It's too long and too loud and filled with historical disinformation.	Pile on enough action set pieces (which genuinely thrill) and comic relief (which genuinely tickle), and let's all giggle together at the whole mess.	Helen Mirren provides adequate distraction from Justin Bartha's insufferable ad-libs. Yep, he's still comedy poison. Three years hasn't changed that.	A talented cast goes to waste in the improbable National Treasure: Book of Secrets, which is eerily similar to the first film.
Plays more like a celebration than an examination, emphasizing hagiography over history.	Mann's attempt to notate every historical event in a decade dense with them detracts from his biographical subject	While making a great looking biopic that is filled with detail, Michal Mann forgot to make a film that entertains, creating an emotionally void, tone flat portrait of an athlete whose contribution socially and culturally has yet to be matched.	A movie that, at its best, is as brashly eloquent in cinematic expression as Ali was with his fists.	Ali is no disgrace, but it's not much of a performer, especially considering that it is one of the few hyped year-end releases that coulda been a contender.	Though perhaps no film could fully do justice to the fascinating life and personality of Muhammad Ali, Mann's direction and Smith's performance combine to pack a solid punch.
An incredibly charming family flick that, if it were a toy, would come in a box marked, "Recommended for ages 3-90."	What struck me most about the film was the quality of animation. I make this statement about so many animated features but the bar keeps being raised higher and higher.	The film recalls its stylistic forbears at their best: flowing with whimsy, but never at the expense of the beating heart of its human (and animal) characters.	King is obviously a true fan and he's made a true and wonderful Paddington movie ... The themes and concerns of Michael Bond's original series of books and television shows are all there, and the personalities are too.	Through it all runs the touching story of an outsider making a new home for himself, and discovering that in the end, whatever our differences, "anyone in London can fit in."	Paddington brings a beloved children's character into the 21st century without sacrificing his essential charm, delivering a family-friendly adventure as irresistibly cuddly as its star.
Meryl Streep trots out a classic performance in this 1985 Oscar-winner about Isak Dineson/Karen Blixen, a writer who lived in Africa for a short time and experienced all manner of adventure and heartache, dutifully recorded in this Sydney Pollack epic.	Despite its technical assurance and some strong performances, this is a film that favours spectacular landscapes over emotional depth.	The movie is not drama and far from a compelling romance. Needless to say, the prestige and technical polish on display here were enough to win this flick a passel of Oscars.	Out of Africa has the sheen of artsiness and the gloss of two big-name actors. Unfortunately, that`s not quite enough in the absence of a story with vigor and passion.	Streep may convince us utterly that she is in love with Africa, but our views of it are a little too stately to really feel the place.	Though lensed with stunning cinematography and featuring a pair of winning performances from Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, Out of Africa suffers from excessive length and glacial pacing.
Director David Cronenberg's sense of pace is acute, the editing by Ronald Sanders is seamless and suspenseful. And, if nothing else, the movie establishes that chills can be generated without explicit gore and violence.	The classic Walken role, by which all subsequent ones are measured. Possibly the best Stephen King adaptation too.	Cronenberg's most accessible film. Very good, but not great.	...near perfect...	Chilling.	The Dead Zone combines taut direction from David Cronenberg and and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the strongest Stephen King adaptations.
A wonderful savage satire on high school life.	Dark, cynical, but deliciously funny, Heathersis a fascinating look not just at high school but at the way we look at high school.	May be the nastiest, cruelest fun you can have without actually having to study law or gird leather products.	Lehmann ... made a stunning debut with this sharp satire of teen cliques.	Its inanities and glib pretensions are so thick that it mainly comes across as tacky and contrived.	Dark, cynical, and subversive, Heathers gently applies a chainsaw to the conventions of the high school movie -- changing the game for teen comedies to follow.
For all the difference it would make, they could have just booted the Elton John tunes and instead employed, say, Gerry Rafferty's "Baker Street" or Cee Lo's "**** You."	... has its cute moments, but it's the cuteness of desperation ...	Discounting William Shakespeare and the two guys who wrote an earlier screenplay it took seven writers to come up with the script for this.	[It's] tragic alright, but not in the same way as the Bard intended.	In this bright, bouncy Shakespeare take-off, animated gnomes tell the tale of the classic romantic tragedy.	While it has moments of inspiration, Gnomeo and Juliet is often too self-referential for its own good.
The Little Death is a cautionary tale to selfishness and sexual conservatism; told with a desire to be cringe-worthy. It's clever, but it knows it.	It's quite a trick Lawson has pulled off, creating a film that's as genuinely sweet as it is borderline offensive, and funny throughout.	The mood will be too mild and shock-free for fans of Todd Solondz or early Neil LaBute; yet the film is sufficiently cool and quizzical to make you wonder where Lawson will turn next.	The entire enterprise is more annoyingly quirky-perky than truly sexy or psychologically probing.	There are moments of bad taste black comic brilliance in this feature debut.	The Little Death may appeal to fans of dark, risqué comedy, but it's ultimately too rough and uneven to hang together as a wholly satisfying viewing experience.
Provocative title, provocative premise, provocative direction, routine movie.	From time to time during the 99-minute running time, I kept thinking of those old Off Off Broadway impositions on wriggly audiences -- or was it just me who was the transplanted Village square trapped among all the hipsters?	Silly, sick and surreal, it's a triumph of style over message or entertainment value.	[Maddin's] campy style of writing ends up at odds with the emotional power of the images.	Each frame of Maddin's saga will have yielded a memory of cinemania past, even for those with no clear memory of the old movies that echo in this alluring new one.	Guy Maddin perfectly recreates the look and feel of a 1930s in this bizarre picture.
The biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year.	A different film might have been made about a wider sampling of Nash's experiences, but it wouldn't necessarily be a better film, and it certainly wouldn't be this film.	It's a performance that's not just great; it's amazing.	It isn't the device that's so crude, but the execution, which turns Nash's persecutory demons into nuisances that won't leave us alone.	A Beautiful Mind reveals only glimpses of the dark story beneath its sunny imagery, but the performances carry enough weight for it to stand for something.	The well-acted A Beautiful Mind is both a moving love story and a revealing look at mental illness.
Step-setter of its time.	I don't know whether to love it or hate it, procedure for anything scripted by Joe Eszterhas.	Virtually plotless, exceedingly thin on characterization and sociologically laughable, pic at least lives up to its title by offering an anthology of extraordinarily flashy dance numbers.	Well that was a stunning portrayal of the human condition.	There's something real in here, and it could have made it to the screen, but the people involved were too shortsighted to see it through.	All style and very little substance, Flashdance boasts eye-catching dance sequences -- and benefits from an appealing performance from Jennifer Beals -- but its narrative is flat-footed.
seamlessly melds the best narrative mind tricks of science fiction literature with the visceral violence of the best action movies	To my mind better than its successor (for pure freshness) this film shows a keen understanding and love of the sci-fi genre.	One of the most effective science fiction films of recent decades.	The Terminator was James Cameron's second film and remains his most crisply written in every respect.	This is a monster movie, and the monster's role fits Mr. Schwarzenegger just fine.	With its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why The Terminator continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.
So-so last man on earth flick that looks pretty quaint today.	Ainda eficaz, mais de 30 anos depois de seu lançamento.	An extremely literate science-fiction drama.	...not an awful film, just a remarkably dull one.	Unsatisfying sci-fi thriller, though it's not Charlton Heston's fault	It may not live up to its classic source material, but The Omega Man transcends its limitations often enough to offer some mildly entertaining post-apocalyptic thrills.
Silly togas and hammy performances still can't derail this fitting swan song for effects legend Ray Harryhausen; the sequence in the Medusa's lair is his finest moment.	...a camp-infused fantasy flick that will probably work best among younger viewers and those with fond memories of its original theatrical release.	let your mind go, forgive the wear and tear of time and enjoy the adventure	Teenage boys will love it, but the rest of us will be frustrated by the storytelling, the shaky camerawork and the dubiously effective 3D presentation, which distracts more than it offers	Fun spin on the Greek myths despite its general goofiness	A goofy, old-school sword-and-sandal epic, Clash of the Titans mines Greek mythology for its story and fleshes it out with Ray Harryhausen's charmingly archaic stop-motion animation techniques.
Except for the fact that innocent lives are lost here, it would be easy to walk away from Lonely Hearts saying "so what?".	Un buen ejemplo de cine negro, género fuera de moda que aún conserva su encanto.	A gutsy reenactment of the conscience-challenged duo who killed lonely women for their money.	A rather plodding movie.	The movie never quite clicks because it insists on telling two stories - one that is dramatic and one that slowly peters out, neither of which complement each other.	Several genres and plotlines intertwine in Lonely Hearts but don't connect, creating an uneven and unsatisfying film.
This stunning, witty British comedy answers the question "Is it better to go to Oxford University or to get engaged to a man sixteen years your senior?"	A wonderful meditation on understanding life's many choices and hierarchies and deciding to abide or rebel...Mulligan's a lock for a Best Actress Oscar nod and just might win.	A standard-issue coming-of-age story done well enough and without distinction.	This is a tour de force for Carey Mulligan as the intelligent, mature Jenny...	Sarsgaard is great as a very nice man who's really very rotten the more you think about it.	Though the latter part of the film may not appeal to all, An Education is a charming coming-of-age tale powered by the strength of relative newcomer Carey Mulligan's standout performance.
A heartwarming but superficial documentary that's saved from hagiography primarily by the humility and charm of its subject.	A Man Named Pearl not only makes you want to get out there and play Edward Scissorhands but can, at least for its 78 jazz-and-gospel infused minutes, help replenish one's faith in humanity.	A touching bio-pic about a humble soul who encountered racism and responded with love, peace and goodwill towards all people.	This documentary is a head-over-heels tribute to Pearl Fryer, a man who is extraordinary--and not just 'cause his name is Pearl!	Meet the real-life Edward Scissorhands, Pearl Fryar.	Though it lacks moviemaking polish, A Man Named Pearl is redeemed by the interest -- and uplift -- generated by its subject.
This highly uneven comedy by writer-director Adam Brooks might be easier to take if it were less infatuated with its own cuteness.	[Adam] Brooks has had a sporadic career, but when he suddenly resurfaces, he usually provides zesty dialogue and intriguing characters.	The movie offers very real pleasures. Reynolds has terrific chemistry with everyone, and watching him romance three of Hollywood's more intelligent, beguiling comediennes is a pleasure.	Despite one of the more contrived framing devices outside an actual frame shop, Definitely, Maybe keeps you interested in its characters and isn't afraid of complicating your sympathies a little.	A surprisingly clever romantic comedy that starts brightly but unfortunately loses its spark at the end.	With a clever script and charismatic leads, Definitely, Maybe is a refreshing entry into the romantic comedy genre.
Beefcake! Blood! Body slams! Boring! Boring? Well, not quite, but at 150 minutes, "Gladiator" isn't entirely the thrilling, action-packed Roman epic some fans of the genre were expecting.	This is the kind of movie Braveheart will someday grow up to be and it should not be missed.	Russell Crowe is as believable a Spaniard here as Charlton Heston was a Mexican in "Touch of Evil." But director Ridley Scott took greater interest in entwining an empire's intrigue with its people's turmoil than emphasizing bread-and-circus brutality.	Somehow perversely, you become like the bloodthirsty mobs watching the massacres, almost getting up in the theater to chant 'Maximus! MAXIMUS!!' along with the Romans.	Gladiator is a foaming beast.	Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladitorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.
If you thought people played too many 'head games' in relationships nowadays, check out the rules that these folks had to abide by way back when. It's nuts!	Knightley brings Austen's book to glorious, pulsating life.	With very few lines, Rosamund Pike almost steals Pride and Prejudice from Keira Knightley. ... Joe Wright's direction is invigorating.	Director Wright has replaced Austen's intelligence with the moony melodrama of the Bronte sisters.	A glorious tale with an effervescent, career-making performance by 20-year-old Keira Knightley.	Sure, it's another adaptation of cinema's fave Jane Austen novel, but key performances and a modern filmmaking sensibility make this familiar period piece fresh and enjoyable.
Would that the plotline came up to the poster's level of intriguing suggestiveness.	Cashback aspires to be equal parts Volkswagen ad and Nicholson Baker's The Fermata, yet compares unfavorably to both.	A very romantic portrait of a young artist as he ponders love, beauty and living in the moment.	Slickly charming, genteelly erotic and directed with supreme polish.	Cashback's eccentricity holds, but Ellis and his audience would have benefited from a clearer direction and a bit more restraint.	An unlikable protagonist, messy editing, and gratuitous nudity might make audiences ask for their cash back.
Reynolds and Cortés have to make you believe that you're stuck in that box too, to make you feel, somewhere in your subconscious, that your quickened respirations are going to use up the air around you; and that's just what they manage to do.	Not recommended for claustrophobics. It's more or less a smothering experience.	This is shrewdly considered and edited genre work, spiced -- bitterly -- with the right variety of complication.	The hero of the hour is Reynolds, who gives a hugely compelling performance mostly lying on his back. His spine probably deserves its own Oscar for sheer endurance.	Reynolds? portrayal of this Everyman, a guy doing his job in the wrong place at the wrong time, is sympathetic and intensely watchable from the first moment to the last.	Wringing a seemingly impossible amount of gripping drama out of its claustrophobic premise, Buried is a nerve-wracking showcase for Ryan Reynolds' talent.
Flat characters are stuck in underdeveloped situations in this attempt by first-time directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont to recapture the mood of a John Hughes 1980s teen comedy.	Kaplan and Elfont provide a real public service by showing how underage binge drinking can boost bookish students' social lives.	Less of a movie and more a collection of 1980s teen movie cliches.	John Hughes must be spinning in his grave.	It's not supposed to be a revelation--just a pleasant rendition of a teen-comedy trope.	Occasionally clever and moderately intelligent, Can't Hardly Wait also contains too many cheap laughs, recycled plotting, and flat characters.
With its electrifying action sequences, a killer storyline and a maverick comic sensibility, the brilliance of Kick Ass will hit those who want to see it like a thunderbolt.	The film has the courage of its genre convictions. It doesn't have even a whiff of market testing. It does everything on its own terms, and in this age of McMansion movies, that's a super accomplishment.	Despite flaws and inconsistencies, a geeky teen-superhero flick can be worth seeing.	You can tell from scene 1 this was made by someone with vision and conviction, willing to risk offending some so he could wow others. This is no film-by-focus-group. Thank God	Suggested subtitle: Iron Man, You Just Got Served.	Not for the faint of heart, Kick-Ass takes the comic adaptation genre to new levels of visual style, bloody violence, and gleeful profanity.
Ginger Baker has been revealed as a major talent, an innovator and an unlikely survivor. And a not very nice guy.	Lots of surprises and unusual brio. . . in sorting out decades of stories and confusing points of view [with] visual documentation. Very entertaining.	Searingly honest and ultimately deeply moving, this is a fascinating portrait of notoriously antisocial former Cream drummer Ginger Baker, now 73 and still raging.	Any movie that starts with the subject assaulting the director (Baker smacks plucky first-timer Jay Bulger squarely in the face with his cane) is already ahead of the game.	An entertaining doc on the volatile but great jazz and rock drummer, the controversial London born Ginger Baker.	Free of the hagiographic overtones that dog many documentary profiles, Beware of Mr. Baker presents a clear-eyed, thoroughly gripping look at one of rock's greatest -- and most personally problematic -- musicians.
As interesting as the urban legend premise is, it's not enough to sustain the movie.	Manages somehow to be rather endearing.	Someone took their love of urban legends one step too far!	A deeply stupid film.	A low-voltage drive-in movie, made strictly by the book.	Elements of Scream reappear in a vastly inferior vehicle.
Just whiskers away from being really snazzy, "The Faculty" still manages to make for a fun night out.	Rodriguez puts his money into the predictable place - special effects - and you wonder where the imagination went.	This smart, involving sci-fi picture, set in an Ohio high school, pays homage to several genre faves, notably Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing.	Williamson's take-it-apart-and-put-it-back-together stitchmanship has become an arduous borefest.	Surely isn't perfect, but it's a solid genre offering from Robert Rodriguez.	Rip-off of other sci-fi thrillers.
Thank God for coffee, which provides the only caffeinated jolt to the otherwise deflated Kicking and Screaming.	Dylan ... favors loud sound, loud images, loud everything -- only the laughs are muted.	... barely watchable.	A so-so family sports comedy that aims a weak satirical kick at the divided soul of the American middle-class dad, as personified by Will Ferrell.	Most agonizing is the sting of watching Ferrell, after (his) witty performances in Elf and Melinda & Melinda, revert to the same old one-note, dim-bulb clowning.	The script is mediocre and fails to give Ferrell a proper comedic showcase.
Eerie and breathtakingly evocative, the solid I Am Legend nevertheless tries to be too many things to too many people, weighed down with cheap horror-film shock effects and barely passable CGI, instead of trusting in its legitimately captivating	I Am Legend simply sucks but that's putting it a little too mildly when the last man on earth is liable to skip over it in favor of I Am Sam.	though a little too pat in its conclusion, the journey it takes to get there is no less entertaining.	While the sun shines, it's a four-star thriller with a superb turn from Smith. When the moon rises, it's a two-star horror cartoon with some of the worst FX we've seen all year. So, really, it has to average out at...	a solid piece of entertainment	I Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith's mesmerizing performance.
simply one of the finest documentaries I have ever seen ... This is an important, vital piece of filmmaking, and one that takes the artform to a new and altogether fascinating place.	Panh's daring aestheticisation works, transcending the normal genre boundaries confining both personal and political histories.	It contextualizes cinema not only as a form of magic (capable of transformative, elated power), but also of revolution.	A uniquely subjective account of the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s, "The Missing Picture" is the work of Rithy Panh, a Cambodian native who left his homeland when he was an adolescent.	Rithy Panh tells his story with the events recreated, with his many clay figures and settings, from his memories of the atrocities as a boy.	Thrillingly unorthodox and emotionally searing without being didactic, The Missing Picture is a uniquely poignant documentary -- and so much more.
...funny, joyous, touching, and moving...a very personal film and a most-universal one combined.	Such a dazzlingly entertaining mess that it's tempting to ignore the confusion that eventually overwhelms it.	[Crowe] has crafted a cast of fresh characters in a realm where cliches often fester, and he is blessed with actors who fulfill their promise.	The best film of the year.	What a shame things should fall short, given how many enjoyable moments can be found.	Almost Famous, with its great ensemble performances and story, is a well-crafted, warm-hearted movie that successfully draws you into its era.
More than lives up to its clever positioning as the first movie of the new millennium.	Disgruntled baby boomers can grumble, but it's certain today's kids will definitely warm to the new fixings.	As with the original Fantasia, the new film is a mixture of artistically respectable and mediocre moments, which for overall ambition and range, has no parallel in the world of contemporary animation.	...a worthy if disappointingly brief follow-up.	Beautifully designed and presented.	It provides an entertaining experience for adults and children alike.
Unoriginal, unrelentingly vulgar and, worst, unfunny.	The sins of Soul Plane go beyond racial and sexual stereotyping. It's just not funny.	A slapdash affair that pitches jokes at all races, creeds and stupidities, but it turns casualness into a virtue.	This nearly plotless movie follows the maiden voyage of NWA (a moniker that seems to be the extent of the film's wit) through a torrent of stale ghetto jokes in the vein exhausted years ago by the Wayans brothers.	Come back the Wayans Brothers, all is forgiven. Even Scary Movie 2.	A raunchy sendup of Airplane! that never really takes off.
Today's assignment: Watch 'Paradise Now.' Discuss.	A risk-taking but enlightening film that takes the novel approach of examining the Israeli-Arab impasse from the perspective of the Palestinians.	never transcends its political posturing and finds the humanity as profoundly as it means to	Whatever Abu-Assad's motives were for making Paradise Now, his film isn't about politics. It's about two men.	Essential cinema not because it answers questions about terrorist ideology, but because it discovers those questions are disturbingly similar to those about ourselves.	This film delves deeply into the minds of suicide bombers, and the result is unsettling.
Made with all the technical disadvantages of a home movie - dirty and confusing sound recording, sloppy camerawork (but here it's intentional, meant to look arty)	Weekend is the year's wittiest hymn to romance.	Without spoiling what happens and how, it's fair to say the pivot away from Linklater-style sentimentality leaves little room for a sequel hook-up a decade down the road.	hile the credible script and naturalistic acting deserve praise, there's even a thrill in seeing romantic clichés -- you'll spot them all -- embraced anew.	Boy meets boy in this low-budget, acutely observed relationship drama.	It may be a chamber piece but Weekend's revelations on modern sexuality expand far beyond the modest setting.
Lake's head-on confrontation of a problem most people simply wish to ignore is documentary cinema at its most raw and vital.	Kaye shoots in black and white, a stark reminder of how there is no middle ground when it comes to abortion in America... and also, perhaps, a bit of a cushion against the authenticity of Kaye's harsh vision.	No matter where you stand on the issue, Kaye rattles you.	[The] film does nothing to advance the debate but does a great deal to show us what's at stake.	[Kaye has] taken his camera places and filmed things that neither side will want you see.	Lake of Fire's engaging interviews and powerful black-and-white visuals make for a riveting and honest documentary about a very controversial topic.
The film is high on production values but short on heart.	Roman Polanski's new version finds the humor in Dickens' story without glossing over the essential point that a society must be judged inhumane if its treatment of its most unfortunate members is not humane.	It's mannered at times, as you might expect... but the surprising thing about Oliver Twist is how deeply it resonates.	As family fare goes, this makes The Corpse Bride look like Chicken Little.	"Oliver Twist" deserves to be recognized as one of the director's better films.	Polanski's version of Dickens' classic won't have audiences asking for more because while polished and directed with skill, the movie's a very impersonal experience.
Take the "rise" in the title "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" to heart. As in, rising action.	The first film in the franchise to even pretend to match the brilliance of the 1968 original.	Reinvents the franchise with a bold, exciting, intense and fun new chapter that does right by the brilliant 1968 original film while working spectacularly on its own terms.	"Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is first-class entertainment, packed with clever, unsettling and even inspired ideas.	Rarely has a story about the end of the world seemed so boring.	Led by Rupert Wyatt's stylish direction, some impressive special effects, and a mesmerizing performance by Andy Serkis, Rise of the Planet of the Apes breathes unlikely new life into a long-running franchise.
A good mystery tale to tell of a governess in the suburban Chicago area.	Through dogged research and interviews with the (now-grown) children Maier cared for, along with their parents (including Phil Donahue), a profile emerges, and it's fascinating.	Finding Vivian Maier is an intriguing study of Vivian Maier -- a woman who was part artist and part dumpster diver.	A self-styled outsider artist comes into focus in Finding Vivian Maier, a striking documentary undertaken after one of its directors bought a nondescript box of photo negatives at a garage sale.	If nothing else, "Finding Vivian Maier" urges us not to hide our own lights under a bushel.	Narratively gripping, visually striking, and ultimately thought-provoking, Finding Vivian Maier shines an overdue spotlight on its subject's long-hidden brilliance.
Heroism can come in subtle forms. This is one of them.	Born Into Brothels is great humanitarianism, but it's not great filmmaking.	Born Into Brothels simmers with righteous anger, but it never boils over.	The real revelation is the personalities of the kids, who manage to have upbeat attitudes and desires for a better life and deliver them with a genuine enthusiasm of youth.	The resilience that shines in the faces of these children, both in the photos and in the movie itself, makes one angry once more about the incredible waste of human potential caused by social and economic injustice.	A powerful and uplifting documentary.
Roger Moore's final Bond film is a solidly entertaining entry in the series.	Tired 007 effort has ridiculous plot, iffy behavior.	Registers as another high-flying James Bond adventure story.	The worst James Bond film ever.	The strain is starting to show on 007.	Absurd even by Bond standards, A View to a Kill is weighted down by campy jokes and a noticeable lack of energy.
A textured, character-driven story.	After reading a King novel, a reader might tend to want to take a shower; after seeing Darabont's The Green Mile, a moviegoer might want instead to go to church -- but only after taking a shower.	A lumbering, self-important three-hour melodrama that defies credibility at every turn.	The supernatural elements carry an undeniable emotional charge, but the solution to the underlying murder mystery is disappointingly tidy and trite.	Consistently captivating.	Though The Green Mile is long, critics say it's an absorbing, emotionally powerful experience.
How did Shyamalan get it so wrong?	All the while, Shyamalan creates an ever-growing sense of 'Who cares where we are; when will this be over?'	[T]he film works so hard to explain its plot developments that it scarcely has any time left over to dramatize them. Exposition has not merely vanquished mimesis, it has burned its homes to the ground and sown salt in its fields.	The Last Airbender, for all its Shyamalan-style grandiosity, is completely harmless and inoffensive, and at the very least, Shyamalan appears to be having a little fun here.	This empty, misfired epic from M. Night Shyamalan is boring and strengthens the claim that he is the worst director working in mainstream cinema today.	The Last Airbender squanders its popular source material with incomprehensible plotting, horrible acting, and detached joyless direction.
An imperfect movie that's perfectly wonderful.	The overall female performances are excellent in this telling saga that informs us you can't go home again.	The movie cuts deep with its realistic portrayals of human strengths, weaknesses, and relational dynamics.	...the honesty with which [the film has] been imbued is generally difficult to resist.	The many well-drawn characters, make Junebug a pleasure to watch, but the plotting is dull, and the script leaves too many questions.	Aided and abetted by a wonderful cast, director Phil Morrison transforms familiar material into an understated and resonant comedy.
If you love and understand live theatre, or the old-school movie musicals of the 1940s, you will enjoy this much more than people who cannot transfer their minds to that world.	It's childlike in its silliness, adult in its message of how utterly idiotic starting WWII was, and downright brilliant besides.	Sublime.	Everything that can go wrong in an amateur film does go wrong, from the timing to the structure to the pitch of the performances.	Scathingly hysterical.	A hilarious satire of the business side of Hollywood, The Producers is one of Mel Brooks' finest, as well as funniest films, featuring standout performances by Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.
The darker side of Spielberg.	...makes you wonder if Spielberg and series producer George Lucas might have been going through some sort of drug phase.	an unbelievably crass, unpleasant, horrific picture	Don't dismiss Temple of Doom just because, you know, it's kinda stupid.	With the action nonstop there is no time for mere acting, much less for a coherent plot.	It may be too "dark" for some, but Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom remains an ingenious adventure spectacle that showcases one of Hollywood's finest filmmaking teams in vintage form.
What does it all mean? We are never quite sure. All we learn from this relentless saga of mental and physical solitude are the many varieties of suffering one can endure when one feels alone in the universe.	La Moustache dissolves into a meandering annoyance that takes us from Paris to Hong Kong and back again.	It's all a bit like an Agatha Christie mystery whose final moments make it clear that none of the characters could have done it....If you can live with that, then don't miss it.	An intriguing study of identity, marriage and, perhaps, madness.	The film is an unpretentious blank slate--almost totally without point but so unassuming it earns consideration.	Though the premise may be modest on the surface, Carrere uses a man and his mustache that may or may not exist as a springboard into psychological suspense and unsettling questions.
More a garage sale of stories by writer-director Richard Curtis, Love Actually gives its underused British cast something to do with no Harry Potter film this year.	...an arrow from Cupid, and only the most cynical moviegoer would try to dodge it.	The film lives up to its hype.	Classy, so long as you approach it without thought, basic narrative understanding, and resistance to unearned sentiment.	You can go into this expecting to be spoon-fed sugary sap until cotton candy churns out of your ears, and you'll still be surprised by the level of overkill.	A sugary tale overstuffed with too many stories. Still, the cast charms.
Unpredictable and refreshingly inventive, this flick certainly stands on its own as perhaps South Korea's kookiest contribution to the battle-of-the-sexes genre.	Reminiscent of Godard's Contempt, but writer-director Hong Sang-soo--South Korea's foremost chronicler of romantic maneuvering--is more aptly compared to Eric Rohmer for his subtle comedy.	[An] immaculately constructed movie.	A wonderful, serious-minded romantic comedy-drama about a film director's uncertain relations with two successive women while trying to write a script at an off-season beach resort, this is Korean buff favorite Hong Sang-soo's most accessible film.	None of it is very compelling, thanks in large part to Hong's painfully perfunctory camera style.	Hong brings his usual light touch to this well-acted salvo in the battle of the sexes.
The movie ... is pleasant but forced.	For reactionary propaganda, the movie admittedly is fun, in a modest way.	Kate & Leopold is the perfect film-product. Tastes great and won't go to your thighs.	Witless and relentlessly cliched'...this whimsy whoopie cushion of a lame romantic fable is as soggy as a Jackie Collins novel that fell into a jacuzzi.	As far as the acting goes, it's not a good sign when Breckin Meyer ... is the highlight of the film.	Though Jackman charms, Kate and Leopold is bland and predictable, and the time travel scenario lacks inner logic.
A prisoner and parole officer grapple with sins and the need for redemption in this subtle drama of parallel lives.	The craftsmanship is impeccable as is the acting, but the storytelling is where the movie falls down. And with such a poorly realized narrative, it's hard to be enthusiastic about the many things Stone does right.	Collaborations between Robert De Niro and Edward Norton--one generation's most respected actor paired with another's most affected--seem doomed to be defined by acting with a capital A.	Set up as a familiar noir plot, the film veers off into unexpected places, keeping the audience guessing as to the main characters' motivations well after the credits roll.	Norton is outrageously good in the lead role, laugh out loud funny in Stone's earliest incarnation, gradually evolving into someone quite serious.	Stone boasts a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Milla Jovovich, and it features strong dialogue, but it's ultimately undone by its heavy-handed symbolism and overabundant plot twists.
Lagging behind the times in technology, politics, and ideas, Caruso's suspense-thriller should have been made five years ago, when exec-producer Spielberg first came up with the concept; even so, the first reel is dangerous and menacing.	Rarely has a film been so serious in its underlying implications and intent, and yet so moronic in its execution.	Noisy, derivative and thoroughly preposterous even by the standards of 21st-century action movies.	The 1984 nightmare has been bolted to 2001 (as in Space Odyssey) to make one of the better action thrillers of 2008	It's going to make you want to take the batteries out of your cell phone.	Eagle Eye is a preposterously plotted thriller that borrows heavily from other superior films.
Flat, undistinguished workmanship!	A somber and deeply creepy adaptation.	Major junk!	Apt Pupil is about as great as a modern Stephen King horror flick could get.	Tense, skillfully acted!	A somewhat disturbing movie that works as a suspenseful thriller, yet isn't completely satisfying.
The cast is simply terrific and they help roll this storyline to its intended completion. Stanford brings an inquisitive richness to his role as the Benjamin Braddock-ish Oscar, a compelling study of boy-to-manhood and all its uneasy discoveries.	In every respect, director Gary Winick has served up a delectable, entertaining film.	A small, charming indie.	The players are clearly having a ball, never grasping for laughs but rather generating them through a keen sense of their characters.	Tadpole may be swimming into risky territory, but it's delightfully easy to swallow.	Slight, but good-natured and witty.
I love this man, I love this movie.	Don't worry if you've never heard of Bill Cunningham. This delightful documentary is all about getting to know the man - and he's a major, fascinating character.	This is a fascinating portrait of a unique character who has built his own world out the worlds of others. Quite unlike poseur photographers, he dresses, eats sleeps and talks simply; he gets around on a push bike. And he smiles a lot	[A] marvelous documentary.	This affectionate documentary celebrates the veteran photographer who, at 84, still works a tough schedule, taking photos on the street of real people wearing real fashion.	Suffused with happiness and modest charm, Bill Cunningham New York offers a touching, gently humorous portrait of its subject without invading his jealously guarded privacy.
One of those relatively rare comedies that's at once puerile, charming and very funny throughout.	Watching Meet the Fockers is like attending a big, potentially wild and funny party in which the guests pretend to have fun.	The ideas behind Meet The Fockers are the best part of this zany sequel to Meet The Parents, but getting Fockerised is not as funny as it should be.	...just as mediocre and gratingly unfunny as its predecessor...	Though it's good to see [Stiller] back in his stumbling, bumbling element, it's a bummer to see his element wasted in such stumbling, bumbling gags.	Talented cast is wasted as the movie is content with recycling jokes from its predecessor, Meet the Parents.
Echoes of The Bourne Identity flash across the screen in which we follow our hero to an unexpected revelation, usually involving shady characters, a significant 'treasure' at risk and lovely women who may or not be what they seem.	The thriller is fun and action-packed but a few major plot holes and a few lazy twists definitely weigh it down.	This is no more (but no less?) than what we have rather oddly come to expect from Neeson in his late period (Taken, The A-Team) -- not quite a riddle wrapped in an enigma, just a paycheck gig cloaked in an actioner, moonlighting as a travelogue.	Taken was much more amusing than Unknown, which takes itself rather too seriously.	The talented Liam Neeson makes a valiant effort to carry this wannabe Hitchcockian thriller on his solid shoulders, but, alas, he's defeated by an incongruous and improbable plot that gets worse as it unfolds after a promising start	Liam Neeson elevates the proceedings considerably, but Unknown is ultimately too derivative -- and implausible -- to take advantage of its intriguing premise.
full review at Movies for the Masses	The Bounty Hunter's trailer covers everything you need to know about the movie.	There cannot be many of these back-of-the-envelope-cutesy ideas for rom-coms left.	Finally we get a movie with the Jennifer Aniston we knew and loved on "Friends." This movie is about Rachel Green ten years later.	This appallingly unfunny rom-com is a crime against comedy. Lock it up and throw away the key.	Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston remain as attractive as ever, but The Bounty Hunter's formula script doesn't know what to do with them -- or the audience's attention.
"My Soul to Take" is one of the most banal horror films I've seen in the past few years, which makes it surprising that it comes from the mind of horror master Wes Craven, who gave birth to the legendary horror icon Freddy Krueger.	My Soul to Take lacks quality 3D and the one, standout, never-seen-before scare necessary to get horror fans spreading the word to fellow scary movie buffs.	Wes Craven has seen better days and we all have seen better movies; the 3-D didn't add a thing	All might be good for a flask-to-the-theater laugh, if not for the unconscionable price gouging.	A thoroughly dreary, by-the-numbers exercise.	Dull, joyless, and formulaic, My Soul to Take suggests writer/director Wes Craven ended his five-year filmmaking hiatus too soon.
Boasting powerful performances from its lead stars, wonderfully creative direction and a story that will have you howling with laughter and recoiling with horror, it's a film that really resonates.	For an industry that can barely manage to put women in leading roles, The Diary of a Teenage Girl casts a sexually brash 15-year-old as antihero, and succeeds.	It's work, but it's ultimately rewarding work. It tackles some truths that other movies wouldn't touch, not even with a stick and thick gloves.	Newcomer Powley is terrific as the mercurial lead, who's not quite as mature as she believes herself to be, and she's matched marvellously by her grown-up co-stars.	Bold but flawed film about sexual awakening is very mature.	Boldly unconventional and refreshingly honest, Diary of a Teenage Girl is a frank coming-of-age story that addresses its themes -- and its protagonist -- without judgment.
A deeply personal film for writer/director Elissa Down, The Black Balloon is a gentle yet unflinching look at a family strained by the pressures of caring for an autistic teenager.	Feels stitched together from countless coming of age tales and dramas with mentally impaired characters.	The film's vision is neither a grim wallow nor falsely cheerful. It's compassionate but unblinking, and in the end we can't help but admire the genuine strength of how its characters accept their special challenge.	Wakefield anchors the well-paced quieter moments.	Elissa Down's semi-autobiographical film always manages to counter its indie clichés with a sober sense of the volatility that comes from living with an autistic individual.	A tender and witty portrayal of a family coping with autism, The Black Balloon is heartfelt without being schmaltzy or moralizing.
A lovable heroin addict helps a widow and her children cope with loss... Obvious and unconvincing...	...raw and anguished performances...	There is much that is right about this film; it is a shame that it tries a bit too hard and falls a bit short.	A sobering and intimate look at how we handle loss, "Things We Lost in the Fire" is owned by the performance of Benicio del Toro.	Look for Benicio Del Toro's name next to my friend Hal Holbrook and (hopefully) Max Von Sydow when the Best Supporting Actor names are listed.	Things We Lost in the Fire is a well-acted, beautifully filmed reflection on love, loss, addiction and recovery from life's obstacles.
turns out to be quite enjoyable, even if it's not all that good	Sure, it's a Hallmark card, but some Hallmark cards (like this one) are more poetry than doggerel.	...no great shakes, but it's professionally realized and makes good use of the talent at hand.	... nearly every time it has the chance to make a play -- it fumbles.	Despite its good intentions, Gridiron Gang is full of cliches, but at least they're captivating cliches.	The role of probation officer Sean Porter fits Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson like a glove; however, the execution is so cliched, the youths' stories (based on real events), fail to inspire.
Scorsese's masterpiece, which should have won the Best Picture Oscar, is a haunting chronicle of Jake La Motta, centering on the fine line between animalistic brutality and human conduct.	Director Martin Scorsese has a knack for tackling fascinating characters that aren't altogether sympathetic.	a work of religious devotion by a filmmaker to his craft and an apotheosis of Scorsese's promise	This savagely authentic film about flawed masculinity is worth seeking out for another viewing if the summer's toothless blockbuster fodder is getting you down.	A classic that has everything to do with the capacity of even highly successful men to cope with life in general, and women in particular.	Arguably Martin Scorsese's and Robert De Niro's finest film, Raging Bull is often painful to watch, but it's a searing, powerful work about an unsympathetic hero.
Legions of science-fiction fans will feel compelled to approach the ticket booth and scream for a refund.	Battlefield Earth saves its scariest moment for the end: a virtual guarantee that there will be a sequel.	It doesn't help that the film's premise, which sees stoneage cavemen turn into ace fighter pilots with only a week's training, is as naive as that of the 1939 serial Buck Rogers.	Simply put, Battlefield Earth is the worst film I've seen in over 10 years, and believe me, that's saying a lot.	Big-budget, little-intelligence entertainment.	Ugly, campy, and poorly acted, Battlefield Earth is a stunningly misguided, aggressively bad sci-fi folly.
The beautiful thing here is the way Sound City enlivens some fairly snobby ideas about the glories of analog tape without resorting to mere mansplaining.	A total blast to watch, sustaining momentum with a sharp admiration for the thrilling highs and lows of the complex and its rich history with some of the biggest artists around.	An exhilarating history of the studio that spawned countless rock classics, not to mention a welcome reminder to aspiring musicians to step away from the laptop once in a while.	An authoritative, beautifully assembled, personal, even romantic account of one of rock music's most important waypoints, a film which aficionados absolutely should not miss.	In Sound City, a raucous yet sweetly romantic documentary, dinosaurs do indeed rock the Earth again.	Smart, affectionate, and unabashedly sincere, Sound City pairs a great soundtrack with a well-argued ode to one of rock 'n' roll's most fondly remembered bygone eras.
Epic and intimate, A Touch of Sin finally feels as big and complex, as contradictory and sad as, well, China.	The horizon-stretching scenery, shimmeringly captured by cinematographer Yu Lik-Wai, will make you draw breath, in awe but also fear.	Consistently gripping and fascinating.	This major work is cinematic in scope but loses none of the provocative truth that defines Zhangke's oeuvre.	An inside look at the mean streets of modern day China.	Its screenplay isn't as graceful as the choreography of its action sequences, but A Touch of Sin offers enough stylishly satisfying violence to muscle past its rough spots.
The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours.	Vanity is one thing, but Costner's act is beginning to feel like a particularly self-righteous -- and tiresome -- form of pathology. Someone should tell him that an actor's job is to disappear into his characters, not vice-versa.	This is a highly complex film, with multiple flashbacks to different points in Chapel's life, but director Sam Raimi manages to hold it all together, showing us that it all comes down to just one decision.	Unabashedly sentimental (try saying the title with a straight face), this is a touching story of a man at the end of a great career and the beginning of a great relationship. Repeat after me: Great date movie.	On the field, Costner is consistent, but his exploration of Billy's romantic dilemma is superficial and often wooden.	Baseball wins, romance loses.
While moments in this tale of sexual dysfunction are as refreshing as its underused Cleveland setting, it remains more a set of interlocking sketches than a compelling story.	The sexual nature of the film will attract the tweeny crowd but the summer/fall romance between Priscilla and Wayne is the real draw, thanks to [Danny] DeVito.	I felt some of its heroine's pain. She's spent her life waiting for an orgasm. I spent the movie waiting for a plot.	Mischa Barton's acting is about as flat as her chest.	A C- sex comedy with a near A-list cast -- at least in terms of talent -- The Oh in Ohio is one of those movies that promises much but doesn't deliver.	A muddled sex-comedy that feels oddly sexless, The Oh in Ohio packs in too many ideas without establishing a clear identity or objective.
Tight, ingenious!	A flat, formulaic ride!	A marginal engrosser that's short on staying power.	It never really gets inside us, mostly due to its overheated direction and endless Hitchcockian references.	Arlington Road is actually a fairly entertaining, makes-you-think piece.	A suspenseful thriller led by strong cast performances built around a somewhat implausible story.
it was maverick British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg's destiny to transform du Maurier's strange psychological thriller into an emphatically mysterious tale of second sight and looming death in 1973.	Roeg maps Sutherland's disintegrating psyche onto the city of Venice, with its labyrinthian alleys, murky canals, and crumbling facades.	Don't Look Now brilliantly portrays the loves and losses we all experience, our here and now dictated by the fallibility of human nature and the cruelties of time.	Don't Look Now is both a chilling horror film and a fascinating portrait of grief.	Director Nicolas Roeg expertly hits on almost every accent that makes a thriller thrilling and engaging.	Don't Look Now patiently builds suspense with haunting imagery and a chilling score -- causing viewers to feel Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie's grief deep within.
In the end consider this - the only really watchable performance in this movie belongs to William Shatner.	Caine is gone -- and so is the comedy.	This, to me, is a classic example of a sequel that was just made because the first one made money. I didn't even like the first one.	While the original relied on too many pratfalls and a charmless romance, the sequel utilizes snappy dialogue and a female buddy pairing with the terrific Regina King	Sandra Bullock's FBI agent is back in action for a sequel that feels like a distant runner-up in the quality comedy pageant.	Sandra Bullock is still as appealing as ever; too bad the movie is not pageant material.
Run for your lives!	Not enough here that's new.	Tasteless!	The most unfortunate thing about Jawbreaker has to be its blatant imitation of 1989's vastly superior Heathers.	The lowest piece of garbage to hit screens in months.	This throwaway comedy falls victim to its hip sensibilities.
Although much of Rush Hour 3 is in Paris, it's no French pastry. It's more week-old Happy Meal.	Three years later in the sequel, Tucker and Chan had found their groove, even if the movie did not have as many good laughs and great stunt work. Now, though, it is an awkward Greatest Hits Reunion Show, and neither one of them seem up to the task	I hate to use the phrase, "they're only in it for the money," but if any sequel ever exemplified that ethos, it's this one. Ultimately, Rush Hour 3 is a one trick pony whose day has long since passed.	When the outakes are the best part of a film, you know something's seriously backward. Here's Rush Hour 3 succinctly described in one word: Meh.	No matter how fast Chris Tucker shoots his mouth or Jackie Chan flashes his fists, they can't recapture the charm of the original Rush Hour in this third installment.	Rush Hour 3 is a tired rehash of the earlier films, and a change of scenery can't hide a lack of new ideas.
Basically. it's 86 minutes of one man having a staring contest with a door.	Makes you yearn for the days when they got a few things down on paper before they started shooting a movie.	In the end, even the most expert scary-button-pushing can't save a movie this empty of ideas.	They didn't even rip off the classics, for crying out loud!	Only glimpses of the monster are seen in Stephen Kay's supernatural thriller. Unfortunately, the same is true of the movie's plot and character.	The plot is been-there done-that generic, and none of the shock effects can do anything to build up suspense.
Particle Fever is that rare, exhilarating science doc that's neither dumbed down nor drabbed up.	Particle Fever effectively generates appreciation for the tenacity and vision of scientists and the power of dogged curiosity to determine an entire life's path.	A compelling, if sometimes difficult to follow, story.	A subatomic thriller that not only captures one of mankind's most significant breakthroughs, it makes physics and physicists look hip.	All you really need to know about Particle Fever is that it includes footage of physicists rapping. About physics. Wearing giant Einstein masks.	The concepts behind its heady subject matter may fly over the heads of most viewers, but Particle Fever presents it in such a way that even the least science-inclined viewers will find themselves enraptured.
Tennant seems genuinely unsure what mood he's striving for here.	In his big bid for Hollywood stardom, Chow lacks what gave him star power to begin with: an intensely masculine soul of fire and ice.	Intense, mature version of The King and I.	The new movie offers old-fashioned kinds of pleasures.	Entertaining and enjoyable.	Beautiful cinematography can't prevent Anna and the King from being boring and overly lengthy.
May force the audience to confront its own reactions to the dilemmas ... of a society in which people talk at each other, rather than with each other.	Credit goes to playwright Gilman and company for addressing an ugly situation head on. Unfortunately, it's a scenario that lends itself to hot air and that's what the movie blows.	Betraying its theatrical origins, Brokaw's feature debut is a vastly disappointing message movie in which Sarah Jessica Parker (also credited as producer) is miscast, to say the least.	This movie would've been bad in 1983, but at least it would've been original.	The staging by theater director Mark Brokaw, in his first feature, is, well, stagy. I don't mind a movie where people spend a lot of time jawboning, but what they say had better be interesting.	Both leaden and stilted, Spinning into Butter is an unsubtle drama with stagy direction and lackluster dialogue.
Essential viewing, no matter how you cut it.	Reich is no condescending intellectual. He has no contempt for people of the opposite point of view. He even has nice things to say about Bill O'Reilly.	This documentary would be a rousing David and Goliath story even if its hero weren't the diminutive Robert B. Reich.	Using income tax data going back 100 years, Reich draws parallels between the crashes of 1929 and 2008: identical concentrations of wealth at the top and the destabilization of the middle class.	In effect, Inequality For All combines an intro-level college lecture (including animation and PowerPoint!) with a financial horror story designed to frighten all the nation's union-busters.	While it arrives in a glut of similarly themed documentaries, Inequality for All distinguishes itself with a compelling presentation of an important message, as well as much-needed splashes of wit.
So easy to get behind thematically and one with fascinating subject matter, but it's a movie that never gets over some of the stereotypes of its subject matter to present a fully-formed, relatable, human drama.	It's debatable whether the real Woodstock was as messy as Taking Woodstock, which re-creates parts of that now-legendary 1969 music festival experience.	Lee's movie is pleasant enough, but it's too swept up in the spirit it's celebrating to ask the relevant questions.	The biggest surprise of all - it's actually pretty average, at least by Lee's own impeccable standards.	Like its namesake festival it is crazy, naive, full of hope and features extensive drug use.	Featuring numerous 60s-era clichés, but little of the musical magic that highlighted the famous festival, Taking Woodstock is a breezy but underwhelming portrayal.
Director-writer Darren Aronofsky could reasonably be described as ambitious, obsessive and gifted. It's just too bad about his taste.	Darren Aronofsky is a stylistically visionary director trapped by the limitations of his writing abilities. The Fountain works best as a high-concept sci-fi film with all of its seams showing.	The enormous, and sometimes inspired, visual arc of Aronofsky's reach sadly exceeds his narrative's basic grasp.	The new Darren Aronofsky film, "The Fountain," is high-concept, metaphysical trash that shoots for the heavens--literally--but which likely will leave some wondering how they paid eight bucks to walk through the doors of hell.	How can so much style, talent and money be squandered in the service of such blatant airheadedness?	The Fountain -- a movie about metaphysics, universal patterns, Biblical symbolism, and boundless love spread across one thousand years -- is visually rich but suffers from its own unfocused ambitions.
Painful to sit through.	... if you want to watch something brainless, this isn't a total waste.	A little bit of Carrey goes a long, long way--and this Ace Ventura comedy goes on for too, too long.	The first was funny, in a cheap way. The second is a disgrace.	It's silly stoo-pid merriment...for any age.	Nature Calls in this Ace Ventura sequel, and it's answered by the law of diminishing returns.
When the highlight of your movie is a catfight between Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron...well, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it couldve been better	Smoothly constructed, for such a busy piece of work, and Hatcher's ascent to stardom continues.	This movie isn't bad for mere entertainment, but it's overshadowed by other, better movies in the same genre.	A sleek, amusingly nasty screen debut by a film maker whose television credits include an Amy Fisher docudrama.	A sharp, smart movie peppered with A-grade performances from its B-list cast.	A labyrinthine thriller with a host of memorable characters, 2 Days in the Valley is an uneven but intriguing thriller/black comedy.
Though pregnant with possibility, Motherhood fails to deliver.	Too bad the writing didn't include (Thurman) lopping off people's heads, sort of a sequel to her "Kill Bill" roles. Now 90 minutes of that could be entertaining.	In a few brief moments, Thurman's Eliza springs to life... but it's not Thurman's fault that those moments are few and far between.	Many films have been made about the perils of parenthood, but none with a more attractive and entertaining mom on the verge of a nervous breakdown than Uma Thurman in Motherhood.	Portrays a time-starved mother who is willing to throw herself into parenting but also realizes the need to care for her own soul.	Despite Uma Thurman's comic skills, Motherhood's contrived set-ups and cliched jokes keep this comedy from delivering laughs -- or insights into modern parenting.
The movie was a bear to make and it shows onscreen, parading around a series of mesmerizing set-pieces that look deliciously hard-earned in ways our current CG-drenched filmmaking climate never allows.	...the undersea adventure may have you waterlogged after the first hour.	Brilliant at sustaining tension and interest.	What ultimately saves the film are its extraordinary sets and phenomenal Oscar-winning visual effects.	Suffers due to its incredible length and slow pace, but intriguing, nonetheless.	The utterly gorgeous special effects frequently overshadow the fact that The Abyss is also a totally gripping, claustrophobic thriller, complete with an interesting crew of characters.
Don Siegel's superb little effort, with its matter-of-fact isolation of hero Kevin McCarthy (ironic, no?) from the smarmy complacency of a small town gone to hell -- and way beyond -- points the way to his gripping action films of the 60s and 70s.	Jack Finney's magazine story-turned novel "The Body Snatchers" has proven remarkably resilient through the years.	Its defining trump is that it is transparent, possessing a strong political undercurrent visible beneath its surface.	Although expertly remade twice - in 1978 and 1993 - and rather less successfully in 2007, the original is still the most striking, with a justly famous scalp-freezing ending.	The first--and still best--version of the Cold War sci-fi, despite compromised ending that was imposed by producer Walter Wanger on the director to make the tale less downbeat and anarchic.	One of the best political allegories of the 1950s, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an efficient, chilling blend of sci-fi and horror.
An embarrassing waste of time, and nothing even resembling the guiltiest of guilty pleasures...	The Boondock Saints, sorry to say, wasn't worth the trouble.	A ridiculous, self-important amalgamation of rehashed macho posturing and slow-motion bloodletting. Do yourself a favor: do not attend a convocation with these Saints.	If you can't sit back and enjoy an entertaining popcorn flick like The Boondock Saints, then you'll probably never understand the difference between the movies and real life.	[A] dim-witted, aesthetically clunky Tarantino clone.	A juvenile, ugly movie that represents the worst tendencies of directors channeling Tarantino.
Dogma is not supposed to be taken seriously, which is as it should be.	Dogma should be offensive to anyone who expects more from a movie than two hours of a filmmaker's musings on every religious notion that ever came into his head.	Agonizingly foul-mouthed and adolescent, surprisingly empty and ineffective as a satire of organized religion, and at least 30 minutes too long.	Presents some zany commentary on institutional Christianity, angels, demons, modern day immorality, and the mysterious presence of God. Wow!	The fact that it has a great, intriguing premise only stimulates my dislike -- it promises great things, and never delivers the goods.	Provocative and audacious, Dogma is an uneven but thoughtful religious satire that's both respectful and irreverent.
A crowned-heads soap opera that balances effectively between pomp and melodramatic circumstance.	The film moves along crisply, looks great and stimulates the brain (I am a sucker for torrid romances propelled by quotes from Rousseau and Voltaire.)	Arcel's classically old-fashioned candlelight-and-carriages take on the bosom-heaving, aristocratic love triangle is a compelling if slightly overlong effort.	The performances are powerful and the set pieces are exquisite, but the conclusion will leave you feeling enormously agitated thanks to what seems like the encouragement of thickheadedness.	It's as interesting a portrait of late 18th-century life as Amadeus or The Madness of King George.	A Royal Affair is a lavish and sumptuous costume drama with a juicy story to back it up.
As Shakespeare would have certainly written if he'd been on the movie beat, "Double, double toil and trouble, movie stink and critic bubble/'Hocus Pocus' has no focus/has no rhyme, has no reason/ and is... out of season."	It's acceptable scary-silly kid fodder that adults will find only mildly insulting. Unless they're Bette Midler fans. In which case it's depressing as hell.	As a family film, Hocus Pocus is passable --- provided you don't have particularly high standards.	With Bette Midler and her onscreen sisters shamelessly hamming things up, it looks as if those involved in making this inoffensive flight of fantasy had more fun than anyone over 12 will have watching it.	Director Kenny Ortega shows little feel for the material. The three leading ladies, encumbered by layers of latex, huge wigs and voluminous costumes, are rarely allowed to cut loose.	Harmlessly hokey yet never much more than mediocre, Hocus Pocus is a muddled family-friendly effort that fails to live up to the talents of its impressive cast.
Give it an A for effort, C for execution. As cool/creepy as it seems, Daybreakers just doesn't quite measure up to its potential.	OK, I surrender -- this is the age of the vampire and it's best to go along for the ride.	'Daybreakers' has plenty of clever social relevance and biting political commentary mixed into the pot of gore and violence. It's got both style and smarts.	Just when you thought it was safe to be a vampire , corrupt corporate politicians spoil the fun.	Yeah, its another vampire film, but this one deals with the global end game instead of emo teen angst.	Though it arrives during an unfortunate glut of vampire movies, Daybreakers offers enough dark sci-fi thrills -- and enough of a unique twist on the genre -- to satisfy filmgoers.
Fans of sport and brash, boisterous comedies will find a lot to love here.	Sandler's serious moments are dramatically deadly, while a little of his comedy goes a long way.	It's just a minor little film that you forget until the next Adam Sandler flick comes along.	Sandler at his crazy, comical best....side-splitting stuff~	Sever those cerebral lobes, sit back, and enjoy a gleeful, energetically stupid comedy.	Those who enjoy Adam Sandler's schtick will find plenty to love in this gleefully juvenile take on professional golf; those who don't, however, will find it unfunny and forgettable.
A return to what sci-fi was meant to be: Not a way to titillate teenage boys, but a means of finding a context for complex human issues.	A gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem.	So beautifully made (everything in it is understated except the gorgeous good looks of its stars) and turns out to have such real cumulative power that it is worth holding out to the end.	For all its flaws, though, Solaris is a good try and a definite improvement over the dull remakes Soderbergh's been sleepwalking through lately.	This bit of pseudoscience has been made appropriately enigmatic by Soderbergh and company.	Slow-moving, cerebral, and ambiguous, Solaris is not a movie for everyone, but it offers intriguing issues to ponder.
The concept here is fun -- good and evil dragons of ancient Korean legend do battle in modern-day Los Angeles -- but a lazy and amateurish script and embarrassingly hollow acting hobble it right out of the gate.	A movie without a single redeeming quality that we highly recommend.	By no reasonable reckoning can the film be considered a competent piece of cinematic storytelling, yet somehow the movie transcends its silly screenplay with over-the-top action and visually imaginative battles.	DRAGON WARS knows it's dumb, and just has fun. It's my new guilty pleasure!	Destined to go down in history as one of cinema's most blunderingly, catastrophically bad big-budget films of the last few decades.	Dragon Wars' special effects can't make up for an unfocused script and stale acting.
While In Good Company has a few moments of comedy that work, it inescapably feels like a sitcom.	An amusing and unusually compassionate look at today's corporate culture.	A so-so script but great performances.	If the film's final third didn't get all gooey on us ... then the movie might have been a total triumph.	...charts the rhythms and relationships that define our everyday lives.	The witty and charming In Good Company offers laughs at the expense of corporate culture.
The Man With No Name faces a whole lot of pain in Clint's thrilling directorial debut.	A highly enjoyable thriller.	Un suspense qui profita abondamment de la largesse d'esprit du cinéma américain de l'époque, peut-ętre męme un peu trop...	Clint Eastwood's first film as a director, and first investigation into the anxiety at the root of the Eastwood persona	For his directorial debut, Clint Eastwood opted to make this relatively straightforward but hopelessly dated Fatal Attraction clone (er, precursor).	A coolly calculating psychological thriller that manages to scare the audience even if it is just using textbook thrills.
A painful and compelling masterpiece.	Director Nichols, in his auspicious Hollywood debut, and scripter Ernest Lehman smartly keep Albee's corrosively witty black comedy intact, allowing their ensmeble, including Liz Taylor, to dig deep and turn intensely entertaining performances.	If one examines Albee's The Zoo Story, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and Tiny Alice as three views of the struggle for faith and the Christ myth and its nuances, the plays, on a particular level, gain a substantial meaning.	Scathing scream of a black comedy that's based on a play by Edward Albee.	A vitriol Valentine to that most public of famous marriages, The Battling Burtons, in their finest work (together).	Led by a volcanic performance from Elizabeth Taylor, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a scathing adaptation of the Edward Albee play that serves as a brilliant calling card for debuting director Mike Nichols.
Rest easy, America. The Guest can take on ISIL single-handedly--after entertaining the terrorist army with a clever script.	I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and if you've been lamenting the dearth of violent genre movies that don't assume the audience to be morons, you will too.	The Guest is assured of cult classic status in years to come, but will hopefully entertain the masses with its winning blend of crowd-pleasing humour and suspense.	At the centre of it all there's Stevens, and it's hard to overestimate just how much fun he is here.	The Guest isn't here to deliver an earnest social message about the state of veterans' affairs. Instead, the way good horror movies do, it channels our collective fear, guilt, and rage by creating a monster.	Boasting enough intelligence to bolster its darkly violent thrills, The Guest offers another treat for genre fans from director Adam Wingard.
Visually and dramatically, Lee pulls out all the stops, but it's Washington's performance that really energizes the film, and he's an exhilarating presence throughout.	Malcolm X isn't pro-Black or anti-White: it has the intelligence to see the nuances in everyone.	richly layered	Lee's film suffers from message over substance and is slightly tedious as a result.	An ambitious, tough, seriously considered biographical film that, with honor, eludes easy characterization.	Anchored by a powerful performance from Denzel Washington, Spike Lee's biopic of the legendary civil rights leader brings his autobiography to life with an epic sweep and a nuanced message.
A canny franchise escapade; it gets the job done.	This long-awaited future franchise is a competent seat-warmer at the box-office table for the two weekends preceding George Lucas's Attack of the Clones.	... the most faithful 4-color to film adaptation to date. And yes, it's amazing.	This Spider-Man is a sticky popcorn film, that should appeal to a Multiplex audience looking for an escape film.	This is one of those rare adventure movies in which character, not violence, is the backbone of the film.	Not only does Spider-Man provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire.
Director and co-writer Cao Hamburger presents all of this in such a timid and sanitized manner that one would suspect childhood wasn't a messy affair. Unfortunately for Hamburger, we've all been there, done that.	An utterly convincing depiction of childhood loneliness and uncertainty, in a world I'd never seen onscreen: the Orthodox Jewish community of Sao Paulo.	The acting is uniformly fine.	Nicely mixed lighter-than-air comedy with poignant moments amid Brazil's political authoritarian governments in the 1970s.	Sensitive, delicate and involving...	Hamburger deftly refracts the sociopolitical tumult of early '70s Brazil through the lens of a young boy's coming of age, and Joelsas' performance is wise beyond his years.
An action film of intelligence and compassion.	...the movie is curiously flat, void of any emotional context.	So much has gone wrong for The Alamo that it almost feels like piling on to say any more about it.	You may or may not remember "The Alamo."	In re-enacting the actual events surrounding the storied 1836 battle, this oppressively solemn historical-action movie is both elegiac and trivial.	Too conventional and uninvolving to be memorable.
With Ms. Bullock playing a lady only a polar bear could warm up to and Ryan Reynolds' exquisite balancing of the dynamics of the situation, this romantic comedy finds a sweet comfort level.	A likeable romantic comedy featuring two charismatic leads who can't quite escape the shackles of a predictable storyline.	Despite the fact The Proposal is predictable and stuffed with recycled schtick, it's surprisingly enjoyable and completely charming. If it was a baby, you'd want to pinch its little cheek -- it's that cute.	Bullock and Reynolds play off each other with a real zing and zeal, but the narrative journeys down an avenue so formulaic the viewer's heart shatters at the very realization of it.	Oh Sandra Bullock, why do you do this to yourself?	Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds exhibit plenty of chemistry, but they're let down by The Proposal's devotion to formula.
A heaping pile of cliches doesn't prevent this touchingly simplistic tale from exuding a strong and universal emotional appeal.	There's no reason this cliché-ridden French drama should work, but it does, and there's the beauty of it.	The story is sentimental and slight, but the chemistry between Depardieu and Casadesus makes up for any faults.	It's a lovely French character study.	Leaves the sugar at home but still provides a sweetly simple experience.	It's sentimental and treacly, but that's not enough to prevent My Afternoons with Margueritte from being truly affecting.
Surely as satisfying as any of the delicious-looking food served at Louis' restaurant -- and is as full of surprises as any dish Udo ever concocted.	Watching this enjoyable film is like sampling a table of tasty hors d'oeuvres.	One of the neatest aspects of the film is that it treats this restaurant like a theater set on a revolving stage.	It's not Big Night, but there's much worth tasting here.	A movie of rich specifics and stylistic creativity that clearly comes from the heart	With the aid of a witty script and a well-acted ensemble, Dinner Rush is a tasty dish.
The film is at its best at what should be the hardest task, interesting the audience in the finances and the trading and at the same time being educational.	Boiler Room does a lot of nice things; too bad it doesn't manage to do them for a full two hours.	Not a bad debut for a kid from Queens who never even went to film school.	Boiler Room deserves credit for taking a very fresh look at some well-worn themes, showing a world where money rules and the good guys not only finish last, they get eaten alive.	Boiler Room works as a morality play by presenting us with people whose moral compasses it's actually possible to care about.	Its ending is disappointingly tidy, but Boiler Room boasts just enough sharp writing and brisk pacing to make getting there worthwhile.
Ken Loach has come up with an upbeat story about a man who is at his wits end with life.	Cantona, big and bearded, is a genial Gallic guru. It's hard not to be swayed by his optimism, his sagacity, his generosity. And the optimism and generosity of Loach's film.	Loach strains hard for fun in Looking for Eric, but he's like a jokester who doesn't know how to tell a joke.	Loach is trying to be jaunty here, and every once in a while his efforts pay off.	Lighter than the usual Ken Loach feature, Looking for Eric marks a departure of sorts for the solemn director, but ultimately, it's a minor work.	Ken Loach's latest is an uplifting, entertaining and amusing socio-drama featuring a match-winning performance from Eric Cantona.
It pulls no punches in its informed outrage against the food industry, zeroing in on the rampant use of sugar and its many multisyllabic variations.	Satisfies the hunger of those who normally consume issue films if no one else ... it's just not a doc that will reach far enough.	Style alone doesn't make a great documentary, substance does, and on that count Fed Up absolutely delivers.	Thumbnail portraits of morbidly obese kids introduce a plaintive note to the argument, especially since, as the documentary notes, many school cafeterias are now indistinguishable from fast-food joints.	The effect is stark, disturbing and inspirational, if you are willing to listen.	Compelling and troubling in equal measure, Fed Up is an advocacy documentary that earns its outrage.
Mountain Patrol: Kekexili is sometimes slow going, yet it builds in power as nature begins to take its toll on the patrol, and its cumulative effects are haunting.	This second film by Chinese director Lu Chuan is a solid and atmospheric drama.	The spirit of the hardboiled American Westerns of the 1950s wends its way through this moody, panoramic Chinese chase thriller.	Lu Chuan's film may be an old-fashioned outdoor adventure. But it's a harrowing one that leaves little doubt that there are some outdoor regions human beings have no business in, however noble their reasons for going there.	Mountain Patrol, peppered with shocking revelations of just how suddenly and brutally death can come calling, has the look and feel of a documentary.	In a setting both visually stunning and cruel, this Eastern film evokes the epic spirit of old-fashioned Westerns.
Delivers some thought-provoking questions about our digital age, numerology, and the hubris involved in all projects designed to decode the mystery of the universe.	Pi is an interesting film. Not a particularly good one, but interesting nonetheless.	I can virtually guarantee you won't see anything else like it this year.	A compelling and, most importantly, original science-fiction film which has that rare ability to also be believable.	Destined to pick up a cult following.	Dramatically gripping and frighteningly smart, this Lynchian thriller does wonders with its unlikely subject and shoestring budget.
More of the same...only less funny.	If you haven't seen the target film, not only is it not funny, it becomes totally pointless.	In a classic 'too many cooks' scenario, Scary Movie 2 never manages to put even the semblance of a plot together.	The screenwriters take desperate measures with so much lame sex jokes, body flashes, and disgusting bathroom humor.	Scarily awful -- this spoof horror franchise needs a stake driven through its heart, and quick...	Instead of being funny, this gross-out sequel plays like a sloppy, rushed-out product.
Its dazzling special effects make its combatants flip and fly, spin and soar, all the while punching and kicking each other like jackhammers, only to leave viewers utterly unmoved.	There is nothing... I repeat, nothing worthwhile in this film.	This tedious hodgepodge of martial-arts mayhem, bogus mysticism and computer-generated special effects doesn't even pretend to have a plot.	Never -- at least not since the first Mortal Kombat -- has tedium been so loud, so full of backward flips and flying fists to the kissers of centaurs from another realm.	The video game is much more fun, of course.	With its shallow characters, low budget special effects, and mindless fight scenes, Mortal Kombat - Annihilation offers minimal plot development and manages to underachieve the low bar set by its predecessor.
Rendition wastes a serious amount of time and effort force-feeding the viewer lessons on how injustice breeds contempt. For the sequel, I hear the producers plan to explore how fire is hot and water is wet.	[Hood] can be accused of one-siding the debate over interrogation tactics like water-boarding and electrocution. But since when do movies have to be fair and balanced?	Rendition is a reminder that, in the wrong hands, political outrage can be a slog.	Laughably melodramatic and agonizingly inert.	Rendition has been made with an awful lot of volume and outrage, but you wish it had some intellect and artistry, too.	The impressive cast cannot rescue Rendition, which explores complex issues in woefully simplified terms.
Takes a turn for the worse after its first half-hour, morphing into an overstuffed exercise in gore and stupidity that will leave your ears ringing and your eyes rubbed raw from disbelief.	By the film's conclusion, Willis grows tired of the holes in his plot and starts putting holes in the bad guys. This from a guy who swore off action movies.	Willis travels a well trodden road...screenwriter Doug Richardson...manufactures one obstacle after another for our hero	Willis wears the character like an old glove; he's a decent, no-nonsense character torn by the threat to his family but prepared to get the job done.	...harrowing and brutal, and, as a result, extremely tense.	Grisly and cliched, audiences may feel they're being held Hostage.
A total freakout that will slow-burn itself into your brain. Prepare to feel creepy.	The shock imperative takes on a life of its own and floats away from the lengthy setup.	A strangely refreshing punch in the gut that puts the horror back in 'horror movie.'	Mesmerizing? You bet. Thought-provoking? Certainly. Comforting? Sure. Like a swan dive into a pool of spikes and razor wire.	It turns into a hallucinatory nightmare of female revenge that will pin back the audience's eyelids.	An audacious, unsettling Japanese horror film from director Takashi Miike, Audition entertains as both a grisly shocker and a psychological drama.
It's all yodeling Shakira ballads and emotional shots of the would-be lovers staring at each other until their cheeks pale from exhaustion	Listless, poorly scripted, badly acted and displaying an unforgivable misinterpretation of its source material, Cholera is easily one of the worst adaptations of a great book ever mounted.	If further proof were needed of my dispiriting theory that the best novels rarely make the best films, it is to be found, richly scented and sumptuously packaged, in Love in the Time of Cholera.	Would that Newell's visual panache were as robust as his understanding of the novel's romantic implications, but what the film lacks in brio it makes up for in reverence.	Newell has done some fine work in all sorts of genres, from Four Weddings and a Funeral to Harry Potter, but in Cholera he seems to be chronicling a half-century of events, passions and desires as a tourist, not a native.	Though beautifully filmed, the makers of Love in the Time of Cholera fail to transfer the novel's magic to the screen.
Deficient in the comedy of reticence discouragement that is Aardman's (or maybe just Nick Park's) unique strength. I don't want to say the Englishmen were corrupted, but I think they allowed their strongest, quirkiest instincts to be tethered.	Deliciously witty, funny and clever, endlessly inventive and filled with Aardman's trademark eye for detail, Flushed Away has more for grown ups than for kids, although no age group could complain of being under nourished with entertainment in this film.	It's infused with a freewheeling energy - helpful given the story's been-there-done-that vibe.	Flushed Away will probably make you want to revisit some old, classic Wallace & Gromit short. The Wrong Trousers, perhaps. That would be spot-on.	Little kids are sure to be bowled over by Roddy's reluctant heroism and Rita's resourcefulness, while the more grown up among us should appreciate the gleeful pokes at pop culture and Anglo-French relations.	Clever and appealing for both children and adults, Flushed Away marks a successful entry into digital animated features for Aardman Animations.
A dull yet extremely self-important drama about rich, badly parented kids who feel sorry for themselves.	The Art of Getting By is a coming-of-age story about a geeky misfit who won't do any school work. It's not as riveting as it sounds.	Ultimately it's just hard to warm to George or care a jot about his teenage angst.	There's an inherent lack of dramatic thrust here. If George can't even admit he's in love, I'm not going to wait around for him to figure it out.	There are pieces of The Art of Getting By that are interesting or entertaining, but the whole is far less than the sum of its parts thanks to the lopsided romance at its center.	A sitcom-level twee mess that bakes in the typical manic pixie dream girl and boring, withdrawn boy hero.
Lee seems well aware that the reason to catch the flick is to catch the comics.	Judging by audience reaction -- out of their seats, in the aisles, standing up, swaying to the music, howling in recognition of material that hit home -- these kings rule.	Bernie Mac is the best way to close out the show. He lunges straight into the audience's face, politically incorrect and proud of it.	The Original Kings of Comedy can make a person sick in two ways at once -- through its lowdown raunch and through the spasms of laughter that use stomach muscles one might not have known existed.	The show has class.	If you want lots of laughs and don't mind some profanity, The Original Kings of Comedy can deliver.
Recalls quiet freak-outs like L'Avventura and Repulsion.	[Ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art, music and metaphor.	Ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented, and based on three short films and two features, here's betting her third feature will be something to behold.	A work of astonishing delicacy and force.	Ramsay, as in Ratcatcher, remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid.	Morton quietly makes this quirky, enigmatic mood piece a compelling watch.
With films such as Funny People and This Is 40, Apatow has toyed with finding the right blend of the serious and the hilarious and finally hits it here.	Interestingly, the movie is actually saved from a very average outcome due to its large and unconventional supporting cast.	In a film filled with cameos by comedy legends and SNL cast members, LeBron James and Jon Cena get by far the biggest laughs, which is maybe a problem.	Schumer's script does offer, for much of its game-time, some anti-heroine unlikeableness, anti-rom-com laughs, and a sense that, hey, pretty much all relationships--family, friends, lovers--are wonky and wrecky.	A traditional romcom with an entirely untraditional difference: a strong, sexual female lead.	Trainwreck drags commitment out of all but the most rom-com-phobic filmgoers with sharp humor, relatable characters, and hilarious work from Amy Schumer.
First-timer Dee Rees offers a fresh take on the overfamiliar coming-out genre.	Pariah is a tender, sporadically goofy, yet candid examination of emergent identity.	Smart, sad, empowering film about a teen coming out.	You don't have to be black or lesbian or even know someone who's gay to appreciate "Pariah"; you just have to have gone through or be going through the process of growing up.	Any movie that opens with Khia's 'My Neck, My Back' is my kind of flick!	Pulsing with authenticity and led by a stirring lead performance from Adepero Oduye, Pariah is a powerful coming out/coming-of-age film that signals the arrival of a fresh new talent in writer/director Dee Rees.
A blood-spattered, tongue-in-cheek horror comedy that features plenty of low-rent gore, some extra-cheesy lines and some terrific performances.	Debut director Sean Byrne has carved out a flick to stand beside Brian De Palma's high school horror classic Carrie, such is the beauty and brutality of his execution. It's the best entry to the Aussie horror canon since Wolf Creek.	There is clearly a lot of ambition to The Loved Ones and the near-brilliant leading performances help make the film a unique and terrifying experience.	The pacing is choppy but Byrne serves a thick, satisfying stew of savagery and surprise sympathy, generously flavoured by lashings of black humour.	It's got heart, gore, suspense, and an unusual family-style drama you won't likely forget... and Lola is a terrific character: pretty scary in pink!	Successfully mixing the conventions of the teen and horror genres with a twist, Australian director Sean Byrne makes a striking directorial debut.
A wonderful fairy tale, made for today's audiences.	With improbable finesse it buffs up some of the oldest tropes of storytelling and then gives them a mischievous tilt, so that we appear to be watching a celebration of a genre and a sneaky subversion of it at the same time.	Not coincidentally, most of the really good stuff here will go over young kids' heads.	The story has rollicking moments and the visuals are amazingly realistic.	Mischievous enchantment with something to titillate all ages.	While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales, the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disney's nose, provide a moral message to children, and offer viewers a funny, fast-paced ride.
An engaging experience.	Amateur camera work and conspicuous plotting reduce the film's regional sensibilities to sleep-inducing pap.	It feels like a real window on the lives of disenfranchised youths -- these are in South Atlanta -- as they make their way in a society that doesn't cut them any breaks.	But the story behind ATL (credited to Antwone Fisher, the onetime Navy man in San Diego who had a movie made about his life four years ago) for the most part feels genuine and resonant.	Despite an occasional whiff of cheese, it's mostly a fresh, funny, coming-of-age story that feels authentic.	Strong lead performances and catchy musical interludes rescue this coming-of-age story from its formulaic script and uneven direction.
An ill-conceived and frankly quite silly Bond-meets-sci-fi experiment.	It's exactly that ridiculousness that makes it so enjoyable.	007 goes Star Wars in this, the silliest of all Bond's adventures.	Typical Bond stuff.	Moore is in full swing	Featuring one of the series' more ludicrous plots but outfitted with primo gadgets and spectacular sets, Moonraker is both silly and entertaining.
All the things we hope from in a fright film with characters we recognize as very much like ourselves are toyed with.	Are you complicit for watching the stuff? Would you be less of a jerk if you walked out? Is [Haneke] wallowing in the thing he's critiquing and consequently a bigger jerk?	Basically torture porn every bit as manipulative and reprehensible as Hostel, even if it's tricked out with intellectual pretension.	Director Michael Haneke abhors mindless cinematic violence as much as you do. He just has a different approach: high-minded shock therapy.	Funny Games is like a graduate thesis on screen violence. It's less successful as a compelling piece of cinema.	Though made with great skill, Funny Games is nevertheless a sadistic exercise in chastising the audience.
Director David Lynch has created an eerily compelling atmosphere in recounting a hideously deformed man's perilous life in Victorian England.	Has the look and texture of an authentic document, elevated by the hand of a artist with a singular vision	My apologies to the fans of the absurd, but I'd call this David Lynch's one true masterpiece.	In this follow-up to the amazing Eraserhead, David Lynch exposes undercurrents of anguish along with an emotionally accessible tale of Merrick's nobility--a Victorian morality play disguised as an elegy to freakishness	Avoids the obvious traps of simple romanticism and playing into sheer pity for Merrick's noble plight.	David Lynch's relatively straight second feature finds an admirable synthesis of compassion and restraint in treating its subject, and features outstanding performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.
Belongs at the bottom of a disused coal mine in one of those desperately impoverished West Virginia townships that advertise for people to send them their nuclear waste.	A cult picture that's completely comfortable in its own skin.	It's a hyper-violent, self-conscious throwback, with the sickly plastic aroma of a tape that's been gathering dust in the corner of a video store since 1984.	There's nothing here that you haven't seen before in Lloyd Kaufman's Troma pictures and the grindhouse films of the '70s, save for perhaps better production values and an impressively grizzled Rutger Hauer.	It stomps over any notions of good taste and credibility after roughly five minutes.	It certainly isn't subtle -- or even terribly smart -- but as a gleefully gory homage to low-budget exploitation thrillers, Hobo with a Shotgun packs plenty of firepower.
Considering how much of the film consists of a single group of people becoming increasingly unhinged in a suburban living room, it's impressive how effectively Byrkit manages to suggest multiple realities and ominous other worlds.	A mild form of Lynchian terror is unleashed. It's also rather funny.	At its unstable core, it's about our inner fears of fracturing--splitting into strange selves or unstable identities. Toys cleverly with its cast's generic-ness. An inspired riff on stuck-here-together horror; not a locked-room but unlocked-house mystery.	Coherence is the most convoluted shaggy dog story you'll have heard in quite some time - a shaggy Schrodinger's cat.	Flighty but fun romp in a gravitation field built for eight.	A case study in less-is-more filmmaking, Coherence serves as a compelling low-budget calling card for debuting writer-director James Ward Byrkit.
The shape of this thing is warped. It's a four-character play masquerading as a movie.	LaBute returns to familiar territory (albeit with a gender twist) that would have been best left unvisited.	Instead of characters, LaBute seems to have created lab rats, those who chew and those who get chewed up as they race through the movie's artificial maze.	The Shape of Things is another hard-hitting drama by Neil LaBute exploring the power plays between the sexes and the clash between art and morality.	An amazing piece of writing and one that will provoke laughs, discussion and anger.	LaBute returns to his earlier themes of cruelty in relationships, and the results hit hard.
Solid performances and Soderbergh's sense of human nature and cinematic tension are what hold the Sex, Lies, and Videotape together.	Soderbergh brings a bracing edge of humor to his probingly analytical drama.	Being a little shocking shouldn't be enough to earn you critical applause.	By all means, an interesting ninety minutes, just not a great ninety.	..not nearly as entertaining as it should be.	In his feature directorial debut, Steven Soderbergh demonstrates a mastery of his craft well beyond his years, pulling together an outstanding cast and an intelligent script for a nuanced, mature film about neurosis and human sexuality.
There's a sweetness about it that wins you over.	It's stupid, dull and toothless, and a classic example of why the next generation is increasingly staying away from the movie theaters. Is this all Hollywood thinks of them?	Fails to make the most of its source material by trimming Shakespeare's plot and squeezing it into a vacuous high school comedy.	It leaves viewers wanting more -- if not more Bard, then at least more of its hyperkinetic, unabashed young star.	Amanda Bynes makes the movie with her goofy awkwardness... and it helps that the supporting characters are fun.	Shakespeare's wit gets lost in translation with She's the Man's broad slapstick, predictable jokes, and unconvincing plotline.
Throughout "Girlhood" the malignant energy that results from having a scary home life never entirely dissipates. Yet the story allows for a full array of emotional peaks and valleys.	We feel for [Vic], deeply, and hope that her final, ambiguous act is one of hope.	Sciamma's touch is lighter and more nuanced in Girlhood, which refuses to pin any of its characters down, even in their vacillations.	Girlhood is a blast of oxygen to the coming-of-age genre, with bold direction and a sublime turn from actor Karidja Touré.	Sciamma held open casting for the non-professionals who play this out in near-exclusively black Parisian suburban estates. And what discoveries they prove to be ...	Powerfully acted and smartly scripted, Girlhood offers a fresh perspective on familiar cinematic territory.
The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof.	The turtles' perpetual wisecracks are as forced and overdone as the notorious Mr. Freeze puns of Batman and Robin, but I probably would have loved this movie unconditionally when I was 10.	As a piece of film design, the movie is first-rate; on sheer aesthetics alone, it rivals Triumph of the Will for astonishments.	The plot's all over the place, but director Kevin Munroe keeps it at a hare's pace. The sharp graphics impress too. It's nothing to cow about, but it does, more or less, fill its shell.	Younger viewers might be able to make sense its overly-complex plot - but I fear that everyone else, alas, will soon be suffering from a case of shell shock.	TMNT's art direction is splendid, but the plot is non-existent and the dialogue lacks the irony and goofy wit of the earlier TMNT movies.
It's always presumptuous to suggest that a filmmaker doesn't realize where her narrative's attention should be directed, yet it's hard not to wonder if writer/director Anna Muyleart picked the right protagonist.	The entire cast is first-rate, but the movie is Case's.	A fierce class conscious comedy symbolically celebrating a bold rebel youth rejecting the reactionary traditions thwarting generations preceding them. And perhaps a new day for Brazil and a long oppressed and recently reinvigorated Latin America as well.	We've seen plenty of stories about the arrival of a mysterious stranger upsetting the order of things. But "The Second Mother," Brazilian writer and director Anna Muylaert's outstanding film, is different.	Character relations are hinted at and even primed for confrontation, but without payoff or meaningful conclusion.	The Second Mother's compelling characters serve an artfully drawn, thought-provoking story that's beautifully brought to life by a talented cast.
Those hankering for something different will find Full Frontal a tasty trifle.	Should've been released as a lowkey DVD.	When improv is done well, it sheds a unique light on the human condition. When it is done adequately, as it is in Full Frontal, it simply makes you long for a good script and pricey production values.	The screenplay by Coleman Hough has an equal mix of humor and humanity as it circles around the busy lives of seven people searching for intimate relationships.	If Ocean's Eleven was a high-priced banquet of popular guys toasting one another's hard-earned coolness in a pointless caper, Full Frontal is the after-party.	An confusing movie made worse by the poor camera work.
A mythic ode to righteous bellicosity. In at least one way, the film is true to the ethos of ancient Greece: It conflates moral excellence and physical beauty (which, in this movie, means being young, white, male, and fresh from the gyms of Brentwood).	The look and feel of this historic battle is perfect for the virtual backgrounds and obscene violence. Again, trust me on the violence.	Snyder, needless to say, is completely on board with Miller's conception of Thermopylae as one- fifth history, four-fifths something that looks cool.	An overwrought, revved-up, and deeply silly symphony of clanging steel and spurting blood.	300 is an erotic spectacle for men (straight and gay apparently) and this demographic should bask in the bombastic grandeur of discourse, domination and decapitations.	A simple-minded but visually exciting experience, full of blood, violence, and ready-made movie quotes.
For all its cinematic weaknesses, I left the theatre weeping. "Now you know how I feel when I see holocaust films," my Jewish husband told me gently as he wiped away my tears.	Muddled, sloppy, and obfuscating.	Forget Grindhouse. September Dawn is the year's first honest-to-goodness exploitation flick.	The workmanlike craftsmanship of Cain's filmmaking almost (but never quite) smooths over the ham-fisted way he conceives the story.	While we should always be suspect of history served up with popcorn, this is a story worth telling	With its jarring editing, dull love story, and silly dialogue, September Dawn turns a horrific historical event into a banal movie.
Makes the erroneous suggestion that a woman can't possibly create a life of beauty and meaning without the patter of little feet.	Constantly warm and sometimes devastatingly real, showing just how hard it can be for a family to replace the early departed.	Ladies: You're going to hell if your popping bubble wrap with male models instead of birthin' babies at home.	The movie possesses all the cloying cuteness and soft-edged drama that we've come to expect from pro's pro Marshall.	It isn't great, but, with Kate Hudson, it's cute enough.	As shallow and formulaic as a sitcom.
Too obviously a tormentor himself, Spade can't pull off the sentimental formula that Adam Sandler frequently works.	Joe Dirt is not a good movie, but it's so strange it's almost worth seeing anyway.	Spade's Joe is the biggest hole in a movie that's full of them.	The movie isn't too good.	This movie is simply dumb and not funny enough to be worth paying money to see.	If you fall within the target audience of Joe Dirt, you may find it funny. Otherwise, the jokes will seem like a tired retread.
The movie, even at 124 minutes, has the densely packed sweep and go-for-it pep of a pop epic.	While Akira's blood splattering is over the top for me, I did enjoy the surreal, and the interesting complicated departure from the often-oversimplified good vs. evil.	A furious spectacle of lush colors and dynamic movement.	Like Snow White before it, Akira was a step change in what animation could show.	[Akira] is a blast and a half, a twisted dystopian parable of violence and rock and roll, Japanese-style. It's Disney on PCP, mean, rotten, psychotic, but incredibly vivid.	Akira is distractingly bloody and violent, but its phenomenal animation and sheer kinetic energy helped set the standard for modern anime.
While it is completely predictable Armored is also efficient and suspenseful.	An underwhelming heist-gone-wrong movie that, inexplicably, has avoided going straight to DVD.	An action flick that gets bogged down with unlikely plot twists. Paul Chambers, CNN.	Isn't clever or inventive enough to seem like a high-stakes game.	Over-familiar and industrial, a factory film made because a recycled script, minimal budget, a location, a grab-bag cast and some armored trucks were available.	This B-grade thriller has a good cast and director but is undone by plot holes and messy conclusion.
Without ever touching on a cliche (except to poke fun at it), Shyamalan skillfully builds the film on several layers -- personal redemption, family drama, community-in-crisis, world on the brink.	For most of its footage, the new thriller proves that director M. Night Shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that Mel Gibson can gasp, shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo.	Shyamalan delivers Old School filmmaking at its best ... but also an ending that doesn't hold any water.	There's plenty here that testifies to Shyamalan's exceptional talent.	Maybe I feel let down because I'd appreciate someone presenting a halfway credible explanation for the crop circles and this does nothing more than to drain away some of their fascination in a commercially successful maneuver to exploit.	With Signs, Shyamalan proves once again an expert at building suspense and giving audiences the chills.
The movie is informed by a rather gaga and, given the historical context, intellectually lazy pacifism, but Rogozhkin's painterly visual flair and his conciliatory humanism ultimately beguile and console.	Handicapped by a slow start, misguided direction and, most damaging, an ill-conceived movement into metaphysical territory in its last 15 minutes.	A bit overextended for its very simple story...but for the most part this is a charming, curiously touching picture.	It's quite a treat.	Rogozhkin makes nearly all of his points with surprising subtlety.	A sweet and amusing comedy.
Pauly Shore's finest hour.	...and introducing Pauly Shore.	This is every bit as insipid as it sounds, but it's also surprisingly innocent and has a most unexpected sweetness.	The real question is whether Dave and Stoney and Link are worthy heirs to Bill and Ted or Wayne and Garth. Not really.	Low-budget quickie is insulting even within its own no-effort parameters.	Encino Man isn't the first unabashedly silly comedy to embrace its stupidity and amass a cult following, but whether or not it works for you will largely be determined by your tolerance for Pauly Shore.
The music's better than the stories.	... a must-watch for fans of punk music, vinyl record wonks, or even those interested ... a visionary entertainment dream.	If you're looking for a 96-minute jolt of joy, look no further than this uplifting, well-made documentary ...	A very good movie about a very bad band!	It could have dug a little deeper, pursued more candid moments to capture on film. But it compensates by recanting the emotionally meaningful story of the Hackney family.	A Band Called Death is not only a fascinating portrait of a pioneering rock group, but also a tribute to family ties and perseverance in the face of hardship.
No one can do that cool running knee drop like Tony Jaa, but he'd better start flexing his smiling muscles more if he wants to be the next Jackie Chan. All the bone crunching makes Steven Seagal look like a restrained kitty.	Jaa's ingratiatingly ridiculous Protector delivers a steady stream of cheap B-movie thrills, plus two positive messages for young people: Be nice to animals, and when in doubt, always aim for the tendons.	As a breathtaking follow-up to 2003's Ong-Bak: Thai Warrior, it's a whole lotta fun.	The Protector isn't a sequel to Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior but it is a thinly disguised retread.	This ludicrous Quentin Tarantino-chosen low-budget movie features choppy editing and an amateurish script, and it switches strangely back and forth between dubbing and subtitles.	Despite some impressive fight scenes, this trimmed-down version of the Thai action pic is an off-putting mix of scant plot, choppy editing, and confusing subtitles and dubbing.
the film doesn't just strain credulity, it viciously rends it into teeny tiny pieces and then dances upon it with wild abandon and maniacal glee	The unimpressive Dark Castle Entertainment track record continues.	If you try hard enough, you might be able to forget that the story doesn't make a lot of sense or provide adequate thrills, although it tries to scare you a couple of times in the cheapest possible way.	Begins as a promisingly creepy thriller but then falls apart.	A B-level thriller with giant plot holes and lazy direction that pretends it's a real movie by casting A-list stars and getting a foreign art-house director to helm it.	Berry's acting talents can't save Gothika from its preposterous plot and bad dialogue.
Yasujiro Ozu was a master film-maker who specialised in middle-class family melodramas known in Japanese as shomin-geki, and this moving story is one of his finest achievements.	Ozu only has to train his camera on a face to uncover a sense of resignation, or longing, or loneliness, and the mood, if you allow it, becomes quite overwhelming.	It ennobles the cinema. It says, yes, a movie can help us make small steps against our imperfections.	This 1953 classic is one of the cinema's most profound and moving studies of married love, ageing and the relations between parents and children. It is flawless and rewards numerous viewings.	Could easily change your life.	Tokyo Story is a Yasujiro Ozu masterpiece whose rewarding complexity has lost none of its power more than half a century on.
If nobility was the measure of quality in documentary films, then dozens of them would be Sundance prize-winners -- just like this extra-virtuous, dramatically undernourished portrait of the agony of exile.	Satisfying enough to demonstrate that some stories deserve to be told more than once.	Three Sudanese men struggle to adjust to life in the United States -- from their perspective, a very strange place -- in this affecting and well-made culture-shock documentary.	God Grew Tired of Us cares more about hope than it does full disclosure, and it goes about that agenda pretty expertly. It's emotional and smart.	God may be tired of us, but if these men's lives are any indication, he certainly isn't finished with us.	Not just a powerful telling of the journey of exiled Sudanese boys, God Grew Tired of Us is also a poignant account of the determination of the human spirit.
Moore makes the stories of injustice he's gathered the real meat of his film; and as he tells them, he shows a continued disillusionment at the depths the powerful are willing to go to against one's fellow man just for the sake of more wealth.	Both thought-provoking and entertaining.	There are moments in Capitalism when you're reminded of Moore's talent for shrieking truth to power. The rest of the film, however, only proves that his quixotic preachiness can make even a worthy cause feel occasionally bankrupt.	Proving that demagoguery can come as easily from the left as from the right, Michael Moore has produced a jerry-rigged jeremiad about free enterprise that hands up some very legitimate indictments, without really making a case.	Whatever it lacks in a red-target focal point, it's still Moore doing what he does best: chipping away the layers of fraud that have calcified America, hoping to inspire others to storm the streets and question authority.	Love him or hate him, Capitalism captures Michael Moore in his muckraking element -- with all the Moore-centric showmanship that entails.
A loving and lurid pastiche of the spaghetti westerns that were themselves lurid pastiches of classic Hollywood cowboy pictures.	...everything that was supposed to enliven the picture perfect images just seemed to drag them down with lame dialogue and clichéd action.	The chaotic elements never really coalesce into a sensible whole beyond the idea that this is what, at that moment, Miike thought would be really cool...the film is cluttered and not very fun.	An homage to the concept of "more is less."	[A] superheated stir-fry.	Inventive and off-kilter, the newest feast from J-Horror director Takashi Miike is super-sensory, self-referential and somewhat excessive.
a poisonous play of parentage	Huppert, for her part, is magnificent, an enigmatic echo of her twisted musician in Michael Haneke's horribly grandiloquent The Piano Teacher.	Claude Chabrol has here a thriller without thrills, but that's okay.	Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone. You leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt, but no new friends.	Chabrol brilliantly conjures menace from the everyday and familiar.	Boasting a masterful performance by Huppert, Merci Pour Le Chocolat is a suspenseful psychological thriller.
People have asked me if The Keeping Room is a feminist western... I just feel it's a great western that stars three women.	A pretty, tense and well-acted film, but it too easily forgives itself for glossing over what could otherwise have been incredibly intricate and multifaceted characters and situations.	Director Daniel Barber uses a bleak and unresolved portion of American history to justify indulging typical genre-film nihilism.	I'm positive there's an audience for an Old West tale about fierce, independent women. I'm equally positive it can be done better.	Never for a moment does Marling, Steinfeld or Otaru let a hint of modernity affect their speech or performance.	Aided by its spare setting and committed performances, The Keeping Room is just fascinatingly off-kilter enough to overcome its frustrating stumbles.
Suspenseful movie based on a true incident; Ben Affleck's stock rises as an actor and director.	Just fantastic all around the board. Affleck paints a great picture, and I'll tell you what. 1980's Iran? Scarier than Jurassic Park. One of the best of the year, 4.5/5 Schmoes. Will be nominated for Best Picture.	Extraordinarily suspenseful, extremely well-told and effortless in its complex tonal balance, Argo is a captivating and thoughtful true-life drama that boasts a story so astonishing, it could only be told in the movies.	Argo is a terrific movie that pulls off the rare trifecta of being smart, funny and exciting.	With Argo, Affleck emerges into the front rank of contemporary American directors.	Tense, exciting, and often darkly comic, Argo recreates a historical event with vivid attention to detail and finely wrought characters.
Sweet, heartfelt, and confidently told; A terrific debut for all involved.	A wonderfully refreshing slice of urban ghetto life.	A beguiling coming-of-age story set in New York during one sweltering summer when teenagers are seesawing between bravado and timid vulnerability in the face of sex's mysteries.	Captures the awkwardness of adolescence like few films have.	It's a sweet movie told with unswerving honesty, but it never quite manages to be compelling.	A coming-of-age tale marked by its authenticity.
The film works well despite its predictability, perhaps because of it.	Based on the French film, Three Men and a Cradle, this is acceptable comedy, but cinema it is not.	It's thoroughly enjoyable family fare.	The balance of the film is devoted to milking as much humor as possible out of the situation of three urbane young men trying to play nursemaid with nary a clue of what they're doing.	For a better time, however, rent Serreau`s original film at the video store.	The American remake of the popular French comedy mostly works a charm under the combined talents of the three leads, who play nicely against type -- although forced plot elements and sentimentality at times dampen the fun.
I don't care who you are, where you're from or what your cinematic tastes may have been up to this point, you've never seen anything like it.	Nothing short of a triumph.	It's a lovely work.	This is Almodóvar's best film in a long while.	A satisfying emotional journey.	Almodovar weaves together a magnificent tapestry of femininity with an affectionate wink to classics of theater and cinema in this poignant story of love, loss and compassion.
"The Warrior's Way" is a horribly ill-conceived idea that tries to blend Eastern and Western cinema, but all it ends up doing is creating a disaster that's filled to the brim with enough clichés to make your head spin.	Succeeds in cutting out a distinct visual flourish amid a bland cinematic landscape.	Your first clue that you're about to see the worst flick of 2010 is the TWO Nicholas Cage trailers you endure before the movie even starts.	While the film claims dazzling visuals, Lee fails to deliver the type of never-before-seen martial arts fights fans demand.	It's stupid in a way you won't really hate, provided you're already in the mood for a terrible rehash of cliches from a hundred other martial arts movies and Westerns.	Perfectly, thoroughly divisive, The Warrior's Way will either be delightful or unbearable, depending on your tolerance for surreal, shamelessly over the top collisions of eastern and western clichés.
Boy is the feel-good film of the year. This boy's life is a hilarious and bewitching reminder of what it's like to be young.	Boy is one of the most successful films of all time in its home country and it's not hard to see why. It's about that moment every child experiences when they realise their dad or mum is not a hero but just a human being.	A cross between The 400 Blows and Slumdog Millionaire.	Humor, obscenity, drugs, sadness and an uncommon take lift 'Boy' above its advertised 'coming-of-age tale about heroes, magic and Michael Jackson.'	Boy needn't be pop-culturally fluent to be relatable; believable human characterizations would have sufficed.	Boy possesses the offbeat charm associated with New Zealand film but is also fully capable of drawing the viewer in emotionally.
Works best as an homage.	What comes through more than anything is Dominique's resolve -- and the ways that Haitian leaders tried to stop him.	A valuable and deeply haunting portrait of a social activist who lived and died for the highest ideals.	We are left with vivid images of Dominique, whose desire to change his country, despite formidable intimidation, is an inspiration to any supporter of democracy.	The film's origins as a side project are obvious in its amateur production values, with framing that's constantly having to adjust and a picture that's not always in focus.	A well-made, emotionally engaging documentary about Haitian social activist Jean Dominique.
An impressive debut; it looks and feels like life.	Pays close and respectful attention to its characters, allowing them time to develop and deepen.	It's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places, but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety.	Watching Tully reminded me of a time when calling a movie 'little' was a compliment, a way of saying a director had found ways to locate his movie in a world that seemed entirely real.	Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters, its sensitive acting, its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham.	A beautifully acted, quietly moving little film.
Mr. Wiseman has made his share of grim documentaries in which people are processed and oppressed by bureaucracy. "At Berkeley" is not one.	Hypnotically edited and intellectually stimulating, At Berkeley doesn't feel a minute too long, even at four hours.	The fragility of public education looms in the background of every scene, but, as always, Wiseman proves a wizard at shutting up and listening and learning.	At the venerable age of 84, documentary maven Wiseman hasn't lost his touch.	There's a fair amount of redundancy here.	Its generous running time will test less forbearing viewers' patience, but for filmgoers seeking more of director Frederick Wiseman's observant brand of documentary, At Berkeley satisfies.
There is a remarkable story to be told of outlaws carving out their own slice of the industry with scant regard for decorum, personal safety or narrative coherence.	... a smartly made look at an otherwise neglected aspect of film history and culture, packed with colorful stories, witty observations, punky attitude and real history...	...an audacious, in-your-face documentary...	What's nice about a movie like this is that it gives you a sampling of this genre without making you sit down and watch hours and hours of movies.	Oddball horror flicks, sexploitation romps, car-chase extravaganzas - the clips burn throughout this film with a tone as giddy as its subject.	A raucous, fast-paced celebration of the Ozploitation films that came out of Australia in the 1970s and 1980s.
a movie that has periods of good in between alot of meaninglessness and unimportance.	The Last Kiss isn't terrible, but if you're strapped for a night out, it can easily wait till DVD. Better yet, it may be time to revisit Diner.	... Paul Haggis has turned the Italian romantic comedy L'Ultimo Bacio (2001) into something smarter, funnier, and more penetrating.	Bring a barf bag and a razor blade, because you'll need one or both by the time you're done with this.	... a smart, witty, sexy take on the perils of becoming an adult.	You'll either find the The Last Kiss to be a phony bore or a refreshing take about young 20-somethings at the crossroads between their carefree lifestyle and responsibility. Zach Braff and the rest of the appealing cast make the case for the latter.
Steve Coogan is the whole show in Hamlet 2, and while director and co-writer Andrew Fleming is strictly rudimentary in terms of technique and style, his British star pockets every available laugh plus a few unavailable ones.	Hamlet 2 star Steve Coogan told HollywoodChicago.com: "It did make me nervous to play Jesus. I wondered whether the director was just trying to be provocative to annoy Christians or if it was just funny."	Hamlet 2 is deliriously profane and marvelously hilarious, an outrageous satire that uses absurdist humor to ask an age old question: what happens when you love something but are not remotely good at it?	Hamlet 2 is a tour-de-force from Coogan (the director in Tropic Thunder), who's never been more wonderfully, wildly unhinged.	[S]tands as an act of comedic alchemy -- a slick, occasionally inspired Dangerous Minds satire that Coogan forcibly drags to a state of near brilliance.	The script's biting premise and Steve Coogan's endearing, off-the-handle performance make Hamlet 2 an hysterical -- if slightly painful -- ride.
It takes a particularly weird kind of sincerity to end a movie that has been for its entire running time an exploration of surfaces... with its most sublime and humane gesture.	Stylistically, Blade Runner is the Citizen Kane of sci-fi movies.	Open the champagne: Blade Runner is finally just the way Ridley Scott wanted it. And it only took 25 years.	It's an excellent film, although a tad flawed.	Scott's film may keep us at arm's length, but it holds us, too.	Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.
A neo-screwball comedy that pits dapper yet dizzy George Clooney against the sinuously slinky Catherine Zeta-Jones, Intolerable Cruelty serves up a diverting, sporadically devastating satire on the battle of the sexes.	One of the most inspired, scathing, and downright side-splitting comedies to come out of Hollywood this year.	Stands up fine as Friday-night fun and if the aim were to produce a slice of escapist entertainment then it can be said to succeed, if not excel.	Both Clooney and Zeta-Jones are given simple lines that they deliver so deliciously that they set some sort of gold standard.	Clooney is as watchable here as Cary Grant or Clark Gable in their prime, and Zeta-Jones exudes a glamour-gal sexiness reminiscent of Rita Hayworth.	Though more mainstream than other Coen films, there are still funny oddball touches, and Clooney and Zeta-Jones sizzle like old-time movie stars.
Sitting through "A Good Old Fashioned Orgy" is like being monopolized by the most irritating person at a really boring party.	It hedges its bets in the big climax--so to speak.	The movie keeps its balance better than its leering title might suggest.	These immature, fairly pitiable protagonists go about their absurd project in all the wrong ways. But you just keep rooting for them.	The film can't escape the feeling that it's not even interested in its own premise or that its jokey, stunted characters are closer to sad than funny.	Its titillating title promises ribald laughs, but the lazily written, indifferently acted, and only sporadically funny A Good Old Fashioned Orgy fails to consummate.
Less a crime film than a study in levels of obsession, Laura is one of those classic works that leave their subject matter behind and live on the strength of their seductive style.	The materials of a B-grade crime potboiler are redeemed by Waldo Lydecker, walking through every scene as if afraid to step in something.	The story is a good whodunnit, although it probably isn't half as clever as a mystery as it is a character study.	At times, the plotting takes leaps that the film's 87-minute run doesn't adequately support; but overall this is a gem.	Classic in the true sense with great theme music to boot.	A psychologically complex portrait of obsession, Laura is also a deliciously well-crafted murder mystery.
Awkwardly paced and muddled.	You should see this movie for the action and gunfights... oh, and for Olga Kurylenko.	Hitman is inspired by a video game. That of course carries all sorts of baggage.	French director Xavier Gens keeps the action riveting and spectacular.	merikes aksiomnimoneytes skines, ataktos petamenes s' ena tsoybali hamilon prosdokion	Hitman features the unfortunate combination of excessive violence, incoherent plot, and inane dialogue.
It's an intermittently powerful but deeply flawed film.	Tyrese may be the marquee name, but Rhames is a man among Baby Boys.	Fans of Singleton's early work may be disappointed by the shrill, pointless exchanges, directionless nature and tidy conclusions of Baby Boy.	Tells it like it is with just a glimmer of how it ought to be.	[Singleton] He means for this to be r,38p,11p revelatory, but it is instead exhausting.	Preachy and repetitive in parts, Baby Boy still manages to exude authenticity, thanks to its competent cast.
No one looks at the world quite like Kaurismäki, and his deadpan sentimentality is worth discovery. This is a good place to start.	Such a heart-warming tale in any other hands could so easily become schmaltzy (a Spielberg remake would be awful), but the deadpan delivery and endless idiosyncrasies counterbalance this tendency.	o Kaurismäki potizei thn istoria toy me ton naif soyrealismo kai to idiotypo xioymor poy exeis mathei na perimeneis ap' tis tainies toy, enw thn idia wra se pairnei ap' to xeraki kai se taksideyei sthn istoria toy kinhmatografoy	Written and directed by Finland's Aki Kaurismäki, this warmly engaging film is an understated pleasure about a surprisingly resourceful underdog.	Aki Kaurismaki carves out another comically enchanted movie oasis from the real world where people can rise to the occasion and do the right things.	Aki Kaurismäki's deadpan wit hits a graceful note with Le Havre, a comedy/drama that's sweet, sad, and uplifting in equal measure.
Thirst is a brilliant and gruesome work of cinematic invention as well as a passionate and painful human love story.	Something must have bored writer/director Chan-wook Park, because the second and third acts of Thirst play like scenes out of a totally different and much more incoherent film.	Unleashing torrents of stylishly shot blood-letting he mocks the anaemic approach to the carnal undercurrents of vampire lore favoured by western cinema.	Just when we've set our brains on ponder, the picture muddies all hope of contemplation with flashes of the fearlessly eccentric imagery for which Park has become famous, and some of the slurpiest sex scenes to be found in any recent R-rated movie.	Park directs with his usual eye-catching skill and attention to gruesome detail, and creates a story with strong emotional resonance.	The stylish Thirst packs plenty of bloody thrills to satisfy fans of both vampire films and director Chan Wook Park.
It's easy to roll one's eyes at Dolphin Tale, which is heavy on swelling music and how children - aw, shucks! - can teach adults a thing or two about holding on to hope.	The cast is delightful, the story corny without being cloyingly high-fructose, the direction first-rate.	DOLPHIN TALE is the perfect end of summer event for the whole family.	Heartwarming tale is sweet, inspiring for kids and tweens.	It's disappointing to find the movie using the dolphin to fuel tepid stories of domestic strife when the star of the show is clearly Winter and her incredible journey of medical treatment.	Wisely dialing down the schmaltz, Dolphin Tale is earnest, sweet, and well-told, a rare family film that both kids and parents can enjoy.
scintillating and sly, but never self-congratulatory. It's agenda is of a higher nature, one that gently prods us into realizing that reality is a fluid thing	Damon's too-tame-to-tantalize narrative voiceover throughout is monotonous, in an absurdist scam-within-a scam eavesdropper noir that needed more dramatic clout. And less lighthearted humor and a darker thrust, in keeping with this twisted subject matter.	Soderbergh takes satirical-ironic approach to this timely and entertaining tale of corporate greed and conspiracy, which benefits from Matt Damon's charismatic performance.	Damon's portrayal is complicated, amusing and somewhat heartbreaking.	After a parodic run-up, the film betrays a certain respect for this odd little creation.	A charismatic turn by star Matt Damon and a consistently ironic tone boost this quietly funny satire about a corporate whistle-blower.
As this entertaining recording of his one-man show reveals, Reilly was a natural raconteur.	This charming, bittersweet 90-minute monologue consists of the actor telling tales of his childhood and early years, when he was an ugly duckling from an uglier family.	Even abridged, The Life Of Reilly is spellbinding.	...he's far more candid recalling his grand delusions in a school play than he is when he gets to Broadway and Hollywood.	This is a story about all wide-eyed dreamers as much as it is about him: When Reilly reads off the roster of his classmates in a New York acting class for the dirt-poor, it's a simple act that's hugely inspiring.	The Life of Reilly is a humorous and endearing look at the late comedian.
Jason Reitman and Charlize Theron create a realistic insight into what happens to the popular high school student who can't adjust to the real world in Young Adult.	The really pretty Theron captures that state of really ugly inner childishness (articulated so sharply by Cody) with such precision, it makes you want to hear stories of her own high school experience.	Theron nails the specifics of her character, all the distress signals, from the nervous hair-pulling to the relentless default sarcasm.	Ms. Theron, a true beauty and one of the screen's most exquisite actors, keeps the film airborne even when it seems dangerously earthbound. She's a one-woman emergency rescue squad.	Cody and Reitman were once two of the most promising talents in the filmmaking business, but Young Adult erases any of their past success from memory. I truly hope for a return to form soon because YA is a real downer.	Despite its somewhat dour approach, Young Adult is a funny and ultimately powerful no-holds-barred examination of prolonged adolescence, thanks largely to a convincing performance by Charlize Theron.
The acting from everyone is great, with Thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance, and Hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway.	It predicts the way the world would change in 2001--and how our films would reflect that change.	A well-directed, visually stunning morally complex tale. There is no gene for a good movie.	A spare, intelligent thriller from first-time writer-director Andrew Niccol.	This is a thought-provoking film, an effective wake-up call to those who glorify science.	Intelligent and scientifically provocative, Gattaca is an absorbing sci fi drama that poses important interesting ethical questions about the nature of science.
You feel like you're tromping through the desert sand yourself, never sure what's over the next dune, and because the acting in the film is so low-key and the narrative so slight, the events on screen can have a detached feel.	Khandahar delivers pretty much what one would expect from one of the masters of the New Iranian Cinema -- deceptive simplicity and sheer poetry.	Although it's unevenly acted, Kandahar is a devastating film.	Moving.	Although occasionally its narration is a bit halting and awkward, it's a lyrical, stunning picture of the ravages of war.	Eerily timely, Kandahar offers haunting images of a bleak land.
He Got Game is great for looking at a sense of time and place and at the web of relationships that describes the community in the film, reasons enough for setting this film above many others.	Spike Lee tries to make two movies here--and give him points for almost pulling it off.	[Lee] gets a charming performance from Allen, who, in his acting debut, occupies his pedestal with grace and diffidence.	Washington's Jake Shuttlesworth looks tough and hard, an odd but refreshing turn for an actor long associated with handsomely heroic roles.	The most effective moments are small, when Lee lets his fine actors do their work without all the (movie) business.	Though not without its flaws, He Got Game finds Spike Lee at or near the top of his late-period game, combining trenchant commentary with his signature visuals and a strong performance from Denzel Washington.
One of a half dozen Christmas movie classics.	The acting is superb all around. The script is lovely, good spirited and perfect viewing for the Christmas season.	The original (and best) version of the cockle-warming tale of a man who claims to be the real-life Santa Claus.	The acting is superb all around. The script is lovely, good spirited and perfect viewing for the Christmas season.	A surefire, brightly cynical bit of whimsy.	Irrefutable proof that gentle sentimentalism can be the chief ingredient in a wonderful film, Miracle on 34th Street delivers a warm holiday message without resorting to treacle.
Planes, Trains and Automobiles showed that Hughes wasn't in fact some man-child searching for the reasons for his adulthood discontentment.	This slapstick comedy -- with Steve Martin playing the fussy straight man -- should never have worked, but it does, and well enough to earn a place as a holiday classic.	Producer-director-writer Hughes infuses his film with an appealing sense of sentiment and humanity -- not to mention many hilarious scenes.	certainly funny, but it is also a moving story that anyone who has ever recognized his or her own shortcomings will understand	The movies that last, the ones we return to, don't always have lofty themes or Byzantine complexities. Sometimes they last because they are arrows straight to the heart.	Thanks to the impeccable chemistry between Steve Martin and John Candy, as well as a deft mix of humor and heart, Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a hilarious, heartfelt holiday classic.
There's virtually no one in Zion over the age of 30 except for esteemed character actor Anthony Zerbe, and he's so far past 30 he couldn't find his way back if 30 left a trail of Scotch Highballs.	Smart, sexy, and action-rammed.	Sure to entertain, philosophize, and leave you hanging for the final chapter.	More special effects. More fight sequences. More chases. More stunts. More neo-philosophical babble. But more, in this case, adds up to less.	The encoded bloom is off the digital rose in The Matrix Reloaded. [Blu-ray]	Though its heady themes are a departure from its predecessor, The Matrix Reloaded is a worthy sequel packed with popcorn-friendly thrills.
Soulless retreads without an ounce of passion or creativity that no amount of colorful surface details can quite cover up.	...fights battles that were won decades ago... but avoids pat resolutions...	[Y]ou know I know a lot of people who said this thing looks a lot like Dead Poets Society, well, so what? ... Dead Poets Society was a really good film and this is a good film as well.	if it doesn't have any profound insights to share, at least director Mike Newell's film doesn't traffic in suffocating sentimentality or 'those were the days' daydreaminess.	as challenging, surprising, and intriguing as a bowl of lukewarm cream of wheat	Though Mona Lisa Smile espouses the value of breaking barriers, the movie itself is predictable and safe.
The film is a bit slow paced, but it derives such a great joy from its subject matter that you can't help but walk out craving a great meal.	A small movie -- and that's its subtle charm.	Although hurt by uneven pacing and inconsistent writing, the film handles itself with style, wit and flavor.	Delicious adult fare sure to leave you hungry.	Lovingly crafted by Stanley Tucci, it is a tribute to food, to all things American, to immigrants trying to make it, and to the love between brothers.	The performances in Big Night are wonderful, and the food looks delicious.
Vincent Cassel renders a towering performance as the legendary killer and media darling in the French crime gangster film, an epic of ambitious proportions.	By trying to cover everything the picture manages to make nothing--especially Mesrine himself--seem significant or interesting.	To play this larger-than-life character, Richet casts a similarly magnetic performer, Vincent Cassel, an actor who combines the explosive intensity of a young Pacino with the slow-burning restraint of a young DeNiro.	The film offers a close, nostalgic approximation of classical Hollywood gangster cinema.	Killer Instinct is generally fast-paced but the need to cram about 15 years of Mesrine's life into less than two hours results in uneven patches.	It's undeniably uneven, but Vincent Cassel's electrifying performance makes Mesrine: Killer Instinct a gangster biopic worth seeking out.
The drama is low-key, the theme of short term pain versus long term gain is intriguingly explored, it may not have the gung-ho action that some audiences demand but it is a solid well-made thriller.	an interesting yarn, but while watching it I was unable to shake that it was so ... freaking ... slow.	Doesn't do too much wrong, yet struggles with the weight of expectation.	The cat-and-mouse games, while entertaining, feel familiar. What elevates the movie is Hoffman's performance as a man pouring his soul into the only work he knows.	The movie is good, solid le Carre. It's chilly yet humane, and human-scaled ...	Smart, subtle, and steadily absorbing, A Most Wanted Man proves once again that John le Carre books make for sharp, thoughtful thrillers.
One of the many pleasures of the Norwegian director André Ovredal's clever and engaging mock documentary "Trollhunter" is the way it plays with the idea of the supernatural rule book.	With impressive technical credits, stunning fjord and forest locations and a winking ownership of its own absurdity, "Trollhunter" manages to be at once spooky, satirical and endearing.	TrollHunter has its scary moments, particularly toward the end of the film, but it's also hilarious in a dry, Scandinavian sort of way.	A leisurely, shambling, deadpan movie about a man who finds trolls and kills them. That's enough.	Jespersen is a veteran comedian and he uses all his gravitas and dry wit to make us care about a lonely man on the verge of a crisis of faith.	Trollhunter is a mockumentary with an appropriate level of creeping dread, but one that also benefits from generous helpings of dry wit.
The reason to watch, and to watch on as big a screen as possible, is the footage of the breathtaking climbing action.	Much as we value artistic distance, it's not like Chin could strap Werner Herzog to his back on his ascent to the heavens.	This is one of the most outstanding documentaries of the year.	Practitioners of climbing--and enthusiasts who prefer to experience such extreme activity from the comfort of their armchairs--will find this film a treat.	How one responds to Meru will largely depend on whether its three subjects come across as heroically courageous or suicidally reckless.	Gripping visually as well as narratively, Meru is the rare documentary that proves thought-provoking while offering thrilling wide-screen vistas.
Although the surroundings may be unfamiliar, make no mistake: We've been here before with Woody Allen.	Allen uses the change of scenery to his advantage.	This lean, mean, surprisingly sultry thriller about fate, luck, greed and guilt is Woody Allen's best since "Mighty Aphrodite." Plus, it boasts a vintage-Allen metaphor of a bobbling tennis ball that, in a great gotcha scene, becomes a damning motif.	The hype is technically true: Match Point is Woody Allen's best movie in years. But only because he's already had practice making it.	Maybe it's just luck that the women in Allen's latest film -- irrational, demanding, and voluble -- come to represent the protagonist's lack of "meaning."	Woody Allen's sharpest film in years, Match Point is a taut, philosophical thriller about class and infidelity.
It's not Godard's best film, but it is one of cinema's most interesting looks at itself, masquerading as a love story gone awry.	Instinctively self-reflexive, "Contempt" ("Le Mepris") is one of Jean-Luc Goddard's brightest achievements	Bardot's icy, almost lifeless cipher of a blond is Godard's metaphor for cinema: a big, plastic bit of good-looking nothing.	Godard's self-reflexive meditation about love, marriage, and filmmaking is a masterpiece, which among other things, proves that sex symbol Brigitte Bardot could act.	A fine film about the pressures of filmmaking. And it's an even finer film about the tragedy of marital dissolution.	This powerful work of essential cinema joins "meta" with "physique," casting Brigite Bardot and director Godard's inspiration Fritz Lang.
The movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining.	Michael Mann has come a long way since his days supervising Miami Vice on TV, and it's fascinating to watch a filmmaker of such extraordinary ability working a slice of pure cheesecake like this.	Even as a strictly superficial survey of Michael Mann's world, there's still an electric charge from all its nabs, jumps and gets. It's not Mann's usual poetry of pushing the existential envelope, but it's a skillful action film.	Miami Vice delivers the thrills, atmosphere and romance it promises, but it doesn't resonate like major Mann.	What a boring movie.	Miami Vice is beautifully shot but the lead characters lack the charisma of their TV series counterparts, and the underdeveloped story is well below the standards of Michael Mann's better films.
Although it's difficult to imagine writing as a dramatic activity, Connery makes it seem so in the challenging role of a reclusive novelist mentoring a gifted student.	A rewarding exploration of the knotty and often contentious relationship between teacher and protege. Its chief pleasure is the master class in the art of acting delivered by Sean Connery.	There's plenty here that feels real and true.	Warm and likable -- and, during the holidays, warm and likable is often what moviegoers want.	La cinta es disfrutable aunque uno no sea de color, buen tirador de tiros libres, o buen escritor.	Despite the predictability of its plot and its similarity to Good Will Hunting, Finding Forrester has an honest, solid feel to it and good rapport between Connery and Brown.
Merece crйditos por se preocupar em usar sua embalagem de "longa de aзгo" para abordar um assunto sйrio que deveria ganhar mais destaque na imprensa mundial.	What really strikes is the steel meld between bone-jarring action scenes and the all-too-believable political chicanery from the sort of people who will be on nodding terms with Halliburton in the form of Kinnear's sharp-suited ultra-rotter.	Frustratingly uneven...	Green Zone approaches every human activity as if preparing to defibrillate.	...a stiff, uneven Iraq War actioner that's more anti-invasion wish fulfillment than ideas-driven drama.	Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass return to the propulsive action and visceral editing of the Bourne films -- but a cliched script and stock characters keep those methods from being as effective this time around.
Sure, the film's reality may be saccharine, but for a non-computer animated, non-3D kid's film, we'll take it.	Joey King will bounce back.	It's something that you would not be unhappy seeing on television, [but] there's nothing that calls it for you to go see it on the big-screen.	Successful on its own terms in its refusal to talk down to its pre-teen audience and through the massive future star-power of its talented young stars.	The resulting story is a jumble, and there are too many side characters, but golly if it isn't pretty darned infectious.	If Ramona and Beezus fails to capture the essence of its classic source material, it's sunny, sweet, and wholesome.
Increased awareness is only the beginning.	It is hard to not respect anything that asks us to respect the stories of the dead, and asks us how we might help the living.	Where Hirsh is trying to represent how terrible bullying can be, he shoots himself in the foot by going after the most extreme and stereotypical cases.	An intense look at bullying from the perspective of the victims.	It's eye-opening to look at the "bad" schools but I was also hoping to see the "good" schools and learn about the initiatives that they've taken to address the issue.	Hard-hitting and gracefully filmed, Bully powerfully delivers an essential message to an audience that may not be able to see it.
True Grit is indeed a true Coen brothers movie.	What you don't get from the commercials is how wonderfully funny it is. Of course, you expect something like this from the Coen brothers. In True Grit, they deliver what they normally do, which is a fantastic mix of humor and, you'll forgive me here, grit.	Its great strength is its contrast between a brash young innocent and a seen-it-all, laid-back older man.	The versatile Joel and Ethan Coen take a major step toward mainstream (and more conventional) cinema in their enjoyable, well acted remake of the 1969 classic Western, for which John Wayne won an Oscar and Jeff Bridges should get a nomination.	A marvelous film. The highlight is the performance of Hailee Steinfeld as the young heroine, Mattie Ross, but also boasting strong turns by Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon.	Girded by strong performances from Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, and lifted by some of the Coens' most finely tuned, unaffected work, True Grit is a worthy companion to the Charles Portis book.
The film concludes with plenty of expectation for a sequel - indeed, producer Jerry Bruckheimer has said a screenplay is in the works for a fifth Pirates. But it might be time for this franchise to furl its sails.	On Stranger Tides is not an exceptional summer popcorn movie, but it provides acceptable summer fun.	Severely suffers from simplicity, trying to blanket the brain cramps experienced by those who chose not to keep up with many of the unappreciated intricacies of its predecessors.	At least On Stranger Tides aspires towards coherence.	As usual, when the filmmakers get in over their heads it's Depp who must wade in and get them out of trouble.	It's shorter and leaner than the previous sequel, but this Pirates runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non-stop barrage of noisy action sequences.
Nothing more than a bigger, louder, glossier, possibly even sillier film than those cheesy Italian cheapies with U.S. titles like Mole Men Vs. the Son of Hercules.	This isn't the story of powerful heroes but of powerfully flawed people.	Wolfgang Peterson's Troy naturally subscribes to a no-shirt rule for ancient Greece's most prominent heroes.	The film is good for many of its concepts but fails to really capture the narratives desperation.	Sweeping and dramatic, Troy is an epic in the truest sense, and short of Mel Gibson’s Passion, it is the best film to hit theaters this year.	A brawny, entertaining spectacle, but lacking emotional resonance.
One of Eastwood's finest outings to date, an elegiac western that ironically undermines the conventions of the genre, only to deliver a finale as legendary as the shootout at the O.K. Corral.	Along with Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, as authentic a depiction of a Wild West town as you are likely to find.	This dark, melancholic film is a reminder-never more necessary than now-of what the American cinema is capable of, in the way of expressing a mature, morally complex and challenging view of the world.	Eastwood's best film -- a compelling study of the shame and guilt that attends violence, of the rule of the mighty over the weak and of courage and cowardice.	High Noon it isn't; it's more like the darkest midnight of the American soul.	As both director and star, Clint Eastwood strips away decades of Hollywood varnish applied to the Wild West, and emerges with a series of harshly eloquent statements about the nature of violence.
It's too long and too sappy, but it manages to be fine entertainment nonetheless.	It tells such a good story in such a cleverly old-fashioned way that you go along with practically everything.	In a summer film season filled with plotless star vehicles and exploding sequels, Seabiscuit easily rides to the front of the pack.	A movie that has as much heart as Seabiscuit himself.	If you've been waiting all summer for a story that doesn't rely on explosions, car chases and computer-generated effects, here it is.	A life-affirming, if saccharine, epic treatment of a spirit-lifting figure in sports history.
Despite a bit too much whimsy in the first half, this account of Philippe Petit's remarkable wire-walk between New York's Twin Towers is a dazzling visual experience.	There are some films you see simply for their images, and The Walk just might be one of them.	It's extremely antic for the most part, covering a lack of real story with a lot of distracting quirk. Yet when Petit's foot slips out onto a wire thousands of metres from the ground, it's quietly mesmerising.	Damn if the sublime last act doesn't wash away most of the movie's early and clumsy aftertaste.	You should see it on the biggest screen you can find, and be patient until you get to the reason why.	The Walk attempts a tricky balancing act between thrilling visuals and fact-based drama -- and like its wire-walking protagonist, pulls it off with impressive élan.
They do make a comeback of course - almost stronger than ever - in this, the best documentary of the year so far. Intelligent, honest, heartfelt and fascinating.	While Shut Up works great as music doc, progressive pep rally and neo-Capra triumph tale, it's even better as a bighearted tale of the love between three extraordinary women.	Documentarians Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck are skillful enough to tell this story from multiple angles, making Shut Up & Sing as insightful as it is entertaining.	A testimonial to the viability and efficiency of the American marketplace of ideas, where Toby Keith, Natalie Maines, Bill O'Reilly and millions of other voices are free to annoy, heckle, praise, please and sing...	These are very hot ladies -- as much for their looks as for their smart minds, values and talent. If you didn't admire and respect them before you see this film, I think you will, after.	Though ostensibly an intimate look at the Dixie Chicks after their 2003 anti-Bush remark, the film achieves broader relevance by exploring how media, politics, and celebrities intertwine.
A genuine American classic.	a truly classic, timeless film, one of the few that quite simply never grows old	As the hero, Mr. Stewart does a warmly appealing job, indicating that he has grown in spiritual stature as well as in talent during the years he was in the war. And Donna Reed is remarkably poised and gracious as his adoring sweet-heart and wife.	Not only as one of the best Christmas movies, but THE Christmas movie.	This classic delivers warmth all year long.	The holiday classic to define all holiday classics, It's a Wonderful Life is one of a handful of films worth an annual viewing.
It is, more or less, a journey through portals and dimensions that can only exist within the parallel universes of our minds. And yet, there it is, on screen and alive.	At the time of its release, it was probably the boldest, most experimental production to come out of Hollywood, which is why it is not terribly surprising that it was Disney's biggest commercial failure.	Though uneven, Fantasia is a film like no other and a milestone of filmmaking.	The most ambitious animated feature ever to come out of the Disney studios...	What better way to introduce kids to good music than by animating it with charming creatures?	A landmark in animation (and a huge influence on the medium of music video), Disney's Fantasia is a relentlessly inventive blend of the classics with phantasmagorical images.
It's magical when a film completely subvert our expectations and yet make it feel so obviously right, so inevitable, and so perfectly true to life. ... You won't see many films accomplish this better than Inside Out...	Inventive, imaginative and utterly original, it's a wonderful punch to the emotional solar plexus that will have you smiling through your tears, weeping with joy and embracing your sadness.	Kids will be engaged, but it's the older viewers - people who have lived and felt a little longer than 11-year-olds - who will most appreciate this marvelous, ingenious work of art.	The best animated movies are made as much for the grown-ups who will accompany the children as for the kids themselves. That's certainly true of "Inside Out" ...	Some of the complexity will probably be lost on younger viewers, but the story itself is entertaining enough to keep the kids' attention.	Inventive, gorgeously animated, and powerfully moving, Inside Out is another outstanding addition to the Pixar library of modern animated classics.
This concoction of cheesy layers is hokum of the most delightful kind.	Thanks to a clever script, tight direction, a first-rate cast and the dynamite combination of Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone, Blast from the Past blows away the recent crop of romantic comedies.	A sunny, good-natured romantic comedy that is as light as air, but almost always charming.	Once the movie decides the air is clear and Fraser begins walking the earth, Blast becomes much spottier at hitting its comic targets and suffers from a bad case of the cutes.	Walken's skill at warped humor isn't new, but Spacek is a revelation; her reactions and comic timing are all fabulous.	Cute idea, but not consistently funny.
A filling but unoriginal dish.	Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman is faithfully adapted into Los Angeles' Mexican-American subculture in this enjoyable ensemble film.	Tortilla Soup is a passable film, though it's exceptionally predictible, and far from original.	Charming.	Isn’t the delicacy that Eat Drink Man Woman was But on the level of comfort food this remake is enjoyable enough.	An English remake of Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman, Tortilla Soup is as charming and flavorful as the dishes it features.
Quiet. This might be the most accurate word to describe the elegant, perfectly composed surface of Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love.	This film raises its fascination with enveloping atmosphere and suppressed emotion to a ravishing, almost hypnotic level.	Agençant parfaitement la simplicité de son récit ŕ la complexité de sa mise en scčne, Wong Kar Wai nous livre au final un chef-d'%u0153uvre incontestable en son genre.	You'd be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful movie or one that possesses a more anguished sense of betrayal and loss.	Has a movie ever smoldered more ravishingly with the promise of sex than In the Mood for Love? Not in recent memory.	This understated romance, featuring good performances by its leads, is both visually beautiful and emotionally moving.
Sadly bland update of everyone's favorite girl detective series never rises above its Scooby Doo-level plot.	The film's and Nancy's nonjudgmental tone gives it a distinctly modern feel.	None of the dialogue is particularly pointed, and the supposed Hollywood mean teens seem rather tame. (One of their big pranks involves stealing Nancy's cupcake.)	It is smart enough to captivate not just the women who loved the books as kids, but also the boys and men that would normally disdain such a 'chick' flick. That nice Nancy Drew just has a way of winning people over.	An awkward mixture of send-up and formula kid's comedy that's only marginally better than the Olsen twins direct-to-video detective series.	Emma Roberts is bubbly and charming as Nancy Drew, the junior detective. But despite her best efforts, Nancy Drew still lacks excitement, surprise, and compelling secondary characters.
We're briefly reminded of the first film's poignancy and realize how much this one has forgotten it.	Mike and Sully together make a fine team. Their strengths and weaknesses match up well.	Pixar's emphasis on character and story made (and could make again) worlds that we fell in love with. Monsters University - a fun, disposable watch - has taken one of these worlds and repeated it to formula.	A thoroughly delightful, impressively animated, summer movie with plenty of laughs, a gentle wit and a surprisingly nuanced range of life lessons.	The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references.	Offering Monsters, Inc. fans a return visit with beloved characters, Monsters University delivers funny and thoughtful family entertainment for viewers of any age.
This jovial and knowing aperitif of a movie is a charming example of what has come to be known as the date movie.	Already burdened by Kate's clichéd voice-over observations, the movie eventually sinks beneath the weight of Kate and Adam's utter charmlessness, a huge liability in bickering romantic-comedy couples.	Refreshing depiction of today's dating game does for single women what Swingers did for single men.	An insufferably dull retracing of romantic comedy's steps, with none of the relationship insight or genuine humanness that can make the formula such a joyful one to follow.	Wait until it hits cable.	Famke Janssen's charm fails to rescue the movie from a dull screenplay.
It's far-fetched and a leap of faith of Olympic proportions is required to keep abreast of the plot, but August Rush does deliver some charming moments, largely due to charismatic performances from Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers	So gloriously, astonishingly nutty that it almost qualifies as an instant camp classic...the visual flamboyance only adds to the pretentious goofiness of it all.	Heart-warming, life-affirming fantasy - a magical, musical adventure, geared for families	A heartwarming fairy-tale that is undeniably sweet, even if it occasionally crosses over into sappiness.	Egregiously self-indulgent and mawkish fairy tale.	Though featuring a talented cast, August Rush cannot overcome the flimsy direction and schmaltzy plot.
This Tommy Boy is no pinball wizard, but you may leave the theatre wishing that the character were at least deaf, dumb, and blind.	The late Chris Farley's funniest work	It's some indication of the wit involved that Farley is reduced to cracking fat jokes at his own expense.	This is predictable and very silly stuff, but there are some solid laughs.	If this pairing sounds like movie magic to you, we're sure you'll love the picture.	Though it benefits from the comic charms of its two leads, Tommy Boy too often feels like a familiar sketch stretched thin.
Here's a little winner of a sports movie that became lost amidst the ogres and the pirates.	No matter how many times we've been through the ritual, it can still work when it's done well. And it's done quite well in Gracie, a familiar but rewarding little parable set in the world of small-town New Jersey soccer in the '70s.	Gracie is painless enough and, at times, even enjoyable. But it suffers from an overriding feeling that this would be better positioned as a made-for-TV feature.	Despite flaws, though, this stirring independent production is remarkable for its honest portrayal of a family grappling with grief and a female taking the penalty kick to score points for gender equity.	There's not a lot wrong with this feel-good sports drama except that it's much like the 873 other feel-good sport dramas we've seen this year. I like it anyway, for its go-girl spunk and tenderly solemn spirit.	Gracie can be rousing and touching in spots, but is ultimately undone by its predictable story arc and a lack of nuance.
Kevin Spacey beams down another winner...	... a mixed bag, containing some interesting moment but filled with unrealized secondary characters.	The overarching theme of this well-acted and spirited sci-fi drama is that we all can be medicine for one another.	El manejo de la luz, el tono de los reflejos y el uso de colores y su temperatura es muy correcto, la puesta en escena como tal vale el pago del boleto por completo...	Bridges completely steals the show from the more lauded Spacey, who's simply on autopilot throughout.	For those who have seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or Starman, K-Pax may not hold anything new. The movie works best as a showcase for Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges.
The result is simply spellbinding.	Who is the star here, Neil Young or Hank William's guitar?	This Prairie Wind concert is one long sweet twang of wistful not-quite-regret.	Demme makes you part of the experience in a way that few concert films truly achieve.	Proves it's better to burn out, than to fade away.	Proving that it's neither better to burn out nor fade away, Neil Young: Heart of Gold works both as a concert film and a meditation on mortality.
CinemaScope and a broad syllabus can't convert this imperishable metaphor into acceptable matinee fodder.	The film's epic scope ... evocative vocal talent and non-stop exploits successfully transport you to another world.	This is good-looking artwork and the story is strong.	Your best bet is to forget the story and concentrate on the animation.	...Sorely lacking in the magic and majesty we have come to expect in the wake of other recent Disney cartoon products.	Atlantis provides a fast-paced spectacle, but stints on such things as character development and a coherent plot.
It inspires serious second thoughts the next time you leave the lights on or your computer idling.	Where the stunt ends and experiment begins is hard to tell...	Fortunately for the sake of documentary, Beavan is no humorless eco-scold, and he makes it clear that he's engaged in a lifestyle experiment, not recommending this extreme course for everyone.	It all seems like a stunt, especially since Beaven has also written a just-published book about his experiences, but he and Conlin are an engaging pair who don't let zealotry get in the way of humor.	An enviro-doc that doesn't soft-pedal the fact that the calculated, consciousness-raising media event it chronicles is a conceptual stunt, No Impact Man manages to present its New York do-gooder couple as both likably idealistic and inevitably conf	Half enviro-saving doc, half publicity stunt, No Impact Man is inspiring and fun to both casual activists and hardcore recyclers.
Innocence is entirely absent from this extremely dubious addition to the big-screen adventures of Ronald Searle's cartoon creations.	indifferent to storytelling, craft and, dare I mention, fresh ideas	Everett almost single-handedly sustains the film, thanks to a nicely pitched turn as the headmistress with a heart.	With the right attitude this cheerfully calculated effort to update the old girl for a tween market can be enjoyed in all its endearing awfulness, as a loony High School Musical with posher accents and a lot more going on upstairs.	Colin Firth's humiliation is a thing of wonder. His entire career on screen and stage is beautifully sent up before our eyes.	Both naughtier and campier than Ronald Searle's original post war series, this St. Trinian's leans on high jinks instead of performances or witty dialogue.
Even if it is a compromised version of the TV show, it's far, far better than nothing.	For Bat enthusiasts, this is a gold mine, for everyone else? A passable cult film.	Batman is packed with action, clever sight gags, interesting complications and goes all out on bat with batmania: batplane, batboat, batcycle, etc. etc.	The film should make a mint for everybody.	1960s flick won't appeal to today's kids.	Batman: The Movie elevates camp to an art form -- and has a blast doing it, every gloriously tongue-in-cheek inch of the way.
From one funny scene to another, Wedding throws so many laughs at the audience you can barely keep up.	This third piece of the eternally coming-of-age group of youngsters delivers all the snorts and belly laughs you'd hope for from a good, old-fashioned gross-out comedy.	Once again, as in the first two movies, there is a lot of talk about sex and a lot of attempts to have sex, but the sex that actually occurs is almost entirely respectful, monogamous, and really quite sweet.	The gross and the sweet are inextricably intertwined in this series.	If all you're looking for is a good laugh, you won't be disappointed. This is easily the funniest film of the season.	Raunchier and even more gross than the first two American Pies, American Wedding ought to please fans of the series.
Interessante filme que mostra a realidade polьtica e social no Irс, o autoritarismo com relaусo Яs mulheres e as contradiушes de um paьs governado pela religiosidade.	A beguiling, slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in Iran.	Too slow, too long and too little happens.	Beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm.	There are some really funny moments in here.	A moderately funny comedy that will reward patient viewers.
Ladies and gentlemen: believe the buzz! WALL-E is a bona-fide, all out masterpiece.	I think Wall-E is a masterpiece. The folks at Pixar never rest on their laurels. They continue to push the limits of both computer animation and the storytelling possibilities that accompany it.	Vastly overrated movie with all the charm of two vacuum cleaners making love.	You have heard it said that there are but two constants in the universe: death and taxes. It's time a third constant was added to the list: Pixar can do no wrong.	In a world that is moving too fast and changing too rapidly, a moment to pause and and reflect on what's really important in life and enjoy it at the same time is rare. There are lots of those moments in WALL-E.	Wall-E's stellar visuals testify once again to Pixar's ingenuity, while its charming star will captivate younger viewers -- and its timely story offers thought-provoking subtext.
Sean Astin is utterly winning...	Terrific-but-manipulative drama about the power of following one's dreams.	It's Ruettiger's persistence that his teammates and the film celebrate. For that, Rudy earns a rousing cheer.	[A] well-crafted piece of middle-American uplift.	continues to make life seem a little better	Though undeniably sentimental and predictable, Rudy succeeds with an uplifting spirit and determination.
[A] rare work of art that thrills the senses and the mind.	A painstaking study in courage and conviction under agonizing pressure.	It's hard to believe that Melville's 1969 masterpiece--one of the most accurate chronicles of the French Resistance--never got released in the US until 2006; Splendidly acted, this film draws on the helmer's own experience.	A film to be seen and savored for its moral magnitude.	It is arguably the tensest, hardest-edged movie of Melville's career ... and that's saying something.	Originally made in 1969, this recently reissued classic is a masterful examination of the inner workings of the World War II resistance efforts.
Blocky plot turns and historical inaccuracies occasionally distract, but overall there are barrels of delicious swordplay, some particularly jaw dropping equestrian stunts, along with Banderas' winking wit, and Zeta-Jones smoldering confidence.	Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones still sizzle as the crime-fighter and his equally fearless wife, but their playful banter takes a back seat to the convoluted narrative, an unwieldy amalgam of swordplay, tiresome family drama.	The ludicrous plot and special effects featuring cartoon physics means this zero is strictly for those under the age of eight or so.	If the question is whether passion, excitement and intrigue can be written into the narrative of marriage, the answer in The Legend of Zorro is an emphatic no.	Some definitive things happened in the first one that it would seem they couldn't replay the same shenanigans. But they found a way.	Zorro can survive a lot of things, but it looks like he can't survive marriage.
Burdened with uneven acting and portentous dialogue, the film has one important saving grace. Franz Lustig's cinematography exquisitely captures the grandeur and loneliness of the American West.	Visually majestic but dramatically inert.	... the story ... isn't big enough to stand up to the characters who blow through it or to resist being overwhelmed by the geography on which it's set.	Much as you want to walk away from the messes it makes, Don't Come Knocking is like a performing panhandler on the subway whose shtick is just funny enough to grab your attention -- along with a little loose change.	The dusty backdrop evokes a palpable sense of transience and the lingering past, but there's ultimately very little beneath the gesturing.	The cinematography conjures beautifully evocative landscapes, but aside from that, the film is meandering and pointless.
The lavish, super-cute new version of The Parent Trap is a remake of the 1961 Hayley Mills hit, which was seriously adorable in its own right	Every once in a while, uncomplicated and inoffensive fun feels just right.	Vanilla and sweet, it's an overly generous helping that, if it doesn't make you sick, will put you in a good humor all day long.	The spunky Lindsay Lohan, the lead in Disney's remake of The Parent Trap is one of the best new actresses in years.	Movies like this remember how much fun escapism can be.	Writer-director Nancy Meyers takes the winning formula of the 1961 original and gives it an amiable modern spin, while young star Lindsay Lohan shines in her breakout role.
It's a mostly unnecessary addition to the smart, exciting "Bourne" trilogy.	One analyst spits out that "he's Treadstone without the inconsistencies." It seems that Legacy is Bourne with some added in.	"How doesn't really matter, does it?" yells Ed Norton, about half way through this muddled spinoff. I was so relieved, no longer having to sweat the small stuff, like plot.	"The Bourne Legacy" is always gripping in the moment. The problem is in getting the moments to add up.	Might pass muster as a serviceable, if infuriatingly coy, Bourne spin-off if the lead were not so woefully miscast.	It isn't quite as compelling as the earlier trilogy, but The Bourne Legacy proves the franchise has stories left to tell -- and benefits from Jeremy Renner's magnetic work in the starring role.
About guilt and responsibility, about loss, about the terrible things human beings do, and the moments of serenity and spiritual succor to be gleaned from the natural world.	But what's so surprising about Poetry is Lee's unassuming mastery over the elements therein.	Well-crafted and compelling, if a little inaccessible to western audiences...	Completely engrossing.	[An] exquisite Korean drama by Secret Sunshine's Lee Chang-dong.	Poetry is an absorbing, poignant drama because it offers no easy answers to its complex central conflict.
Lord of War has a surreal edge, despite being enmeshed in world events, with absurdity and dark humor laced throughout.	Unlike Cage's reliable merchandise in the film, Niccol's supposedly explosive exposé misfires with every other shot.	It gives moviegoers something to think about. If that recommendation sounds too dutiful, let it be known that it's exciting as well as thought-provoking.	Niccol's script is finally too much for the film to hold onto.	Andrew Niccol takes on a huge issue and gives it the Goodfellas treatment...[but it is] less successful, overlong and not as emotionally engaging	While Lord of War is an intelligent examination of the gun trade, it is too scattershot in its plotting to connect.
If you're considering seeing Death Race this weekend, send me ten bucks and I'll personally come to your house and punch you in the face instead. It will be more dramatically rewarding.	The main problem with the new film is that it tries to make the whole thing credible, whereas the original never tried to make any sense.	An orgasmic mix of on-road mayhem that plays at 1000 miles per hour! Marvel in some terrifically-choreographed stunt	Yes, Death Race is as brutal as a punch in the face. If you have a hankering for B-movie grime and gore, it can also be a lot of fun.	exists so critics will have something to put on their year-end "Worst Of" lists.	Mindless, violent, and lightning-paced, Death Race is little more than an empty action romp.
Palace intrigue at its finest.	Eventually, the movie, as with other similarly humane and perceptive comedies, allows its audience to see that not only does everyone have his or her reasons for behaving as they do, those reasons may be far less easy to dismiss as one supposes.	[Frears is] a master at creating a cinematic style that perfectly reflects the subject of the screenplay.	Un retrato íntimo e interesante en el que lo más sobresaliente es, por lejos, la sobria composición de Helen Mirren.	It is Mirren's fine performance that carries this film to the level of art. It takes guts to portray a living figurehead like Queen Elizabeth II, and Mirren captures her essence without ever stooping to caricature.	Full of wit, humor, and pathos, Stephen Frears' moving portrait of the British royals during the period after Princess Diana's death features not one but two remarkable performances, that of Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Sheen as the newly-ordained Prime Minister Tony Blair. They embody their characters and lay bare the motivations behind these prominent people, giving viewers a glimpse into the inner workings of the British monarchy.
Violent and sexy and funny and sad.	Probably the first reaction is to resist, but that would be a mistake. Head-On is one powerful film.	The story builds which such force that the fate of these unlikely heroes truly matters.	Sloppy, melodramatic yet, ultimately, immensely affecting.	The power of the individual gives an urgency to the broader implications.	A raw, provocative drama about star-crossed love and the lives of immigrants caught between the traditional and modern.
Loud and long, this 3rd installment boasts a better plot and impressive CGI while maintaining its juvenile level of comedy - the target audience will likely love it.	Easily transformed into the worst summer blockbuster of the year.	...it takes a certain talent to create as much action as Bay does without generating an ounce of excitement.	Remarkable action set pieces and stunning effects, but this third outing of Transformers is sometimes just as clunky and irritating as the second.	An overlong ordeal, devoid of excitement and intrigue.	Its special effects -- and 3D shots -- are undeniably impressive, but they aren't enough to fill up its loud, bloated running time, or mask its thin, indifferent script.
A major disappointment. Soderbergh has stripped the story of most of its drama and though Del Toro, who won Best Actor at Cannes last year, is very convincing as Che, this Spanish-language film almost seems like an anti-movie.	These are films that are certainly thought out clearly but not nearly felt enough.	Benicio del Toro looks the part, but Soderbergh does little to flesh out his other characters. Just following what is happening is hard work.	Soderbergh has no interest in sentimentality, or back story, or even really in Guevara's philosophy, except as a rigorously footnoted onscreen reflection. Practically rejecting outright the concept of poetic license, Che is radical as a biopic.	simultaneously a Hollywood throwback with its lengthy, four-and-a-half-hour roadshow grandiosity and a challenging experiment in genre reformulation	Though lengthy and at times plodding, Soderbergh's vision and Benicio Del Toro's understated performance ensure that Che always fascinates.
It is perhaps high time for us to just come out and finally admit to the world that director Guy Ritchie is not a very good filmmaker.	A complex, violent and fun look at the London underworld, "RocknRolla" is for grownups who like gritty action and complex tales.	Rocknrolla may not be the real thing...but it's the closest Ritchie's been in an age.	A messy, often self-indulgent film with some redeeming features (including some of its humour), Guy Ritchie's crime thriller has above average intelligence, a great cast but a below par story structure.	Some movies go off on tangents. This movie is nothing but tangents.	Mixed reviews for Guy Ritchie's return to his London-based cockney wideboy gangster movie roots, but most agree, it's a step in the right direction following two major turkeys.
Instead of improving on the Disney animation experience, El Dorado proves to be inferior in every way.	The story is a bit thin and predictable, but the chemistry between the romantic, reckless Miguel (Branagh) and the more practical and frustrated Tulio (Kline) makes El Dorado work.	An enjoyable diversion even if it isn't (and it isn't) the animated masterpiece that DreamWorks' CGI Antz was.	I expect to roll my eyes several times while the kids consume their dose of morality. In contrast, El Dorado skips the preaching and focuses more on the comedy.	The songs should go. They're filler, but so is the movie itself, a cartoon to keep kids semi-happy until the next one comes along.	Predictable story and thin characters made the movie flat.
Elle Fanning is vivid in her conveyance of the hurt, anger and loneliness of being different.	Touching, at times intense drama teaches tolerance, empathy.	There's no denying the cast (which also includes Bill Pullman and Campbell Scott) is terrific and that first time writer/director Daniel Barnz has stacked the deck for his precious indie flick.	Phoebe may not be schizophrenic, but any movie that simultaneously wants to trouble and reassure, to keep it real and then traffic in wish fulfillment, certainly is.	It's a rare thing when a labor of love turns out to be worth both the labor and the love.	Blessed with a good cast, Phoebe's heart is in the right place, but its execution is dicey.
One actor. One setting. No back story. No dialogue. One hell of a movie.	Five minutes alone with him in All Is Lost will make you feel like a chump for ever suspecting [Redford] was done for. The charisma never went away; it's only aged into a very fine vintage, indeed.	A grim and rather relentless analogy for the slow march towards death: every bad thing can and does happen, with almost comical inevitability, and by the hour mark, you find yourself begging for a shark attack that might put poor Red out of his misery.	As written and directed by young American filmmaker J.C. Chandor, All is Lost is a classic case of man-against-nature.	This film makes an excellent case that sometimes less can be so much more.	Anchored by another tremendous performance in a career full of them, All Is Lost offers a moving, eminently worthwhile testament to Robert Redford's ability to hold the screen.
...still a hilarious movie, and anyone with a funny bone in his body will probably find it amusing.	It would have been nothing without Leslie Nielsen, but this was one of the funniest slapstick comedies of the 1980s.	Absolutely hysterical!	The film is as transparent as a third-grader with a water gun, and yet I would rather review a new film by Ingmar Bergman, for there, at least, would be themes to discuss and visual strategies to analyze.	The Naked Gun is hugely funny, but it`s also liberating-precisely because it centers its aim on that cold, closed system and blows it apart. The straight lines are shattered; the empty spaces in the images are packed full until they burst.	The Naked Gun is chock full of gags that are goofy, unapologetically crass, and ultimately hilarious.
Alexander, as expressed through the weepy histrionics of Colin Farrell, is more like a desperate housewife than a soldier.	Farrell plays all this as if he means it, but he seems slight in the role and without great physical presence.	At a reported cost of $155 million, Alexander qualifies as a super-spectacle in every respect but one -- namely in its neurotic, confused and sexually ambidextrous hero.	An enormous cinematic mess. Alexander is not so much mind-numbingly boring as it is intriguingly nonsensical.	Unwieldy and flawed, but Stone remains a tornado in an era of airless formula and -- to paraphrase our Ptolemy -- its failings are greater than most films' successes.	Even at nearly three hours long, this ponderous, talky, and emotionally distant biopic fails to illuminate Alexander's life.
If you ride the paranoiac tide, letting Jonathan Demme's assured direction carry you along, the sardonic humor and anxiety-inducing message work on you.	That rare remake that paves its own way without exploiting or cheapening its predecessor.	This is a good old-fashioned thriller, nothing less, and nothing more.	Despite the political pizzazz and updated plot twists, the film still felt like a rerun.	Crisp pacing, an agitated sense of an unraveling reality and a uniformly strong cast earn this edition of The Manchurian Candidate a vote of recommendation.	While not the classic its predecessor is, this update is well-acted and conjures a chilling resonance.
Like all great love stories, Ang Lee's is one of tragic romance, strongly acted by Heath Ledger as the most buttoned-up of cowboys, and Michelle Williams as his betrayed and enraged wife.	Michelle Williams nearly steals the film as Ennis's wife in a quiet, complex, heartbreaking performance that will certainly garner award consideration. I can't believe how good of an actress she's become.	Brokeback Mountain is about as close to perfection as it's possible to come in modern Hollywood.	This here film, aint yer ma's cowboy tale none...	Foremost about a love that can never break out of its societal prison.	A beautiful, epic Western, Brokeback Mountain's love story is imbued with heartbreaking universality thanks to moving performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.
Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is every bit as sumptuous as everyone had expected.	Attenborough's work lacks even the undercurrent of personality that David Lean brought to his films: the film has no flavor but that of the standard Hollywood hagiography.	Epic tale about one man's journey down the transforming path of wisdom and peace.	Ben Kingsley is nothing short of mesmerizing in the title role.	A remarkable experience.	Director Richard Attenborough is typically sympathetic and sure-handed, but it's Ben Kingsley's magnetic performance that acts as the linchpin for this sprawling, lengthy biopic.
The adrenaline rush the film produces disguises a rather thin plotline, and helps the viewer overlook the nearly suffocating air of self-seriousness.	If it feels like a non-stop demolition derby, at least there's a responsible driver at the wheel. The British director Paul Greengrass makes everything seem more plausible with twitchy camerawork and even twitchier editing.	The story of Jason Bourne is the story of the spy movie all grown up.	As spy flicks go, The Bourne Ultimatum is the perfect chaser to this successful series.	Bourne -- or whatever his name really is -- is such a resourceful and reckless agent of chaos, we thrill to him despite the fact that he's officially a non-entity.	The Bourne Ultimatum is an intelligent, finely tuned non-stop thrill ride. Another strong performance from Matt Damon and sharp camerawork from Paul Greengrass make this the finest installment of the Bourne trilogy.
Duvall turns Felix into much more than a grump with a secret, even if Get Low leans too hard on that secret.	A slow-burn rural drama that seems to unfold somewhere between real-life and deep-fried folk tale, Get Low serves as a reminder that the pleasures of life as frequently lie in the journey as the destination.	Featuring some enthralling performances from Murray, Spacek and last but by no means least the great Duvall, you might find yourself whimpering unexpectedly in this looming yet comical adaptation of a Tennessee fable.	Simple, straightforward and stirring without sentimentality, Get Low is a treasure.	This is not a big film, but is one with a very big heart.	Subtle to a fault, this perfectly cast ensemble drama is lifted by typically sharp performances from Robert Duvall and Bill Murray.
Jeepers Creepers may sputter in the last reel, but it still delivers enough style and scares to warrant a look by horror aficionados.	As the plot hemorrhages from one dire encounter to another, the clichéd old psychic routine is used to explain the plot to anyone who might still care.	A cover- your-face, duck-in -your-seat, scream-out -loud slasher that, for the first hour, pushes so many of the right buttons.	One of the most terrifying horror movies to come along in years...	Habrá quien le rinda aplauso de pie, y habrá quien lo aborrezca y desee lo peor para el director, pero les prometo que no les dejará indiferentes...	Jeepers Creepers has a promising start. Unfortunately, the tension and suspense quickly deflates into genre cliches as movie goes on.
A thorough and decently intentioned work, though it accepts a little too glibly the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger line against Assange: that he is a fascinating radical who simply became a paranoid authoritarian.	You'll leave knowing slightly more about the who, what and why of WikiLeaks; you'll also wish the whole shebang didn't fell like such a tone-deaf data dump overall.	Arguably furthers WikiLeaks' stated purpose, but with a necessary whiff of the investigative filmmaker's instinctive skepticism.	This is an expertly organised documentary; Gibney's always are.	Noxious government activities may warrant exposure, but Gibney points out that the whistleblowers can be pretty flawed too.	As fascinating as it is provocative, We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks presents another documentary triumph for director Alex Gibney, as well as a troubling look at one of the more meaningful issues of our time.
In addition to the two female leads, filmmaker Brougher does exceptionally commendable work.	Skillful interweaving of two stories: one of a teen who may have killed her newborn; another of a psychologist interviewing her who desperately wants a baby.	Thought-provoking and mesmerising.	Stephanie Daley stands out for Amber Tamblyn's (The Grudge 2, Joan of Arcadia) unbelievable performance in the title role.	...a fine and foreboding duet of character study	The premise has all the trappings of melodrama, but the excellent performances give the characters complexity and empathy.
True story of a Jewish pianist; OK for older kids.	One of the very few nondocumentary movies about Jewish life and death under the Nazis that can be called definitive.	The Pianist is a serious movie brought out in a tabloid-besotted time, a prestige picture that invigorates, a study of character and history that knows irony to be a part of life and not the purpose of art.	There are films so meaningful that to miss them is to miss part of our collective education. Roman Polanski's The Pianist is such a picture.	Brody made me understand his character's torment but more in a clinical way than in an emotional one. Polanski needed just a bit more depth in his protagonist.	Well-acted and dramatically moving, The Pianist is Polanski's best work in years.
When it is good it is very, very good, and when it's not it's mediocre.	A well-observed, sideways portrait of the day, Unconscious is a little gem.	Are the Spanish the only ones these days able to make movie comedies that are smart, sexy, wacky and graceful all at once?	Film is ultimately unsure of what it wants to say about modernity, psychoanalysis and all it liberates.	The Freudian farce Unconscious is paced so breathlessly that it keeps you panting to keep up with each new plot twist.	A comedy that tackles outrageous subjects (pornography, transvestism, bisexuality and drug abuse) with both grace and mischievous glee.
The movie pays off generously and just as expected.	A strong action movie with a vicious punch and well defined, interesting characters .	The show really belongs to Willis, who brings a hangdog authority to the midlife action pose of paunchy, hungover, yet ready to rock and roll.	... a satisfying piece of genre filmmaking.	Time and again, it paints its heroes into a series of fascinating corners, only to set them free with uninspired and compulsory waves of its hand.	Despite strong performances from Bruce Willis and Mos Def, 16 Blocks is a shopworn entry in the buddy-action genre.
John Carpenter completists generally hate this slab of satiric sci-fi, but it's one of my favorite junk movies and a sure-fire Halloween rental.	The black-and-white visuals disturb for only so long, and while themes of indoctrination and conspiracy prove initially intriguing, the film quickly descends into fistfights and gunfire.	An erratically amusing throwback to the science-fiction paranoia films of the 1950s.	John Carpenter's They Live has cult favorite written all over it, and part of the reason is the way it regenerates the cheap, juicy, surprisingly potent sci-fi of the 1950s.	They Live is a paranoid thriller that stretches a paper-thin budget with inventive special effects that serve the story and a message that still holds water today.	A politically subversive blend of horror and sci fi, They Live is an underrated genre film from John Carpenter.
Amid the requisite topical references, the film includes throwback violence (plainly inspired by the work of Warner Bros. and the great Chuck Jones), lunatic and incessant.	2006 has not been a kind year to the animated genre and the empty, irresponsible Over the Hedge is so far the worst of the lot.	The new Dreamworks CGI animated feature ignores much of the satire and tries to cram the rest into the usual kids movie format.	It is a truly for-all-ages movie that is a joy to behold.	Intelligent jokes are set up and paid off, rather than blurred by an endless string of instantly-outdated pop culture references.	Even if it's not an animation classic, Over the Hedge is clever and fun, and the jokes cater to family members of all ages.
Gimmick-y, sitcom-type fun.	The first and the best, only rivaled by CHRISTMAS VACATION. Revel in the days when Chase was funny!	National Lampoon's Vacation is a comedic cross-country adventure like no other, thanks to Chevy Chase and the rest of the Griswold family.	...a zany, lighthearted look at numbskull American tourism at its most chaotic.	National Lampoon's Vacation is an enjoyable trip through familiar comedy landscapes.	Blessed by a brilliantly befuddled star turn from Chevy Chase, National Lampoon's Vacation is one of the more consistent -- and thoroughly quotable -- screwball comedies of the 1980s.
A parabolic film about one selfish young man's spiritual transformation.	Veterans Garner and Brian Dennehy give convincing professional performances here, but Fuller is bland.	If The Ultimate Gift really wanted to embrace a powerful Christian message, it would've made Jason's ordeal truly threatening and genuinely transformative.	Wholesome and inspirational, it preaches a simplistic "prosperity gospel."	It does telegraph its sentiments with all the subtlety of a greeting card.	Though The Ultimate Gift avoids religious speechifying like other Fox Faith films, it's dramatically inert with flat direction.
What's good about the film are the strong performances and the ingenious, mostly amusing script. What's ugly, of course, is the grossness. And what's bad is the movie's inability to reconcile its good and ugly aspects.	The Fly is almost unique for a horror movie in that it compels us sympathize with and root for the characters.	A gross-your-eyes-out horror movie that is also the year's most poignant romance.	Kafka would have loved it.	Cronenberg at his peak, an artful and disturbing horror film blended with - of all things - a sharp romantic comedy.	David Cronenberg combines his trademark affinity for gore and horror with strongly developed characters, making The Fly a surprisingly affecting tragedy.
Nacho Libre, with its relatively (and refreshingly) tame PG rating, is likely to thrill boys under 13. But it may also evoke laughs even if you're far removed from that demographic.	[Jack Black] dives headlong into the physical stunts and the bizarre wackiness with so much enthusiasm, you can't help but enjoy yourself.	Napoleon Dynamite's racism was unmistakable, Nacho Libre's less so, subverted as it is by Jack Black's comic humanism.	Sometimes it looks like a movie that was more fun to make than it is to watch.	The movie is semi-infantile camp but often riotous.	At times hilarious, but other times offensive, Director Jared Hess is unable to recapture the collective charisma of his Napoleon characters, instead relying on a one-joke concept that runs out of steam. Sure to entertain the adolescents, however.
Ultimately, it's an invitation best refused. 'The Strangers' offers a few memorable scares, but it is less chilling in its simplicity than numbing in its banality.	It's all efficiently nerve-jangling, with Tyler and Speedman credibly registering every hue of panic.	Is Hollywood so disconnected from its past and bankrupt of ideas that it doesn't even know this movie is a screaming cliché?	It sounds stupid enough, and ultimately is, but the director, Bryan Bertino, stages The Strangers' early scenes with spooky panache.	...a grab-bag of nifty widescreen compositions and sound design stingers, with nothing on its mind besides its own virtuosity.	The Strangers provides a few scares, but offers little else to distinguish itself from other slasher films.
The confused script even bungles its central dramatic situation.	It may not be a perfect film, but it's just nice to see a master at work.	An intelligent, old-fashioned nail-biter.	Even though The Interpreter is put together from pieces of a half dozen other, mostly better, movies, it still qualifies as the best thriller of the year so far.	Pollack thinks six moves ahead and distracts us with further intensity before unveiling his masterful rendezvous with all the major players and a city bus.	A polished and intelligent thriller, though marred by plot implausibilities.
Stands out as one of the year's best films.	An actor's movie full of little pleasures, with a few unexpected sparks.	A thoroughly enjoyable comedy about a horrible man.	This movie was a nice try.	A solid contender this holiday season.	James L. Brooks and Jack Nicholson, doing what they do best, combine smart dialogue and flawless acting to squeeze fresh entertainment value out of the romantic-comedy genre.
The sheer force and fearlessness of Dench's performance is something to behold, as Barbara's deeply ingrained class and personal resentments mix with a discomfiting neediness.	Note to self: accept no British imports trying to be American trash.	The movie's driving force is Dench, whose extraordinary performance only underscores her post as one of the world's finest living actresses.	Stages the story with a tastefulness both ponderous and dishonest	Notes on a Scandal's resolution is a bit less challenging than the finale of Heller's novel, but for the most part it's equally scathing, a nasty little peek into the worst of human behavior.	In this sharp psychological thriller, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett give fierce, memorable performances as two schoolteachers locked in a battle of wits.
An enjoyable, if conventional and manipulative small-town sports melodrama, boasting strong turns from Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper, who received his only acting nomination for his part.	Basketball fans will be weeping like babies.	Superbly evocative, deeply stirring.	Why fight it?	Any list of the best sports movies has to include Hoosiers.	It may adhere to the sports underdog formula, but Hoosiers has been made with such loving craft, and features such excellent performances, that it's hard to resist.
It plays your lacrimal glands like a violin, but honorably so.	Bring plenty of hankies if you accompany your children to this latest screen incarnation of the beloved collie.	Writer/director Charles Sturridge adapts the heart-warming story with strict attention to its modest emotional underpinnings of family, devotion, and a beautiful collie.	Everything old is new again in the latest film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang.	A nice, pleasant, quietly engaging but slow and determinedly old-school piece of family entertainment.	A beautifully-made retelling of the classic collie tale, one need not be a dog-lover to fall for Lassie.
Has the potential to not only become the top-earner for New York-based Arthouse Films when it opens Friday at the Angelika Film Center but also one of the year's best-reviewed documentaries.	Walker finds inspiration and strange beauty in the squalor.	[Muniz's] intention to have them re-create photographic images of themselves out of garbage, while it may not pass muster as high art, has the effect of raising their spirits. At least for a while, their lives, and ours, have been transformed.	Walker's documentary is moving, life-affirming and challenges what you think you might know about these people who pick through the rubbish.	Rather than issuing a warning blow to either our guts or our hearts, it's something of a soft wakeup nudge aimed somewhere in-between.	Waste Land begins with an eco-friendly premise, but quickly transforms into an uplifting portrait of the power of art and the dignity of the human spirit.
Here is the starting-point of so much modern cinema.	An eternal masterpiece.	The restoration eliminates nearly all the distracting cracks and splices and stabilizes images that were previously jittery, allowing us to admire them in all their complex glory.	If you've never seen the German expressionist landmark "Metropolis" on a big screen, get moving.	Here's a coincidence: The first must-see movie of 2010 is also the must-see movie of 1927. The difference is that you can actually see it now. Or most of it.	A visually awe-inspiring science fiction classic from the silent era.
A film that brings the food and spirit of Italy to your doorstep in a light hearted set of afternoons with the grandmothers of Rome.	[Di Gregorio] draws wonderfully unfussy performances from his nonprofessional cast and ... produces a film which feels so natural that it seems to be capturing real life	A tasty tidbit of a film, Mid-August Lunch is one of those movies where almost nothing happens but it happens quite nicely.	The semi-improvised performances and gently nostalgic tone makes this endearing and captivating.	In just 75 minutes the director convinces us that girls just want to have fun--even when they're 90.	Thoughtful, warm-hearted, and delightfully free of pretense, Mid-August Lunch offers viewers a light diversion with some surprising depth.
River Phoenix gives a somnambulant impersonation of Christian Slater impersonating Jack Nicholson, and Samantha Mathis spends much of the movie trying to figure out exactly who her character is.	Perhaps no one could have saved Phoenix, who was not lucky enough to find a higher bottom than death. But this performance in this movie should have been seen by someone as a cry for help.	Perhaps there's not much new to say about the dues and disappointments involved in breaking into the country music scene, but the scenes are fresh and the emotions real in Peter Bogdanovich's tune-laden, mixed-mood drama.	It's good enough to watch, but not good enough to re-watch.	It's so sad that Phoenix went out not with a bang but with this whimper.	The last film River Phoenix completed before his death, The Thing Called Love doesn't have much new to say about show business, but it's energetic and well acted.
Mills allows one half of his story to subtly shape the other in a way that makes for a more coherent and rewarding tale than its disparate elements suggest.	One can only regret this writer-director's decision to cram so much material into the mix that some fine understated performances, and much of the film's emotional impact, are obscured along the way.	If this is style over substance filmmaking, then I don't think my tear ducts could handle substance over style.	Mike Mills has taken a particularly confusing and painful part of his own life and turned it into a moving expression of acceptance, compromise, and the struggle to overcome obstacles.	The film is not about a straight man's struggle to understand how his father is gay; it's about learning that happiness is always possible if you're brave enough to keep your heart open.	Wearing its twee heart on its sleeve, Beginners explores the depths of modern, multi-generational romance with wit and depth.
The dull dialogue and predictable action corrals the actors.	Wholesome, family-friendly, nicely photographed and, unfortunately, dull.	It's an old fashioned and reasonably satisfying family film that will work just as well if you wait for video.	Girl meets horse yet again in this entertainingly ridiculous update of Mary O'Hara's 1941 childrens novel, My Friend Flicka.	Often very beautiful looking, but gracelessly directed.	The rebellious protagonist will rally girls and children, but adults may find Flicka saddled with thin characters, over-the-top dialogue, and a plot that wanders into the countryside and never comes back.
Despite its imperfections, Fay Grim is worth seeing for Posey's and Goldblum's performances and particularly for the witty, literate dialogue.	Hartley's 1997 allegory about art and celebrity "Henry Fool," which divided critics and never found an audience, gets a loose, uneven updating in this surreal espionage thriller that plays like John Le Carre recast as postmodern absurdist yarn.	Hartley has been on a spotty run; his last film to get a proper theatrical release in Portland was made nearly a decade ago. But he recovers nicely with this witty, crackpot comedy about love, espionage, trust and secrecy.	Shows Hartley shrinking even as he goes global	Overall, though, Fay Grim only occasionally connects with the viewer. It is a film so caught up in its own cleverness and cheekiness that -- despite the solid work by its cast -- it forgets to make you truly care about its characters.	Fay Grim is too concerned with its own farcical premise to present a coherent, involving story.
This is take-no-prisoners cinema by an artist too honest to exempt himself from its scalding gaze.	An odd, scattered, free-form, but thoroughly engaging film.	Not to be missed.	Watching the movie now, 39 years after it was made, I'm struck most by its sadness, its harshness, and its pessimism.	It could shake up young viewers now as it 40 years ago, except that there's no French New Wave momentum of film passion.	A '60s time capsule stuffed with ideas about politics, pop culture, and the battle of the sexes, Masculine-Feminine is one of Godard's classic black-and-white films.
A spellbinding character study mystery made even more fascinating by the thought that its premise is far closer to becoming reality than most of its sci-fi peers.	It's at once a thought-provoking drama and a pulse-quickening thriller.	Ex Machina is beautiful and ominous and features another delicately nuanced performance from Isaac, who's quickly making a habit of them. But in the end, for all of Garland's ambition, his reach winds up exceeding his grasp.	Ex Machina is smart, sexy and thrilling sci-fi filmmaking at its most fascinating.	It makes up for its linearity with verve, first in the impeccably controlled, intellectually rigorous direction, and then in the performances.	Ex Machina leans heavier on ideas than effects, but it's still a visually polished piece of work -- and an uncommonly engaging sci-fi feature.
Little Man is a comedy based on a single gag that's not very funny. Therefore, it's exactly one joke short of being a one-joke film.	In spite of the admirable effort that the Wayans brothers went to in digitally transplanting Marlon Wayans head and facial expressions onto the two-foot-six-inch body of a nine-year-old actor, "Little Man" is a bawdy and violent comedy that rankles more t	Another gimmicky one-joke comedy from the Wayans brothers that may not use as much makeup as White Chicks but lots more special effects and is even more dreadful.	A slap-happy misadventure featuring Marlon Wayans as a foul-mouthed midget masquerading as a baby in order to retrieve a pilfered diamond from a childless couple.	[The film features] nonstop slapstick, potty jokes, and sexual gags.	Another gimmicky comedy from the Wayans brothers, Little Man comes with the requisite raunchiness, but forgot to bring the laughs.
It isn't really about anything except making a commercial narrative movie outside the industry.	From the get-go, Blood Simple demonstrates the originality, warped sensibility and bravura filmmaking that have marked nearly all Coen brothers films.	A stylish piece of film noir, it has exasperatingly slow pacing but devilishly demented characters and a wonderfully wicked, labyrinthine plot.	Useless update	Watch this film, and these film makers, closely. Neither will disappoint.	Brutally violent and shockingly funny in equal measure, Blood Simple offers early evidence of the Coen Brothers' twisted sensibilities and filmmaking ingenuity.
New leading man Steve Carell is charming, even when burdened with long white hair and huge beard, not to speak of company of creatures of every size, but the ultra-expensive comedy is too conceptual and overproduced and only intermittently funny.	Apparently all the money went into the animals. The jokes wouldn't earn a round of applause at open mic night at your local comedy club.	Richly mixes funny, supernatural, and heart. A film the whole family can enjoy, as evidenced by my happy clan of four ranging in age from seven to sixty-seven.	A soggy mess...To think it's any good would require a supreme act of faith.	Don't bother going down with the ark; skip this one.	Big on special effects but short on laughs, Evan Almighty underutilizes a star-studded cast that includes Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman.
At times, it verges on being overbearing, too much to watch -- and yet you can't turn your eyes away for fear of missing whatever excruciatingly awkward moment might come next.	This hilarious, high-kicking nonsense cost two cents and looks it -- hell, it was shot in 19 days, but you'll laugh helplessly anyway.	My tolerance for the mockumentary form of comedy has curdled somewhat in the wake of the past decade's serious subgenre overkill.	A very cool comedy based on character -- real, and really self-deluded characters -- and not on shtick.	This is a really small film, shot in 19 days, and it's a little rough around the edges, but it's got a huge comic heart that's undeniable.	The rough edges and biting humor of this martial arts comedy will keep audiences laughing and cringing in turns.
A celebration of craft, graft and inspiration, The Wind Rises is a final masterpiece from an industry legend - and a ballsy statement that animated wonder needn't be confined to genre ghettos.	An emotionally generous and expansively detailed romantic fantasy.	It is not enchanting or charming enough to be recommended, and its story and characters are less engaging compared to the memorably colorful or complex characters we encountered in [Miyazaki's] other works.	The life, work, and love story of an aviation engineer in Japan prior to World War II directed by Hayao Miyazaki.	If this indeed is Miyazaki's last feature film, he's certainly flying out on a high note. (Full Content Review for Parents also available here)	The Wind Rises is a fittingly bittersweet swan song for director Hayao Miyazaki.
Whatever one ends up thinking about The Snowtown Murders, it's difficult to deny that it's a deeply impressive work.	A cast of mostly local, mostly first-time film actors is chillingly convincing.	Snowtown offers a bleak, brutal exploration of the way morality can be skewed and innocence corrupted by neglect, hardship ... and the presence of a charismatic psychopath.	The entire large cast -- many of them local first-timers -- are superbly believable.	A mildly intriguing, yet ultimately detached and pitiless portrait of psychopathy.	It's a bleak and brutal endurance test, but for viewers with the strength and patience to make it to the end, Snowtown will prove an uncommonly powerful viewing experience.
Between the opening salvo and the equally staggering finale is a dull, dour drama that drains the movie of nearly all its exuberance.	Lacks the old-school charm of films like Wild Style and Breakin'.	Unleashes one dazzling routine after another.	Shoddily written and directed.	Rarely do you encounter a movie without a shred of originality. You Got Served is such a cinematic vacuum.	The dance sequences are exhilarating, but everything else about this movie is sloppy and generic.
The only problem is that there's just not that much of a reason to sit up and check out what all of the noise is about.	Vigorously pushes the supernatural line throughout, but unfortunately its final movement is so incoherent that the whole thing collapses.	For [Keaton], a forgettable flick like this one is like a rehab stint in A ball for a big league pitcher	[Keaton's] being stalked by three shadowy figures that ... look exactly like the Penn-Robbins-Bacon silhouettes that graced the poster for Mystic River.	Egad! Is it too early to start assembling my Worst Pictures of 2005 list?	While there are some built-in scares, the movie is muddled and unsatisfying.
A stunning, harsh drama that lingers in the memory because of its cruel strokes.	Kathy Bates brilliantly portrays Annie as someone with absolutely no sense of her own monstrosity.	A quality film of suspense and manipulation.	Among other things, Misery emerges as a great picture of fan obsession, and of that curious mix of hero-worship and hero-bashing personified in supermarket tabloids and trash TV.	Left the cinema, went home, changed pants. Let's leave at that, okay?	Elevated by standout performances from James Caan and Kathy Bates, this taut and frightening film is one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date.
Easily the best superhero film since "Batman Begins," which for my money is the best in the genre.	A witty and dapper speeding bullet of a film, able to appeal to nerds and civilians alike.	Director Jon Favreau displays the same wonderment and control over visual effects as he did in 2005's underrated "Zathura." Excepting a clunky prologue and escape sequence, it's a flawlessly paced origin story with humor, smarts and soul.	The key, of course, is Downey, who effortlessly conveys that his newfound sense of responsibility isn't going to stop him from having a good time, and in doing so, Iron Man makes saving the world look like fun again.	You can enjoy Iron Man (under two hours, if you skip the credits) without being one.	Director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey Jr. make this smart, high impact superhero movie one that even non-comics fans can enjoy.
Writer/director Sebastián Silva uses a documentary shooting style that works to create an intimate, slightly unsettling portrait of a domestic on the edge.	What might have been a condescending social-issue drama about oppressed servants or a shrill send-up of the ruling class instead becomes a carefully etched character study.	It isn't until late in the game that audiences will be able to determine the extent of the picture's darker undertones.	The Maid has that particular gift of leaving you off balance in the best possible way, and whenever something like that comes around you owe it to yourself to check it out.	Chilean television vet Saavedra goes through one of the most uncanny psychophysical transformations I've ever seen in a movie without the benefit of obvious makeup or other prosthetics.	Catalina Saavedra's devastating performance would be reason enough to see The Maid, but Sebastian Silva's empathetic direction and finely tuned script only add to the movie's pleasing heft.
Brad Anderson's stylish and original romantic comedy features a wonderful performance from Hope Davis.	Slight as it is, Wonderland charms.	Next Stop, Wonderland isn't really much more than a beautifully acted, finely edited sitcom, but it creates and sustains an intelligent, seriocomic mood better than any recent film about the urban single life.	Brad Anderson was so enamored of the parallel-story device that he lost sight of the fact that BOTH stories need to be good	Wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of Domino sugar cubes falling on top of you.	Endearing performances create characters you care about.
A modern classic that stays true to private eye-movie conventions while digging way, way, deep underneath them.	classic noir	Beyond all the "masterpiece" rhetoric, this is actually a great movie.	Unmissable.	one of the great masterworks of '70s American cinema and an apex of the decade's obsession with genre revisionism	As bruised and cynical as the decade that produced it, this noir classic benefits from Robert Towne's brilliant screenplay, director Roman Polanski's steady hand, and wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway.
King Kong light. Insipid Joe Young. Just because this film is rated PG doesn't mean it has to be written on the level of an orangutan.	So slavishly formulaic, so deprived of an any inspiration of any kind, that it very well could have been written by a monkey.	A family film about the heroics of a gorilla trying to stay alive in the face of human greed and violence.	The filmmakers forgot about the adults who pay to bring the target audience to the multiplex.	Never get into a movie where you play opposite an animal, right? They should have listened.	Beguiling effects transcend a predictable plot.
Angelina Jolie evokes every parent's worst nightmare, and provides a career defining performance while doing so.	Changeling is a pretty good Lifetime Original Movie. But it's a far cry from Clint Eastwood's best films.	While the neo-Gothic tale is inherently intriguing, the film should inspire strong emotion, but deliberate pacing and a contained sense of melodrama make it a surprisingly passive experience.	Stranger than fiction %u2026. and more powerful for it	What, you may ask, is a "Changeling?"	Beautifully shot and well-acted, Changeling is a compelling story that unfortunately gives in to convention too often.
You want to admire the technical achievement, except it never feels like a technical achievement. It just feels like you're there. And desperately want to leave.	A technical and storytelling masterpiece buoyed by stunning visuals and functioning both as a ripping, tension-filled yarn and as a profound and life-affirming work of art.	As Cuarón spells out in his intro: "Life in space is impossible". So is forming any emotional attachment to Gravity.	Created through a painstaking combination of physical and digital performance that disintegrates the divide between live action and animation, Gravity boasts a level of sheer visual invention that would have left Stanley Kubrick's head spinning.	With nothingness pressing in on all sides, in a place where the grip of someone else's hand is all that keeps you from the void, life really does seem like a miracle.	Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity is an eerie, tense sci-fi thriller that's masterfully directed and visually stunning.
Dreamcatcher is a serviceable action-horror-sci-fi flick much of the time, but it has a bit too much going on for any of it to have real impact.	There's nothing epic here, just lots of constant viscera ground out over a bruising two plus hours.	De acordo com os produtores, Stephen King pediu apenas um dуlar para ceder os direitos de adaptaзгo de O Apanhador de Sonhos. A julgar-se pelo resultado final, ele cobrou caro demais.	It's the kind of story that probably would have worked better as a four-hour miniseries.	A simplified, truncated mess.	An incoherent and overly long creature feature.
A welcome act of artistic lunacy and a messy masterpiece that deserves a life well beyond the current awards season.	"The New World" is a movie that promises to leave its viewers with a bigger headache than you'd get contemplating the current state of global affairs.	... a film that flows like a great symphony, that sweeps you into its meditative current and guides you toward one epiphany after another.	The New World is a work of breathtaking imagination, less a movie than a mode of transport, and in every sense a masterpiece.	Malick comes out with a movie about once every ten years, but I think I've had about enough. You can keep him.	Despite arresting visuals and strong lead performances, The New World suffers from an unfocused narrative that will challenge viewers' attention spans over its 2 1/2 hours.
Anything could have happened. The unthinkable often did. And Selma depicts it all with a gripping, majestic flourish that feels just right.	It's a movie, yes. But this stirring account of the fight to end racially motivated voting impediments in the Deep South is more than anything a much-needed wake-up call for a country that has seriously lost its way in terms of equality.	This is lucid in its political analysis and sobering in its depictions of racially motivated violence, though it sometimes comes off as stolid.	Selma achieves the rare accolade of being a powerful period piece with stark contemporary resonance.	More often than not ... "Selma" focuses on the one thing we don't expect in a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. - his doubts - and Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and quite brilliant performance.	Fueled by a gripping performance from David Oyelowo, Selma draws inspiration and dramatic power from the life and death of Martin Luther King, Jr. -- but doesn't ignore how far we remain from the ideals his work embodied.
A flea-bitten farrago which bears only a fleeting resemblance to the 1959 film that inspired it.	The Shaggy Dog is a well-dispositioned but forgettable mutt without any new tricks.	Ranks as one of Disney's weakest theatrical releases in years. Woof, indeed.	This remake is heavy on the special effects...but the biggest difference is how the film becomes another commentary on the lamentable state of today's parents.	A mongrel marriage of frantic physical farce and sub-standard CGI work that turns out vaguely creepy rather than cute.	This Disney retread has neither inspiration nor originality, but may please moviegoers under the age of ten.
Few recent movies have been this perceptive about such immediate human conflicts, much less this funny.	Brief, brutal and barmy.	Given the Oscar pedigree of the people who made it, one can't be blamed for expecting a bit more from it, but there's definite value here, particularly in a pair of great performances.	Even as it successfully evokes the single location as a pressure cooker for heightened behavior, its take on the psychological and emotional side effects of such an airless situation never transcends the obvious.	Drives home an oft-observed truth with wit and style. It's thin, but then so is a knife between your ribs.	It isn't as compelling on the screen as it was on the stage, but Carnage makes up for its flaws with Polanski's smooth direction and assured performances from Winslet and Foster.
A goofy, stylish heist movie that'll steal moviegoers from other pictures as surely as Danny Ocean and his dirty dozen will get their hands on the Fabergé egg they've decided to filch.	A fun-filled, mind-twisting romp featuring a cast that obviously had just as much fun making the film as the audience does watching it.	We love these people like family, because they joke and whine and screw up just like our best friends would if our best friends were stealing $200 million.	The movie is fun in the way reading Us Weekly is fun, except that it takes longer to get through.	Ocean's Twelve is clearly the work of filmmakers and stars who have come to play. It's not art and it's not substantive, but it sure is a blast.	While some have found the latest star-studded heist flick to be a fun, glossy star vehicle, others declare it's lazy, self-satisfied and illogical.
If not for some hopelessly incompetent and wasted attempts to lighten the mood... it might well be able to compete with Beauty and the Beast as the best film of the Disney Renaissance.	The Hunchback's message -- that beauty is only skin deep -- goes only so far.	This is pretty sophisticated for so-called kid stuff.	Weak.	There is much to admire in Hunchback, not least the risk of doing such a downer of a story at all.	Disney's take on the Victor Hugo classic is dramatically uneven, but its strong visuals, dark themes, and message of tolerance make for a more-sophisticated-than-average children's film.
The Real Dirt on Farmer John turns into a portrait of how American family farming could blossom for a new century.	At times, the film plays like an extended infomercial for John's new company, Angelic Organics, but the agrarian fantasy is so compelling here that the revitalization of the American family farm begins to seem not just possible, but probable.	Like its title character, The Real Dirt on Farmer John is a simple, effective movie with a lot on its mind.	Don't be surprised if, by the finish, you wind up fantasizing about your own rural homestead.	It's fascinating that this portrait of the rise, fall and rise of Midwestern organic farmer John Peterson can be read in so many different ways, only some of which appear intentionally in Taggart Siegel's sympathetic documentary.	Ostensibly a bio about an eccentric farmer, The Real Dirt on Farmer John also doubles as a stirring exploration of man's common struggle with loss and prejudice.
Everything about this subtly directed drama enhances its pathos and humor.	All three actresses are wonderful, but the picture belongs to the commanding Gorintin.	If you want a film whose ending is happy and sad at the same time look no further.	The kind of small film ... that expands our understanding of the emotional economy of family life, with its ebb and flow of love and hostility, secrecy and egregious candor.	La principal fortaleza del film, además de la atenta mirada y la sensibilidad de Bertuccelli, es ese impecable trío de actrices.	A drama that's both funny and moving.
Yes, there are the usual lessons learned, but the movie also speaks the truth about kids who need to lash out but only end up harming each other and themselves.	Absorbing and occasionally disturbing film.	It begins to feel a little like one of those made-for-TV, issue-of-the-week melodramas Linda Blair used to star in.	The movie works only to the extent you get involved with each kid's efforts or inability to adjust to the traumas of his past.	Spoiled adolescents fill a mental institution with whining, pouting, and tantrums, and we're supposed to feel their pain.	A grim drama about emotionally damaged teens, Manic's solid cast helps to elevate the material above cliche.
Pour Elle is a smart, startling thriller; a perfect date movie for couples who like to smoke afterwards.	An efficient, highly polished potboiler that rattles along without permitting the viewer any time to ponder the implausible plot.	Prepare to gnaw you knuckles to the bone with this nerve-shredding French thriller that poses the question: How far would you go for a loved one?	Cavayé's film may not be the cleverest or most credible but it packs an effective punch.	This French thriller hurtles along with hardly a pause.	This taut and snappy French prison break thriller may be suspiciously implausible, but is held together by two fine central performances.
If the current legroom in economy class doesn't make you resent the birth of the Wright Brothers, Flyboys certainly will. Like a flight from New York to Los Angeles, it's bad and it's long.	Flyboys is schlock. It's structure is predictable: comic moments, followed by an action sequence -- good from a distance, but as soon as we're too close to the pilots, everyone just looks ridiculous.	The creators of Flyboys know no image too clichéd, no narrative convention too exhausted and no psychological motivation too pat that it can't do service.	An embarrassing cliché-fest.	Chop at least half an hour off the running time by deleting the totally unnecessary and yawn-inducing love story and Flyboys wouldn't be half-bad.	A poorly scripted history-rewriting exercise with mediocre acting and unconvincing CGI battle scenes.
The film is surprisingly good. The screenplay is intelligent, inventive and always interesting. The dialogue is keen and the characters are well developed and three-dimensional.	Outstanding drama about morals and our choices.	Quiz Show' is a uniquely American tragedy, told with subtlety and complexity.	Perfectly pitched, the film brims with insight and wit. Highly recommended.	Crisply directed by Redford from a thought-provoking script by Paul Attanasio, and featuring a slew of strong performances.	Robert Redford refracts the sociopolitical and moral issues posed by the subject material through a purely entertaining, well-acted lens.
Like its title characters -- squid-like aliens who encroach on our ecosystems -- Monsters represents a kind of encroachment of kitchen-table filmmaking on Hollywood's turf.	McNairy and Able are stick figures who spend all their screen time spouting risible platitudes about how America sure looks different when you see it from the other side of a wall.	A uniquely satisfying entertainment.	Atmospheric and inventive. A little indie worth looking for.	I suspect writer/director/producer/effects designer/cinematographer/production designer Gareth Edwards is aware he has bitten off more than he could possibly chew...	It doesn't quite live up to its intriguing premise, but Monsters is a surprising blend of alien-invasion tropes, political themes, and relationship drama.
A wonderfully crafted movie that has the resourcefulness to encourage Holly Hunter to dance, Danny DeVito to sing, and Queen Latifah to act.	... there is always a market for these kid of sleek, superficial movies about the redemptive power of being true to your own nature	The smooth, soothing soundtrack could not be a better fit for the laid-back, low-key, unforced appeal of the film.	LaGravenese the director seems less sure of himself than LaGravenese the writer, resorting to occasional gimmicky touches that dilute the moods and meanings for which he's striving.	... made up of magical moments of revelation that are the film's strength as well as its ultimate weakness.	Unoriginal, with one-dimensional characters.
A hectic and labored attempt to supply the boy who never grew up with an origin story.	It reminds me most of Sylvain Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville. It's great.	Let's not mince words: This movie stinks.	The official worst-ever Peter Pan film adaptation of any sort. And that includes "Hook."	Tasked to come up with any sort of backstory to get us to the flying and the crowing and the Lost Boys and the never growing up, Pan goes with what has become default fantasy template No. 1.	Pan finds a few bursts of magic in its prequel treatment of classic characters, though not enough to offset the rushed plot and shrill, CGI-fueled action.
It was much more thought-provoking than I was expecting, but his blatant bias made me feel that he was no less a fundamentalist than the religious people he was criticising.	It's sharp and outrageously funny enough to keep it from coming off like a self-righteous screed and to keep Maher from looking like the Michael Moore of religion -- for the most part.	Maher understands this fine line, but in his comedic zeal, he sometimes forgets and steps wrong.	It's a nasty, condescending, small-minded film, self-amused and ultimately self-defeating. Its only accomplishment is to make atheists look bad -- and in this political climate they didn't need Maher's help with that.	A refreshingly courageous and long overdue lecture that is equally enlightening, entertaining and provocative.	Religulous is funny and offensive in equal measure, and aims less to change hearts and minds than to inspire conversation.
Hitchcock classic	After half a century of terror, Psycho is still ensuring that no one feels safe in the shower.	Psycho is not a long film but it feels long. Perhaps because the director dawdles over technical effects; perhaps because it is difficult, if not impossible, to care about any of the characters.	You can bet that everyone who's ever seen it immediately feels their heart start to pound when they're in the shower and hear someone enter the bathroom.	...more than the great granddaddy of all slasher films; it is a great thriller, a great black comedy, and a lesson in filmmaking.	Infamous for its shower scene, but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre. Because Psycho was filmed with tact, grace, and art, Hitchcock didn't just create modern horror, he validated it.
It certainly won't be everyone's cup of breakfast bitters, but you can't dismiss it nonchalantly.	It frustratingly refuses to go bonkers, but the film is a compelling sit, brought to life by two very crafty, pointed performances.	An exceedingly odd meeting of the minds (and bodies) occurs in Quid Pro Quo, a strikingly original and provocative first feature from scribe-helmer Carlos Brooks.	I wanted Quid Pro Quo to develop into something at every turn, but it just never gels. It's a great 20-page short story that can't sustain 82 minutes of life on the big screen.	Brooks tiptoes into territory Luis Bunuel would have frolicked in, but he does so without the master surrealist's desire to outrage and confound his viewers.	Despite a stunning performance by Vera Farmiga, Quid Pro Quo never develops its effective parts into a convincing whole.
SPOCK: 'Logic dictates we include all the ingredients which have proved popular in our earlier films. Data indicates that one crucial element is what humans call 'tongue-in-cheek' humor; in-jokes about previous episodes, self-mocking references, etc.'	The original crew at its finest, and the Trek lore at its most thrilling.	[The movie] realises that its strength lies in our familiarity with the characters by now and exploits this cleverly -- particularly in scenes where the crew must unearth traitors in their midst almost like in a Agatha Christie detective story.	Weighed down by a midsection even flabbier than the long-in-the-tooth cast, director Nicholas Meyer still delivers enough of what Trek auds hunger for to justify the trek to the local multiplex.	The original cast go out with a bang.	The Undiscovered Country is a strong cinematic send-off for the original Trek crew, featuring some remarkable visuals and an intriguing, character-driven mystery plot.
A psychologically thrilling movie that leaves you gasping in the end.	1408 is one of the good Stephen King adaptations, one that maintains its author's sly sense of humor and satiric view of human nature.	The movie attempts a false ending that doesn't quite work; the picture feels prolonged, dragged out, and its ennui lessens the impact of some of its more terrifying fillips.	Another actor may have made 1408 seem as thin and fake as an episode of Tales from the Crypt, but Cusack lends it that badly needed extra milligram of conviction.	...one of the most gleefully loony things you'll see this year.	Relying on psychological tension rather than overt violence and gore, 1408 is a genuinely creepy thriller with a strong lead performance by John Cusack.
For all the Oscar buzz surrounding Heath Ledger in the past few weeks, there still aren't enough hours in the day to gush about his knockout performance as The Joker.	The stunts are exciting, but here's an action movie where the bits in between feel like more than setup for the next set piece. We've seen Bat movies that wink, sink or stink; this one thinks.	Heath Ledger's Joker is, in many ways, symbolic of Nolan's overall success with The Dark Knight; subtle and restrained, but always two shakes shy of bloody holocaust and a masterpiece of cinema that time will verify.	The Dark Knight is a brilliant follow-up to Batman Begins	A stupendous performance by the late Heath Ledger burns this incarnation of The Joker into our psyche as securely as did Jack Nicholson's. But even more than Nicholson, Ledger plays The Joker for real..	Dark, complex and unforgettable, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.
"Agora" occasionally hints at the interesting material embedded in its central conceits, but never manages to enliven it.	Amenabar's efforts to align the era's religious conflicts and culture wars with those of our own become thuddingly obvious, especially once the old-school brio of Agora's first hour has gone the way of the Roman Empire.	For all of the massive sets and overstated rumination on the design of the universe, "Agora" is film that fails at every step to be believable.	Agora feels like an overlong school trip to the planetarium, followed by a Romans-in-togas play in the gym.	Earnest but dull, Agora is about the clash of science and religion, but the filmmaking elements never quite create the necessary sparks.	Noble goals and a gripping performance from Rachel Weisz can't save Agora from its muddled script, uneven acting, and choppy editing.
It may be rated G, but for the most part this is serious stuff, as potentially traumatic for younger viewers as the death of Bambi's mother.	A formulaically entertaining combination of gorgeous cinematography and unapologetic anthropomorphization.	Bears is entertaining, suitably suspenseful, and amusing, boosted by Reilly's enthusiasm and the natural appeal of its stars.	The "nature" aspects of Bears are undercut by the need to turn this into a live-action Disney cartoon, complete with cuddly heroes and nasty villains.	As with Fothergill's previous nature documentaries, "Bears" is a story of triumph and family.	Sweet, beautifully filmed, and admirably short on sugarcoating, Bears continues Disneynature's winning streak.
Director Tony Scott got the tone, atmosphere, and grime of the story right.	Spy Game is absorbing enough for a night out, yet the film never pretends to be more than a lavishly downbeat popcorn thriller.	A yawn, and the two glamour boys (who, by the way, look awful) are both snoring.	This movie is about guys sitting around in meetings, trying to out-spy each other.	Those flashbacks tend to dissipate tension and interest rather than increase it, making Spy Game play more like a haphazard short-story collection than an involving and cohesive novel.	The outcome of the kinetic Spy Game is never in doubt, but it is fun watching Robert Redford and Brad Pitt work.
'The Eye' could be worth seeing as a matinee or rental.	The overall visual imagery is terrifically effective, unsettling and eerie, yet darkly beautiful at the same time.	In their fluid, deliciously eerie imagery, the Pangs can make the sight of even a dish of sliced duck in a busy noodle shop seem as ominous as the chilling, blurry specters that only Mun can see.	Although I have mixed feelings about The Eye, there's no question the Pangs have a natural talent for cinema.	[The Pangs'] sense of pacing is nicely arrhythmic, which makes the 'boo' moments all the more heart-thudding, but what's even more pleasurable are the pockets of quiet, those lacuna of low-frequency dread when nothing much happens.	Conventional ghost tale with a few genuine scares.
Despite some massive flaws and a disappointing over-reliance on jump scares, The Unborn is comfortably the best entry yet from Platinum Dunes, Michael Bay's previously remake-happy horror production outfit.	Unoriginal, unbelievable, utterly unwatchable.	Before long, the connective tissue between scares starts to call attention to its own preposterousness.	What The Unborn represents manages to be a thousand times more disturbing than anything Goyer captured with his pen or camera	The Unborn is, like its main character, at war with itself. Neither side wins.	David Goyer's Unborn is a tame genre effort with cheap thrills and scares that border on silliness.
Pointedly strange and whimsical, O'Horten mixes the surreal with the mundane in its depiction of the retirement and eventual rebirth of a train engineer.	If you can settle into [Baard Owe's] playful deadpan rhythms, a bittersweetly funny, existential mystery -- or call it a modest adventure, if that's not too oxymoronic -- awaits.	Thanks to the consistent deadpan tone that Hamer and Owe establish, it's oddly satisfying.	Strangeness, humor and melancholy of aging are deftly explored.	Humor doesn't get much drier...this may be the most quietly funny film since Hamer's Kitchen Stories.	Bent Hamer's latest is a droll, deadpan comedy filled with strange touches and melancholy charm.
Aan enjoyable movie for the entire family to see.	Tarzan is a cut above new-generation Disney animated movies for many reasons, but one is clearly the story's emotional resonance.	Tarzan offers glimpses of Disney emotional storytelling at its finest.	Travels light, moves quickly and leaves very little in its wake.	The first half of Tarzan is Disney's best stuff since Beauty and the Beast ... [then it] declines into a typical showdown with a forgettable villain.	Disney's Tarzan takes the well-known story to a new level with spirited animation, a brisk pace, and some thrilling action set-pieces..
If you've always wanted to hear inanimate objects argue with each other in the personas of Cranky Jewish Guy and Sassy Black Woman, this is a dream come true.	The opportunity to talk to the kids who see this little film about the Reeves' story -- a real-life triumph of inspiration over tragedy -- is perhaps the best tribute to the couple this film provides.	The movie means well and, like tee ball, it's probably best suited for the littlest kids only.	A sweet but very forgettable animated adventure.	I can't say Everyone's Hero strikes out -- it might distract little kids for a while -- but the directors needn't bother practicing their home run trots.	Everyone's Hero is such a predictable and bland tale that it'll appeal mostly to little kids; others seeking something in Pixar's league are looking in the wrong ballpark.
The 20-minute closing duel may just be the best kung-fu battle ever filmed.	This is the weakest of the many Chan chop-shticks to make it to this country.	Anita Mui all but pulls a heist herself in every scene she's in, but make no mistake. This is Chan's movie, and he holds his own, whether it's using his comedic talents to feign drunkenness or strike a goofy face, or showing off those impressive martial a	This imported and dubbed Jackie Chan fossil might be a kick for diehard fans, but most will be left feeling high and dry.	Jackie Chan movies are popcorn: light, devoid of nutritional value, something you can gobble for 90 minutes without filling up.	Jackie Chan sends up some amazing and entertaining fight sequences in The Legend of Drunken Master.
It's well known that writer/director Kurt Wimmer hates movie critics. Ultraviolet is the reason why.	The repetition of the action scenes play like an avant-garde joke about the indistinguishable nature of Hollywood fight scenes. Think Warhol's soup cans, only with actors posing with swords.	Ultraviolet cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly.	... feels incomplete, as though the production ran out of time, money, or both.	It's a banner year for bad vampire flicks, so Ultraviolet is truly damned by this faint praise: It's not the worst.	An incomprehensible and forgettable sci-fi thriller, Ultraviolet is inept in every regard.
This isn't the first "body swap" movie ever made.	Tween audiences may be susceptible to Zac Efron's smile and basketball skills but I'm sure their adult guardians will wonder what all the fuss is about.	You know those movies that look like they're going to be really insipid and then completely surprise you? 17 Again isn't one of those.	Derivative to be sure, but smarter and funnier than expected with some good life lessons along the way.	Nothing new here.	Though it uses a well-worn formula, 17 Again has just enough Zac Efron charm to result in a harmless, pleasurable teen comedy.
... the film's emotional message and expanded viewpoint serve as a fitting tribute to the young men trapped in these all too true events.	Fails to bring as much to the table.	... Wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie, balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving War Department telegrams.	We Were Soldiers depicts the horrors of war, but also highlights the families of those soldiers fighting in battle.	... A fitting tribute to all the men and women who have fought and died for their country -- and for each other.	The war cliches are laid on a bit thick, but the movie succeeds at putting a human face on soldiers of both sides in the Vietnam War.
A omething of a disappointment. The initially fascinating, ambiguous relationship between the two young women is overwhelmed by the hysteria spawned by her unflaggingly intense presence at the monastery	Endlessly compelling and thought-provoking throughout its entire running time, even when it plunges the darkest, bleakest depths of human nature.	Beyond the Hills' undercurrents prove more interesting than its storyline or characters.	Mungiu's quietly gripping film challenges expectations, refusing to merely lay forth an argument against benighted religion or to make Alina a simple victim.	Mungiu works in long takes and at a measured pace, burying the story's true-crime origins for half the film's two-and-a-half-hour length.	Although some viewers may mistake its deliberate pace for passionless filmmaking, Beyond the Hills offers an intelligent, powerfully acted examination of the tension between secular life and religious faith.
Many talented people, but especially Christian Bale are short-changed by his clouded vision. The brightly glaring digital photography doesn't help, but in the end the worst crime is that the story is just plain dull.	Director Michael Mann is a stylish, brooding perfectionist who makes movies about men who are stylish, brooding perfectionists.	Thrilling, glamorous, richly textured and breathlessly action-packed, it is one of the best movies of the year.	What's dismaying about Public Enemies, over and beyond the unintelligibility of much of the dialogue and the sliminess of its digital sheen, is that it has no sense of why it's been made.	Frequently taut but ultimately unsatisfying.	Michael Mann's latest is a competent and technically impressive gangster flick with charismatic lead performances, but some may find the film lacks truly compelling drama.
Splice teases us with greatness before settling in as a messy, but never dull, sci-fi thriller	The film's deliberately provocative premise is worked out in broad, lurid comic-book strokes, consciously calculated to shock the easily shockable and titillate the peculiar.	Its sensibilities echo those of David Cronenberg, another Canadian who knew how to mix sly humor with queasy body horror.	It's certainly not for all tastes, but it's a legitimate horror movie -- it really does raise prickly questions about modern DNA science, and its psychosexual component is anything but gratuitous.	an intelligent horror film that chips away at the emotions and the intellect without compromise and without respite	It doesn't take its terrific premise quite as far as it should, but Splice is a smart, well-acted treat for horror fans.
Cat fanciers and adventure lovers will like Duma, an engaging story of a boy and his cheetah.	Director Carroll Ballard makes only one type of movie -- family adventures that feature some sort of wildlife. To his credit, however, he does them pretty well.	Carroll Ballard still works in his ravishing, nearly pointillistic style of organic visual splendor.	It's as good as this sort of thing gets, and deserves to be seen in a proper auditorium rather than on DVD.	The awww factor of these sequences is huge -- and undeniable.	This is an old-fashioned, richly textured family film that will appeal to children and adults alike.
Audiard's sensationally directed set pieces and the quietly compelling performance by Rahim hold interest throughout	The film is a ferocious coming-of-age tale beginning with the arrival of 19-year-old Malik El Djebena (French-Algerian Tahar Rahim, who recalls the beautiful ruffians of Caravaggio) in a hard-core French prison.	A stunning cinematic experience.	A Prophet is a compelling piece of naturalistic filmmaking, claustrophobic and thought-provoking.	It's not an easy film to watch. But some very strong performances and some smart material certainly help.	Featuring an impressive star turn by newcomer Tahar Rahim, A Prophet is a French gangster film filled with arresting, immediate details.
Directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush explore the surprisingly difficult obstacles to ending a situation where about 1 child out of 4 faces insecurity over where to get a meal.	A good documentary that is good for you.	Tthe strongest point made by the film is that hunger is a problem endemic to our social system, and it's a problem that will not be served up in a soup line, one meal at a time.	Through their stories, Jacobson and Silverbush lens a broader picture of rampant hunger in a country that actually produces astounding amounts of food.	Impassioned doc examines the reemergence of widespread hunger in U.S.	A Place at the Table is a well-reported documentary that raises important questions about the state of hunger in America culture.
This romantic fable, starring again the Eel's central couple, with strong meythical and sexual overtones, represents one of the Japanese master's lightest films.	A comedy that is warm, inviting, and surprising.	Like its bizarre heroine, it irrigates our souls.	Veteran director Imamura combines fish out of water stories with a weird metaphor for female sexuality in this sweetly quirky film which never quite gels	Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable, Warm Water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy.	A whimsically engaging sex comedy.
A pleasant enough -- if slight -- comedy.	Thankfully, this film is grounded and has a firm sense of reality and is consequently more affecting for it.	Without a doubt Hugh Grant's finest on-screen performance to date.	Some credit for that deservedly goes to Grant. To his credit, he doesn't stoop to his puppy-dog pander.	Fans of the old rakishly seductive womaniser may have their allegiance strained... But I think [Grant] passes the test triumphantly.	A winning comedy that benefits from Hugh Grant's boyish charms.
The message, I guess, is that incarceration dehumanises both prisoner and guards alike. Here it also serves to exasperate audiences.	Regardless of politics, one must grant McQueen's substantial gifts, which bring to mind Paul Greengrass in another Northern Ireland film, Bloody Sunday.	McQueen's film is not so much an attempt to reopen old wounds as a cinematic portrait of the wound itself, a visceral embodiment of politics at the very cellular level of those who engage in it.	Fassbender's commitment to the role is astounding.	Whatever your opinion, there is no denying McQueen packs more powerful imagery into his feature-length debut than most directors manage in a lifetime.	Unflinching, uncompromising, vivid and vital, Steve McQueen's challenging debut is not for the faint hearted, but it's still a richly rewarding retelling of troubled times.
Entertaining and revelatory as it is, the docu raises questions of any work that's authorized version, and there's also the issue of context, as it depicts the fashion magazine two years ago and so much has changed since then.	seems already dated	A far better watch than it probably has any right to be. The audience that dreams of being supermodels or wants to see powerful women at the center of their own universe is a vast one, and in the right hands this movie could do measurable business.	A fascinating, frustrating documentary.	A sleek, very entertaining documentary.	This doc about the making of Vogue's biggest issue and its frosty editor-in-chief is fascinating eye candy and light-on-its-feet fun.
Pale Rider does nothing to disprove the wisdom that this genre is best left to the revival houses. A double feature of Shane and Eastwood's High Plains Drifter will do just fine, thanks.	It had been so long since a quality western had hit America's screens that it appears as if Eastwood purposely set out to remind audiences of all the elements that make the genre work.	It's good to be back in the saddle again.	A severely underrated western, one of Eastwood's most stylish.	It's a lightweight, easygoing affair, reminiscent of some of Hawks' or Ford's lesser Westerns.	Nearly a decade after The Outlaw Josey Wales, Clint Eastwood returns as a director to the genre that made his name with this elegant, spiritual Western that riffs on the classic Shane.
Polanski simply transfers Harris' undistinguished prose direct to the screen and, though the pace picks up marginally in the second half, there's little wow factor in the revelations as they appear.	I would not put the narrative conceit The Ghost Writer perpetrates in its final moments past a doped up high school sophomore in a screenwriting elective.	Polanski infuses the action with the quality of a waking nightmare. He has the capacity to take a simple shot of a ship coming into harbor and give it a feeling of foreboding.	The Greyscale Adventures Of Tony Blair: SuperSpy (as I call it) is a deliberately directed, well acted and classy treatment of a plot that is so balls-out ridiculous I firmly believe the writer wears a tin-foil hat.	[Polanski has a] knack for taking pulp and transforming it into tense, paranoid drama.	While it may lack the revelatory punch of Polanski's finest films, Ghost Writer benefits from stylish direction, a tense screenplay, and a strong central performance from Ewan McGregor.
One of the most luminous experiences you will have in a movie theater.	One of those seminal works without which modern movies wouldn't exist...	Sunrise is often rightfully noted for its technical achievements but what is often overlooked is its emotional power.	One of the last great silent movies.	An example of True Love styled to cinema perfection.	Boasting masterful cinematography to match its well-acted, wonderfully romantic storyline, Sunrise is perhaps the final -- and arguably definitive -- statement of the silent era.
Ian McKellen shines in this well-acted drama about a mysterious Hollywood celebrity.	McKellen's performance borders on brilliance.	Whale, always the aesthete and snob, comments to an interviewer that the other Frankenstein films were done by hacks.	An engrossing, unusual, imaginatively executed bit of psychological gamesmanship ...	A parable worthy of Mary Shelley herself.	Gods and Monsters is a spellbinding, confusing piece of semi-fiction, featuring fine performances; McKellen leads the way, but Redgrave and Fraser don't lag far behind.
The script is very good in convincingly portraying the way the teammates learn to trust one another, overcome their prejudices and even laugh at the absurdity of racism.	A stirring and gratifying 'true story' which nonetheless plays like it was written by a computer and directed by someone consulting an instruction manual before every take.	A well-packaged, well-acted, well-intentioned feel good movie that brings nothing new to the table yet still manages to pull you into its wonderful world of harmony.	Boorish and flatulent.	Too bad the rest of the film isn't up to the exacting standards of its lead actors.	An inspirational crowd-pleaser with a healthy dose of social commentary, Remember the Titans may be predictable, but it's also well-crafted and features terrific performances.
National Lampoon recycles countless collegiate comedies for this spin-off sequel.	Everything old is old again in this rickety extension of 2002's already rickety Van Wilder.	The question comes to mind: How do you make a Van Wilder movie without Van Wilder? The answer, after watching the end result, is you don't. Or at least you shouldn't.	Screw Tara Reid! Who needs her in this movie. We've got a cockney girl with huge knockers.	Penn sports little of the squirrelly charm evidenced by the original Van Wilder star, Ryan Reynolds.	A low-brow comedy, minus the comedy.
A Mighty Wind might look like a PBS documentary shown during pledge month, but it's actually one of the brightest comedies we're likely to see this year.	Both the closest Guest has come to true satire and his most emotionally satisfying effort to date.	It's not that A Mighty Wind isn't funny. It is. But it's also amazingly insubstantial. Five minutes after it's over, it begins to evaporate. And it doesn't help that Wind breaks (oh, come on, you couldn't have resisted either) no new ground.	It's wonderfully funny, but in a quiet way; inspiring helpless giggles rather than knee-slapping and aisle-rolling. And, for the record, it's even better on a second viewing.	In this hilarious, pitch-perfect comedy, Guest and his longtime collaborator, co-writer and star Eugene Levy, have the quaint, golly-gee enthusiasm of folkies and their music in the cross-hairs.	Though not as uproariously funny as Guest's previous movies, A Mighty Wind is also more heartfelt.
If through some incredible chance you haven't [seen it], all I can say is: do so immediately. Make this the very next movie you watch. Literally.	The music is so infectiously happy that it is basically impossible to keep your toes from tapping, your head from bobbing, and an ear-to-ear grin from appearing on your face.	The key to The Wizard of Oz is its pure, simple theme: Dorothy's desire to get back home, to safety, to comfort, to family and to love.	It scared the hell out of me when I used to watch it between my fingers when I was a kid, and (though it might say too much about my own emotional development) I still get the heebie-jeebies from a lot of it.	Judy Garland is perfectly cast as Dorothy. She is as clever a little actress as she is a singer and her special style of vocalizing is ideally adapted to the music of the picture.	An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant, The Wizard of Oz is a must-see film for young and old.
Julia is her usual relentlessly appealing and luminous self.	Even [Roberts'] detractors have to hand it her; this time out she's sublime.	A rousing, hugely entertaining movie.	Erin is far and away her own worst enemy  and a good thing too, because she needed at least one.	Erin Brockovich strikes out.	Taking full advantage of Julia Roberts's considerable talent and appeal, Erin Brockovich overcomes a few character and plot issues to deliver a smart, thoughtful, and funny legal drama.
Classic dystopian British science fiction that draws powerful and moving parallels to the state of the world.	If its backdrop and story never quite coalesce into a satisfying whole, then the film is saved by its sheer imaginative verve and by the terrific chase and battle sequences.	Darkly poetic throughout, the film starts with an explosion and ends drifting in fog with no clear resolution in sight. How brave and oddly satisfying.	Cuaron doesn't treat his future world like fictitious science fiction. He seems to be saying that our current paths will lead to an apocalypse not unlike this one.	One of the year's most invigorating and adept pieces of filmmaking.	Children of Men works on every level: as a violent chase thriller, a fantastical cautionary tale, and a sophisticated human drama about societies struggling to live. This taut and thought-provoking tale may not have the showy special effects normally found in movies of this genre, but you won't care one bit after the story kicks in, about a dystopic future where women can no longer conceive and hope lies within one woman who holds the key to humanity's survival. It will have you riveted.
This action saga is driven into unintentionally self-parodic territory only a seven-year-old boy could reasonably stomach.	The film should have been about Payne getting addicted to drugs, having a good heart, but doing really bad things to search for the man who murdered his family--not this mess.	It boasts a stylish surface, but there's nothing new beneath it.	A dumb film with a great conceptual hook from a director who visualizes better than he dramatizes.	Max Payne, game or movie, has precious little to say.	While it boasts some stylish action, Max Payne suffers severely from an illogical plot and overdirection.
Uma Thurman and Angelina Jolie move over, Gina Carano, a new riveting action star is born in Soderbergh's Haywire, a globe-trotting spy thriller, which is silly and movieish but delivers the basic goods.	Steven Soderbergh's action-filmmaking chops get a swift, vigorous 92-minute workout in Haywire.	Five minutes of Carano fighting, 85 minutes of half-baked espionage plotting that nobody, not writer Lem Dobbs or Soderbergh, seems to care much about.	If only the structure of the story was as robust as Carano, this thriller would have been hard to beat.	It remains to be seen whether Carano can do more than kick ass. But for now, she's a compelling candidate to join the pantheon of female action stars.	MMA star and first-time actress Gina Carano displays ample action-movie chops in Haywire, a fast-paced thriller with a top-notch cast and outstanding direction from Steven Soderbergh.
The questions are piquant, the answers droll and surprising.	Shot in a disarmingly improvised style, it's not clear whether this is a dramatic comedy or a very funny drama. Whatever it is, it boldly faces one of the biggest taboos of American society: male intimacy.	ultimately plays as behavioral experiment and, slapping their stomachs and chests in nervous rhythm, its leads are prime specimens	Shelton has been tagged as an extremely adept chronicler of the associations between men. It's fair to say that the director is good on relationships, period.	A surprisingly real male relationship examination.	Observant and insightful, this indie comedy takes a different tack on the "bromance" but still makes a point without sermonizing.
Quiet moments of power ensue, but so too do the gently manipulative clichés - the plaintive piano score, the moments of false tension, the one-dimensional bureaucratic bad guys - that plague much issue-driven British cinema.	Jim Loach's sombre, painful film packs a hard punch; harder than you'd expect from the soft-focus poster.	A powerful, deeply moving, understated account of a major social injustice that went unreported for many years...	How often have we seen well-intentioned movies become sanctimonious and lose their dramatic edge? No such accusations can be leveled at Jim Loach's Oranges and Sunshine, an impressive film that...	Oranges and Sunshine is an equally confronting and tender story about loss of identity of abuse of power, as told through the heroic actions of a secular saint who stood up to those who had no voice.	Grounded in a heartwrenching fact-based story, steered by Loach's sensitive direction, and led by a powerful performance from Watson, Oranges and Sunshine sidesteps its pacing problems and occasionally clichéd screenplay.
Your Action Fix. In lesser hands the video-verite could be annoying. But Ayer deftly incorporates it into the story.	A visceral and strangely gripping story of police brotherhood.	When "End of Watch" works, it compels with an immediacy few filmmakers can hope to achieve. It's worth stepping over the occasional indiscretions to get to the good stuff.	Writer/director David Ayer gives us an authentic, sometimes shockingly gruesome ride along.	The best scenes are filmed inside the cruiser, dashboard shots that face inward instead of out, catching Gyllenhaal and Peńa in moments so playful and true they make all other buddy cops look bogus by comparison.	End of Watch has the energy, devotion to characters, and charismatic performances to overcome the familiar pitfalls of its genre and handheld format.
Both XXX and its title character are devoid of personality, without even something like "shaken, not stirred" to potentially turn into a trademark.	The filmmakers might as well have given guns to those mountain-biking, sky-diving buddies from the Mountain Dew ads.	A PlayStation game come to life, XXX is a movie almost exclusively dependent on the special effects department and the charm of its leading man, Vin Diesel. But it's sound and fury signifying nothing.	The movie delivers -- occasionally.	XXX is a skin flick of a different sort. Regardless of how many X's there are in this movie's title, it doesn't manage to completely mark the spot.	It has an endearing lack of seriousness, and Vin Diesel has more than enough muscle for the starring role, but ultimately, XXX is a missed opportunity to breathe new life into the spy thriller genre.
Screenplay is tight, funny, smart and insightful, and [the] direction has just enough indie feel without becoming too self-conscious or preachy.	The film isn't as funny as it could be, largely because Simien's tone isn't as fueled by anger as [Spike] Lee's films, but when he scores, it's often a bullseye.	A film that's as honest about the complexities and contradictions of identity as we're likely to see in a movie theater this year.	The movie finds real power in its climax ...	One of the freshest, funniest, boldest debut films to come along in years.	Dear White People adds a welcome new voice to cinema's oft-neglected discussion of race, tackling its timely themes with intelligence, honesty, and gratifyingly sharp wit.
Something like a finely-written and -acted soap opera.	Garcia keeps his various stories flowing and in perfect balance.	Great dramatic acting by the three lead women, and it's fantastic to see Samuel L. Jackson back in a strong supporting role.	Poses a number of intriguing questions about the nature of maternity, only to obscure them with a gloss that is equal parts sentiment and subtle but specious politics.	An extraordinary film about adoption and the lives of three very different women on separate quests for love, nurturing, and personal fulfillment.	Though it occasionally veers into unnecessary melodrama, Mother and Child benefits from a stellar cast and writer-director Rodrigo Garcia's finely detailed, bravely unsentimental script.
A down-to-earth, almost crude film - a simple record of pain	A hushed contemplation of the kind of senseless, all-too-frequent tragedy that leaves the survivors reeling and speechless.	Stands as a gentle reminder that while loss is inevitable, it need not be ruinous.	An honest and compelling film that effectively explores grief and the search for resolution.	I certainly found its depiction of a family affected by grief far more believable and effective than the strident dish-breaking, breast-beating of In the Bedroom.	The Son's Room is a moving and contemplative study of grief.
A superficial escapist fantasy for fans of the show.	Quick to capitalize on one of its assets, now that the 65-episode cap of Lizzie McGuire has been fulfilled, Disney has turned around and popped out a pay-per-view version.	Nothing in The Lizzie McGuire Movie warrants the leap to the big screen.	Those familiar with the popular and titular Disney channel series will be satisfied.	Cheesy. Still, it could be worse. Fans of the TV show are charmed by Lizzie, and the movie is definitely all hers.	Harmless piece of fluff that ought to satisfy fans of the TV show.
Suas piadas sгo уbvias, seu roteiro й pouco inspirado e a direзгo de Barry Sonnenfeld й auto-indulgente e equivocada.	Plot assumes little importance here. It's those amazing creatures that count!	...the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning.	Most of the things that made the original Men in Black such a pleasure are still there.	The predictable effort makes the movie seem longer than its audience-friendly 88 minutes, and the script deficiencies account for the high number of alien and human supporting players.	Lacking the freshness of the first movie, MIB 2 recycles elements from its predecessor with mixed results.
Where most documentaries offer us facts to hold on to, [McElwee's] are obsessed with the mystery of things we don't know and never will.	The mysteries McElwee sets out to solve aren't very involving, and his meandering style, while charming first and literate, becomes repetitive and yes, even a little dull.	McElwee, he of the wonderful Sherman's March, noodles delightfully around the South again, only this time in his native North Carolina.	You end up wishing it would amass into something more than the sum of its elements.	An utterly mundane miracle, a sampling of gentle insight and poetic retrospection quietly at odds with the exploitative culture around it.	A rich, eccentric documentary about both filmmaking and the tobacco industry.
An ordinary and sordid movie.	All of the action takes place during a single day, and there's enough action in this one short period to fill the entire career of a normal cop.	As if the LAPD needed any more bad publicity.	At once droll and incredibly intimidating, Washington is a knockout.	Being bad brings out the best in Washington, and his performance elevates Training Day past its familiar street-cops scenario into something richer and far more engrossing.	The ending may be less than satisfying, but Denzel Washington reminds us why he's such a great actor in this taut and brutal police drama.
Young teens will like brash, immature humor.	Director Tamra Davis and screenwriters Sandler and Tim Herlihy scatter the bad jokes like fertilizer. Nothing sprouts.	It's refreshing to revisit the jester in his screen infancy, when all he wanted was to boogie to a Culture Club hit, carry on conversations with hair care products, and sit on a sprinkler.	This is Adam Sandler at his best, and his latest films are cheap grabs at what once came so easily to him.	Idiotic, amateurish - and really, really funny.	Billy Madison is typical early immature fare from Adam Sandler, even if it finds moments of inspired lunacy.
A sort of ballet of emotions, executed with weightless grace and poise.	Superbly played and realised, this stays with you.	Depicts everyday details and conveys overarching emotional upheavals with a compassion and gentleness that's quietly devastating.	Celebrated French filmmaker Claire Denis is a master of atmosphere and immersion.	Understated, beautifully acted, and with an exacting soundtrack, 35 Shots of Rum goes down easily but packs a subtle kick.	This slow-moving French family drama is rich, complex, subtle and emotionally eloquent.
If nothing else, proves that when you take Julia's lipstick away, much of her appeal goes, too.	Who would have thought that a movie directed by the talented Stephen Frears and featuring capable acting by John Malkovich and a decidedly un-perky and un-made-up Julia Roberts would fall off the tracks and fail?	Mary Reilly is haunting, not only because of its foggy, shadowy settings, but because of the questions it encourages us to ask about ourselves and others.	Those expecting a traditional horror film may be disappointed. However, for those with an open mind, and a taste for the eerie, Mary Reilly may well be one to watch.	'Boring' is just about the worst thing a movie can be and Mary Reilly is boring.	The movie looks good and has its moments. But, overall, the movie borders on boredom.
Black-and-white looks good; romance is colorless, that's bad.	Genial performances and a pleasing plot are elevated to the stuff of cinematic majesty by Thierry Arbogast's glorious monochrome photography, which recalls the Parisian vistas of the nouvelle vague.	Ultimately too slight a work on which to end a directorial career.	Good looking but tedious.	It's too bad it took so long for the film to get here, because it's not only the best part, it's also the very end.	The clunky dialogue and shallow characters fail to capitalize upon Angel-A's stunning, poetic cinematography.
Director Roland Emmerich has a knack for belaboring a point, explaining everything to us in dialogue and visuals often and repeatedly and over and over.	The movie is like an advertisement for more defense spending.	No matter how ludicrous and coincidental the plot gets, it never takes itself seriously.	So much about ID4 is so old it's inevitable that homesick audiences, eager for familiar scenarios, will embrace it as if it's nothing but new.	Switch your brain down and enjoy it. And take along a barf bag for those excruciating American patriotic scenes.	The plot is thin and so is character development, but as a thrilling, spectacle-filled summer movie, Independence Day delivers.
Overlong and a bit overcooked...but it's also properly grueling.	riddled with slow pacing, melodrama and viewer fatigue	Well-cast and sporadically gripping.	It's a gripping great-escape yarn of the sort we don't see much anymore.	There are few moments when you're not totally absorbed by the film.	The Tunnel is both a tension-filled thriller and a riveting history lesson.
This documentary from writer Sebastian Junger will leave audiences with a new admiration for what fighting men must endure.	This movie will stir your heart and open your mind. It's a group portrait of practicing patriots.	Restrepo deserves some highlighting as one of the very few films from our current "war years" that resonates after the lights go up.	Directors Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger have come up with one of the most direct, searing documentaries in the history of US war in the Middle East.	This isn't the movies. It's life.	Forsaking narrative structure for pure visceral power, Restrepo plunges viewers into the experiences of soldiers on the front lines of the Afghan War.
As a tribute to those who died, and survived, on Sept. 11, World Trade Center is a scrupulous and honorable film.	A different, and more focal, jumping-off point for the sort of spiritualism Stone has tackled in past films. It's occasionally voyeuristic and ineloquent at its conclusion, but it's an honest story of human connection with great performances.	A tragedy in a vacuum, a story where two twinkles of hope blot out darkness, a tale of triumph that's hermetically sealed and packaged for maximum feel-good consumption.	The one proactive character in the movie is Dave Karnes...THAT'S the guy I want to see a movie about.	Truth is stranger than fiction -- even in Oliver Stone's hands. 'World Trade Center' is an honorable film.	As a visually stunning tribute to lives lost in tragedy, World Trade Center succeeds unequivocally, and it is more politically muted than many of Stone's other works.
Afterschool, the almost frighteningly accomplished first feature made by Antonio Campos when he was 24, is high school as horror show.	With a lingering and often awkward style, Afterschool is ambitious but ultimately lacklustre.	Afterschool presents modern youth in a cold light. It's difficult to like but even harder to dismiss.	This is a major debut. A dystopic vision, yes; but in comparison with the usual school high-jinks from US cinema - fiercely fresh and corrosively memorable.	This is certainly an original work, but not entirely successful in saying anything new about the way we watch "reality" today at second hand.	Antonio Campos'Afterschool is an intelligent, ambitious debut that boasts strong performances and plenty of ideas.
Why must so many family-friendly romantic comedies give us such wan, forgettable dialogue and predictable situations? Dan is derivative at best, and feels like filmmaking by focus group at worst.	For all its by-the-numbers plotting, Dan in Real Life is winningly good-natured and funny.	In the movie world, these characters might have been interesting, but in real life, they were too one-dimensional to make you want them to find true love.	A sweet, affectionate and emotionally genuine venture into that complicated crossroads of family tribal conflict and found love, however unavailable that sexy creature might be.	Carell has continued to grow and mature as an actor.	The fine performances elevate Dan in Real Life beyond its sentimental plot.
The Fifth Element has to be the most creative visualization since Tim Burton's first Batman in 1989. On top of that, it's a whole lot of fun.	Loud, long, and overwhelming...	The Fifth Element actually feels like it was scripted by a daydreaming teenager, but in a good way; that is to say, there's a certain "gosh, wow" sense of wonder to the whole thing that echoes the completely unique universes of George Lucas and company.	There's no doubt about it, when it comes to saving the world, Bruce Willis is your man. He does it with smarts and style, humor and courage.	His enthusiasm for this project is so pervasive that you can't help share his sense of enjoyment	Visually inventive and gleefully over the top, Luc Besson's The Fifth Element is a fantastic piece of pop sci-fi that never takes itself too seriously.
Hogan's adapation is likely faithful to a fault: it goes through the motions of the story without seeming to have any reason for telling it.	This Pan is sure to win over anybody who enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean, another rousing romp in which swordplay, cannon fire and peril were played for kicks.	Maxfield Parrish- influenced look, unhurried storytelling, heartfelt performances and graceful direction make for a film as comforting and warm as sitting around the fireplace.	Even though the film employs up-to-date special effects..., its spirit may be truer to Barrie's ideal than any other film version.	A tribute to the power of good storytelling.	Solid if far from definitive, this version of Peter Pan is visually impressive, psychologically complex and faithful to its original source.
blows more than the acctresses in the directors old movies	It fails to be even a little inventive, and it's not scary at all.	It isn't the least bit scary -- a considerable liability for a horror film -- but it's watchable in its own rancid, special little way.	Sickeningly violent nonsense.	Pure unadulterated garbage	See No Evil is packed with cliches from countless other teen slasher films, making for a predictable, scare-free waste of time.
"No" gives a fresh look at the little known history of a country whose duly elected government under Salvador Allende was overthrown in a military coup led by Pinochet in 1973.	It hangs on three ideas...While each...is intriguing, the execution of all is less than satisfying.	Evocative and suspenseful, the film is a fascinating glimpse into recent history and the democratic process.	It's a perfectly fine movie, but given its fairly radical storyline, the filmmaking tends to hew toward the safe and the familiar.	Last of a trilogy of films about Chilean politics, told through the story of an ad man using positive images to persuade voters to reject a dictator.	No uses its history-driven storyline to offer a bit of smart, darkly funny perspective on modern democracy and human nature.
This is movie's tell, revealing that for all its cultivated effort by a brilliant cast and director, it's still dependent on antiquated screen gimmicks.	Rounders has its strengths, to be sure, but for all its polish it never manages to strike the heart.	What performances!	Damon's portrayal adds a complex level of moral conflict.	It's too bad with all of the poker action there wasn't enough time to establish the relationships between characters.	Richly atmospheric and colorful performances contributed to the movie's entertainment value.
High-spirited, sweetly satisfying, it's an inspirational, feel-good family film that's reminiscent of - but not as good as - "Seabiscuit."	Mildly pleasant, but never once does it surprise us.	It's to Fanning's and Russell's credit, and the filmmakers', that the formula never gets the better of the film.	Any girl (and a lot of boys) in the target age group are going to make Dreamer one of their favorite films.	Lovely family film, which has a way of resonating in one's imagination for days.	Though formulaic, this horse story's saving grace is its strong performances.
...after two and a half hours with these ladies, I've decided that I like them.	You wouldn't spend valuable real-life time hanging out with self-absorbed idiots like this, so why on Earth would you watch a TV show (or a movie) about them?	Even fans may find themselves wondering when this very long episode will end.	There are flashes of graphic nudity and the usual salty language. But we fans wouldn't have it any other way.	The ladies settle into the doldrums of marriage and their antics are reduced to a detached series of scenes that involve sulking, yearning or just plain indulging.	Sex and the City loses steam in the transition to the big screen, but will still thrill fans of the show.
While it's not as good as the first film, Day Watch is a nice alternative to the American horror flicks that have been polluting the cinemas this year.	Day Watch is fast and furious and larded with bizarre laughs, and given its ending, we really can't wait to see what happens in Dusk Watch, the third installment.	There's something to be said when the big reveal of a hiding place for a piece of chalk is more emotionally satisfying than the dramatization of a young boy turning towards evil.	all at once a complex morality tale, a dark mirror of post-Soviet Russia, and a masterpiece of dynamic surrealism, displaying some of the most imaginative visual effects yet seen in a feature-length movie.	This sequel to the convoluted Night Watch offers more of the same.	Day Watch is frequently cheesy but it offers enough twists, surprises, and inventive action sequences to maintain viewer interest.
Read this review, skip this movie, and instead read the excellent books. Poor Dakota Blue Fanning is the perfect Lyra in a terrible adaptation.	I realize that when you make a book into a movie you cannot include every single detail, but it seems like Weitz purposely tried to take all of the magic out of the story.	This plot may sound somewhat ludicrous on paper, but Pullman has created a logical, well-thought-out world that Weitz has brilliantly translated to the big screen.	Like every other story that pits the Haves against the Have-Nots.	Exciting and entertaining, although the complicated array of characters makes it sometimes hard-going.	Without the bite or the controversy of the source material, The Golden Compass is reduced to impressive visuals overcompensating for lax storytelling.
Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.	Great fun.	The film is uproarious without ever becoming nasty or mean-spirited.	De Niro delivers.	A non-stop riot headed up by the first rate pairing of Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.	Despite sometimes sitcom-like execution, Meet the Parents is a hilarious look at familial relationships that works mostly because the chemistry between its two leads is so effective.
if you've ever wondered why people in 12-step programs aren't supposed to sleep together right off the bat, well, this movie is about to show you, in detail.	... a harrowing character study.	Down to the Bone emerges with an aura of authenticity so strong as to be mesmerizing, thanks to a superior script brought to life with infallibly natural performances ...	The movie seems to be about drug addiction and recovery, but it gradually shifts, becoming a look from an unusual angle at what a big job it is to be a parent and the priorities it requires.	Conventional movies, even independent ones, tend to get histrionic and judgmental about such drug-related setbacks. But Granik's film, though hardly a clinical case study, keeps a measured distance from the heavy-handed or simplistic.	A vivid portrayal of the effects of drug abuse that avoids cinematic clichés, Down to the Bone is a winning effort that features Vera Farmiga's breakout performance.
Even though this dramatic thriller is set in a place most viewers will be unable to identify with, filmmaker Alain Guiraudie and his cast draw us in completely.	Guiraudie's film is acutely brilliant on the funny, scary machinery of desire, and how easily humans can get caught up in its cogwheels.	The existential loneliness...and the evanescent nature of deeper human interaction in a world where sexual compulsion takes top priority are evoked with a powerfully dry yet keen observation that is heartbreaking.	Alain Guiraudie's thriller is characterised both by its formal ingenuity and its surprisingly graphic gay sex. The plotting rekindles memories both of Patricia Highsmith novels and of Hitchcock films.	The film's circumscribed scope is simultaneously its most intriguing and most limiting factor.	Sexy, smart, and darkly humorous, Stranger by the Lake offers rewarding viewing for adult filmgoers in search of thought-provoking drama.
Monica Ali's best-selling debut novel about life in London's Bangladeshi quarter gets a sensitive treatment from director Sarah Gavron, deftly condensing its sprawling narrative without sacrificing colour or texture.	Quietly effective, acted with resource and directed with the kind of patient skill it needs.	Fewer incendiary incidents and a red pencil applied to the script might have freed the good movie that's buried somewhere beneath layers of unearned emotional conflict.	It's a testament to Kaushik's acting ability that he turns what could have been an odious character into a quite likeable one.	The daily grind of a Brick Lane Bangladeshi is credibly brought to life in this sensitive and intelligent adaptation of Monica Ali's novel.	Frustratingly slow-moving, but ultimately saved by Chatterjee's solid acting and Gavron's gentle patience.
Doesn't ever quite seem to elevate itself above an '80s 'youth against the establishment' genre film.	Funnier than it has any right to be and it's generally enjoyable.	What really drags this sloppy but functional movie down are the cringe-inducing moments of homophobia masquerading as political correctness.	Funnier than Woody Allen's last four movies, more exciting than Tarkovski's The Sacrifice, Out Cold will play best if your first legal beer is still far enough into the future to seem a vision of the promised land.	Really the only highlight here is the unscripted outtakes that run before the closing credits.	A party movie that substitutes surfs for snow, Out Cold will leave viewers just that with its gross-out humor and sophomoric plot.
Instead of exploring this dangerous mind, Clooney plays it safe, making his freshman film deadly dull as a result.	If it's true, how scary is that? If it's not true, it's a great idea for a story.	Too succinct and too straightforward for its enigmatic subject.	The film may be a pleasure to look at, but in the end it's so uninhabited it becomes a chore to watch.	An irresistible sham.	Rockwell is spot-on as Barris, and Clooney directs with entertaining style and flair.
Looking for a film in which the drama rests on fighting over whether the original Macintosh will say hello over the machine's speaker? Then this is for you.	Written, directed and acted to perfection, and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed. Fassbender rips through the role of the volcanic Jobs. Is he really that good? Hell, yeah.	As sharp and slick as Steve Jobs is, it ends up feeling more interested in entertainment than enlightenment.	Fassbender looks enough like Jobs that it's not distracting, and he finds a voice for the character.	To paraphrase the old company slogan. . . . Aaron Sorkin thinks different.	Like the tech giant co-founded by its subject, Steve Jobs gathers brilliant people to deliver a product whose elegance belies the intricate complexities at its core.
A rambling and incoherent vision of the near future, Southland Tales proves a major disappointment from the talented Richard Kelly.	Spending $12 and 2 1/2 hours (30 minutes less than the Cannes cut) on something as aggressively bad as Southland Tales is not something I can recommend with a clear conscience.	Writer/director Richard Kelly misses the mark with this bubbling stew of images and ideas that never quite congeals into a viable film.	By the climax, his truly ambitious, truly flawed film finally disappears into the 'time-space rift' (or whatever) to achieve some sort of cosmic transcendence.	There are so many ideas sliding into Kelly's swirling vortex of pop culture overload and apocalyptic forecasting that it's understandable not to find coherence in it.	Southland Tales, while offering an intriguing vision of the future, remains frustratingly incoherent and unpolished.
The sentimentality is mighty, and the use of the CinemaScope size does not make for any less awareness of the thickness of the goo.	[It made] more money than any other film from the 1950s except The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur.	One of Disney's simplest and most delightful animated features	in many ways it is closer to the man Walt Disney's view of the world than any of his preceding films, especially the way it is filtered largely through his sense of nostalgia for the Victorian era	Technically, Disney has created nothing finer.	A nostalgic charmer, Lady and the Tramp's token sweetness is mighty but the songs and richly colored animation are technically superb and make for a memorable experience.
My favorite of the "Madagascars."	A culture change is clearly taking place at DreamWorks Animation. Hallelujah.	Set at a frenzied pace meant to connote fun, it mostly feels like a frenetic spectacle.	While it may blunder down the odd comedy cul-de-sac, Madagascar 3 is often inspired and very, very funny.	Madagascar 3 works because it knows its strengths and hits them repeatedly by being loud, frantic and dazzling.	Dazzlingly colorful and frenetic, Madagascar 3 is silly enough for young kids, but boasts enough surprising smarts to engage parents along the way.
The film is a classic and the chance to see it on the big screen again (or for the first time) should not be missed	In the end, Jurassic Park succeeds because it's good entertainment.	A cautionary tale about scientists and schemers messing with Mother Nature, the film makes its point. But it takes at least 30 minutes to get going.	Overall I give the movie a *** rating and wish the dinosaurs would have eaten all of the people except for say a narrator in the first 5 minutes of the show.	The earthshaking footfalls of these lizard-kings are palpable and terrifying. Spielberg's crew of dinosaur-effects artists has conjured up a Mesozoic menagerie whose realism outdoes anything in cinema history.	Jurassic Park is a spectacle of special effects and life-like animatronics, with some of Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since Jaws.
[U]ndeniably juicy packaging for what is, at its core, a good but not great crime drama	Abu-Assad captures the everyday reality of life in the West Bank and the psychological cost of living constantly in a state of powerless anxiety and desperation.	The film works best as a straightforward melodrama set in an anything but straightforward world.	Beautifully shot, complicated, smart, and undeniably intense ... well-deserving of its place as the Palestinian nominee for this year's Best Foreign Language Film.	Despite a conventional narrative arc and lulls in the rhythm, the film is a powerfully directed look at hopes and relationships ravaged by the world's most intractable conflict.	Twisty and riveting, Omar is a well-directed crime drama with uncommon depth.
A fascinating look at how a true event can become a media event - and how courting the media can have good and bad results so mixed up that it's hard to know where the good influence stops and the corrupting influence starts.	"Batkid" is a feel-good film, in the sense that the people who made this wish come true seem to feel pretty good about themselves. They certainly have a right to be satisfied: What they pulled off is impressive.	Cynics can carp. Let them. But don't be one of them.	There's plenty of space for cynicism in this bitter, cold world, but Batkid Begins makes a fine case for an authentically rare mass moment of everyone acting like a decent person.	Sweet, heartwarming and uplifting....	Sweet and unabashedly sentimental, Batkid Begins is an uplifting look at a selfless act that brought a city together.
Even judged by the not excessively demanding standards of middle-aged renovation fantasies, A Good Year isn't much.	There's a lazy quality to the movie. It's as if the filmmakers imagined themselves as taking a vacation while they were shooting it.	Movies with predictable arcs rise or fall on their cinematic moments. Fortunately, there are several in A Good Year.	When I think of humor and lightness of touch, Scott is about the last director to leap to mind, and Crowe nearly the last actor.	The course A Good Year takes feels like it's on rails: there's only one possible destination and only one way to get there.	A Good Year is a fine example of a top-notch director and actor out of their elements, in a sappy romantic comedy lacking in charm and humor.
Tucker has an eye for arresting imagery, but not the maturity or finesse to illuminate it.	The filmmakers strove to shock a society addicted to "reality" TV by forging through and actually showing them something actually real.	The film's strength -- and its weakness -- is in its you-are-there view of guys who are e-mailing their loved ones back home one minute and breaking down the doors of Iraqi homes the next, on the hunt for the enemy.	A doc that doesn't quite live up to its premise but still manages to go beyond packaged news and into the often surreal days and nights of soldiers in a strange, modern war.	Gunner Palace succeeds as a series of snapshots of the post-war landscape ...	A shapeless documentary, but shows what's it like for the soldiers on the ground.
One of the most devastating anti-war films ever made, animated or otherwise.	A very moving, but depressing movie.	Isao Takahata's masterpiece is one of the most profound anti-war statements ever brought to cinema	Isao Takahata's powerful anti-war movie is all the more harrowing for the care we invest in its beautifully drawn children.	Quivers with every kind of wracking emotion: rage, sorrow, despair, fatigue, and in the end, a tiny measure of hope that perhaps there's something better than this in the next world.	An achingly sad anti-war film, Grave of the Fireflies is one of Studio Ghibli's most profoundly beautiful, haunting works.
Freshman Orientation barely rates a passing grade.	You enter expecting something really stupid, and you wind up with something really clever . . . hysterical . . . wise.	Freshman Orientation is not incompetently made. Nor is it badly acted. But there's not a fresh idea in it, and everyone on screen seems to be in a different comedy.	A campus comedy with a dirty mouth, an innocent heart and a surprisingly wise mind, Freshman Orientation uses identity politics as a road to romance and emotional maturity. The naked breasts are a bonus.	Blessedly shrewd where it counts and deserves notice. The lessons develop naturally and aren't jammed down the viewer's throat like the hypocritical sermonizing in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.	This over-the-top comedy suffers from an exhaustive screenplay, which tries too hard to be funny...and fails.
Um dos melhores trabalhos dos Coen (e isto ж um baita elogio), o filme conta um roteiro muito bem amarrado, atuaушes intensas e um visual fabuloso.	A stylized reworking of the generic gangster film.	Up there with the Coen brothers' finest work.	The story isn't the film's major draw anyway...it's the look.	[The Coen brothers'] most complicated and dense movie.	Though possibly more notable for its distinctive style than an airtight story, this Coen brothers take on the classic gangster flick features sharp dialogue, impressive cinematography, and a typically quirky cast of characters.
Dallaire's horrifying memoir casts the sudden, savage murder of 800,000 Rwandans as a foreseeable event that could have been easily prevented had any country in the international community cared to even try.	Romeo Dallaire seems to be the only human in the world with a conscience. That it's eating him alive makes Shake Hands required viewing, perhaps even at the UN.	This wonderful, devastating documentary is as much Dallaire's story as it is the story of a whole continent abandoned by a cynical world.	You can't imagine a worse situation, but at the same time it's hard to imagine that a better man could've been on the scene, even if he was rendered powerless in the face of evil.	The documentary tends to focus more on Dallaire's plight than that of the massacred Rwandans, but it remains a powerful testament.	A gut-wrenching documentary about the man in charge of the UN peace keeping force during the 1994 Rwanda genocide of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus.
More novelty than spectacle, but overall a chilling exercise in nihilistic terror.	Inventive classic.	Perhaps only a director of Hitchcock's caliber can make such a fowl story fly.	Maybe not quite the pinnacle of Hitchcock's career but definitely in the top five.	Underestimated at the time, this is Hitchcok's last undisputed masterpiece, and a more complex film than Psycho	Proving once again that build-up is the key to suspense, Alfred Hitchcock successfully turned birds into some of the most terrifying villains in horror history.
A wonder-inducing drama about a six-year-old Korean girl who takes on adult responsibilities when she and her little sister are abandoned by their mother.	Gentle and observational, this slice-of-life from Korea has only the thinnest frame of a plot as it follows two young girls on a dramatic journey. But it's so vague that audiences will find it hard to latch onto.	With Treeless Mountain, Kim establishes herself as a first-class filmmaker.	It's subtle, moving and, despite the grim subject, hopeful.	Treeless Mountain casts a sad, pellucid spell. It looks at life from three feet off the ground and meets the hardening gaze of its 6-year-old protagonist head on.	Intermittently wondrous and harsh, this sensitive drama about two abandoned sisters gives time and space to the intimate and beautiful moments of childhood.
Dará mucho de qué hablar, y les dejará un grato sabor de boca. Imposible no verla.	Inspiring, memorable cinema.	His life story is not exactly as it is shown here, but close enough, I gather, for us to marvel at the way the human spirit can try to heal itself.	I went from disliking the movie the first time to coming, grudgingly, to respect it as a very clever, albeit misleading, melodrama.	It is a passionately told story, in highly cinematic yet accessible language, about one life: what makes it extraordinary is the performance of Geoffrey Rush and the rest of the cast.	Featuring a strong performance from Geoffrey Rush, Shine succeeds in telling a compelling, inspirational story without resorting to cheap sentimentality.
A good enough Western to cause many to kick up their spurs in celebration.	This is a story, you will agree, that has been told before. What distinguishes Kasdan's telling of it is the style and energy he brings to the project.	By the time the credits roll, we’ve had a whirlwind tour of virtually everything you can do in a Western.	It's like a colossal buffet: You take what you want and leave the rest, readily forgiving the worst of it because the best just tastes so good.	A terrific western with a superb cast	Boasting rich detail and well-told story, Silverado is a rare example of an '80s Hollywood Western done right.
Though it is a bit slow-moving, this documentary feature is visually stunning.	What Chinese Canadian filmmaker Yung Chang achieves in his documentary Up the Yangtze is remarkable.	Yung gets to the broken heart of a dying culture by conveying the impact of the dam on two individuals affected by, and participating in, the government's vision for 'progress.'	This is a sad film to be sure, but highly accomplished and very effective.	Far too many disparate themes are never woven together to explain the underlying purpose of the film's journey.	Up the Yangtze is a visually stunning meditation about the changes confronting modern China.
Happy-Go-Lucky doesn't condemn the optimistic way Poppy approaches life. It's wondering why there aren't more people like her.	The key to enjoying the film, a minor effort by Leigh, is warming up to Poppy. Her bubbly personality may be too much for some. She's like a walking, talking smiley face.	Leigh's most visually beautiful picture since Topsy-Turvy, Happy-Go-Lucky is all about the clashing and connecting of such emotional biospheres.	Mike Leigh seems to have had a great time writing about this woman who uses her sunny attitude as armor against life and more surprisingly finds that it works for her.	The opening scenes of Mike Leigh's latest slice-of-life dramedy Happy-Go-Lucky introduce a protagonist who appears psychologically disordered at worst, and highly annoying at best.	Mike Leigh's latest partially-improvised film is a light-hearted comedy with moments that bite, and features a brilliant star turn by Sally Hawkins.
It'll leap up at you, lick you in the face, then curl up in your lap and stay there, soft and warm and content.	Adventurous animal tale will have kids riveted.	A sprightly little entertainment that should enthrall tots without straining the patience of their parents.	So damn incredible, it put me to sleep.	Entertaining sequel w/perhaps first of big star voiceovers.	Disney's remake of The Incredible Journey successfully replicates, and in some ways improves upon, the simple charms of the original, with its cross-country animal odyssey sure to delight kids.
It's rare that a first-time director demonstrates such a sure hand, but Moncrieff is the real deal.	Blue Car may not be in the category of a classic, but it's certainly not a total wreck (more like a fixer-upper that's serviceable).	Cuts both ways: the poetry and the acting were hot, the story and the cinematography were not so hot.	Thanks to Bruckner and Strathairn, who's queasy beyond the call of duty, this is one indie that resonates well beyond the end credits.	Even with its drawbacks, Blue Car remains an intimate, thoughtful drama, with a performance no one is likely to forget.	A cautionary tale that rings true.
Far more successful at the gambler's rush than Matt Damon's schoolboy lessons in Rounders, Croupier is worth taking a chance on.	For once here is a British film that is both tough and intelligent, and so well-researched that it will probably tell you more about how casinos work than had it been a documentary.	Not since 1971's Get Carter has British director Mike Hodges made a movie as deep, dark and compelling as this thriller.	Croupier also offers an intriguing look at the writing process and the allure of writing, which in part is the ability to pull strings.	Stylish but cold.	The writer slumming for human truths and real experience is a common enough story, but this cool-headed and slick thriller provides a gut-churningly compelling backdrop to a look at our darker sides.
Hope Davis deserves much of credit for making Mumford work.	Not to be mistaken for any movie that has a gun in it.	The great performance comes from Davis who - not surprisingly - takes an increasing amount of Mumford's attention.	This film is smart, but also entertaining -- made to go with popcorn, a cola and, well, Prozac.	An intellectually vacant and pointless excursion to a town that is almost frightening in its artificiality.	Memorable moments are few and far between.
Stylishly gritty.	Ablaze with a raft of vital portrayals and rich in meaning and implication.	Inarritu and his cast are able to make the audience care for these deeply flawed characters and share their often intertwined feelings of pleasure and pain.	The structure lacks purpose, the film struggles to justify its two-and-a-half-hour running time and the faint-hearted might find it a little gory.	The performances here are, again and again, natural and convincing, with many of the actors making their debuts.	The brutality of Amores Perros may be difficult to watch at times, but this intense, gritty film packs a hard wallop.
an unconventional western and a serious drama	The characters here are probed and thoroughly penetrated, not through psychoanalysis but through a crucible of human conflict, action, gesture and expressive facial tones.	The movie is a classic.	Transcends the medium to become a mandatory viewing experience for anyone that identifies themselves as a human being, period.	The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) is a classic tale of the elusive search for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains by a trio of ill-matched	Remade but never duplicated, this darkly humorous morality tale represents John Huston at his finest.
The premise of this story is pretty fascinating but it seems that it gets diluted, not enhanced by the sheer amount of sex. I would be fakin' it if I recommended this movie.	Shortbus is chipper, it's fresh, it emits a distinct musk of controversy. I'll take the longbus.	Not surprisingly, the graphic sex on display in Shortbus has eclipsed all other considerations, including the fact that it's a fairly interesting movie.	It's more than a porno movie with a plot. The reality of the heart manages to always temper the allure of the flesh. Ultimately, Mr. Mitchell shows us that sex doesn't mean a whole lot without a deeper connection.	The reality of the film is that it's just an obvious and tedious melodrama about lovers negotiating the minefields of emotion and sex, and not quite connecting.	The sex may be explicit, but Mitchell integrates it into the characters' lives and serves the whole story up with a generous dose of sweetness and wit.
Though the story is standard formula kids' fare, the Allen presence brings an adult swing to it, making it more than passable for both.	Charming, Fun!	A dazzling delight!	...beautiful and visually appealing, but uninspired in the script department.	It's a well-written, witty tale, expertly executed!	Featuring a stellar voice cast, technically dazzling animation, and loads of good humor, Antz should delight both children and adults.
A modestly chilling, drawn out affair in which the characters and possible "scientific explanations" are more interesting than its predictable final destination.	A clever, small film that depicts showman-preachers and horror movies with a wink and nod, The Last Exorcism spends most of its 88 minutes staying a cut above the average horror flick.	Demons and rednecks form a terrifying tag-team in this creepy 'Exorcist'/'Blair Witch Project' mash-up.	The characters are better than in any of the other pseudo-documentary films.	Doesn't need any viral campaign. It's a good movie.	It doesn't fully deliver on the chilly promise of its Blair Witch-style premise, but The Last Exorcism offers a surprising number of clever thrills.
Thoughtful and a step above the typical romantic drama.	A movie with all the hyperventilating hysteria of a 1960s teen-tragedy pop song and all the disposability, too.	The New Yorkers who inhabit this overwrought melodrama with a mega twist are so self-centered that the message -- life should be savored, not squandered -- gets lost.	I laughed the hollow laugh of a cynical old movie critic during the eye-rolling final scene, which is certainly not meant to be funny.	Anyone longing to watch Pattinson do his best James Dean will see it in this deliberately paced story set in the summer of 2001.	Its leads are likeable, but Remember Me suffers from an overly maudlin script and a borderline offensive final twist.
[It] gets by on typical Tarantino gumption.	Lively and literate, Inglourious Basterds feels fresher than any Tarantino film in a while. Even so, smart as his writing is, it wouldn't kill him to see a blue pencil now and again.	Don't be put off by all the explicit gore, for it is ultimately vindicated by the flick's disturbing, self-referential way of delivering a thought-provoking message not only about war, but about our insatiable lust for movies about war.	Tarantino is much less interested in the gory possibilities of the premise than he is in old-fashioned suspense and tension	It's a meditation on movies, but also an exploration of the art of seduction.	A classic Tarantino genre-blending thrill ride, Inglourious Basterds is violent, unrestrained, and thoroughly entertaining,
A transcendent political poem as intellectually rigorous as it is beautiful.	It manages to ravish the heart while dazzling the eye simultaneously, neither at the expense of the other. It's a work of art that seems realized in an entirely organic way.	Seldom has a film about a subject as grim as this been so generous in its sympathy not just for the victims of a brutal system, but also the oppressors, often confused befuddled souls, who know not what they do.	Visually surprising to all the surroundings..forcing us to see it from a new perspective and ignoring the routine and what is familiar.	A lovely if sad story of contrasts one will not soon forget.	Gracefully assembled and ultimately disquieting, Timbuktu is a timely film with a powerful message.
The dialogue is so contrived, the characters so self-consciously quirky that Me and You often feels like a parody of an indie movie.	It's a sturdy piece of writing wed to an utterly unique visual style.	The sparks of brilliance littered throughout Miranda July's debut feature are just thatsparks.	Performance artist Miranda July hits a grand slam as the writer, director and star of her first film.	July is a delightful discovery, as both a filmmaker and a performer.	Miranda July's debut feature is a charmingly offbeat and observant film about people looking for love.
After a 12-year hiatus, Sean Connery is back in action as James Bond. The new entry marks something of a retreat from the far-fetched technology of many of the later Bonds in favor of intrigue and romance.	Can we just consider 1983 a lost year for James Bond? First, "Octopussy," then Sean Connery's return in a depressing dilution of the 007 brand - one that ends with a fourth wall-breaking wink indicative less of arch fun, more of bored indifference.	...one of the most sophisticated of the Bonds.	Without absolute conviction, no action film can survive: if there's no belief, there's no danger.	Connery has style, if not quite the energy quotient (he was 53 at the time) -- some nifty editing and a redundant dance routine make him look good.	While the rehashed story feels rather uninspired and unnecessary, the return of both Sean Connery and a more understated Bond make Never Say Never Again a watchable retread.
Wendy and Lucy's minimalist aesthetic relaxes rather than taxes our awareness, allowing it to linger over minute details, which, in turn, become monumental developments.	Wendy serves as both detailed portrait and metaphorical expanse. Her pain is specific but also vague, her loss exact and all-encompassing.	Turns the slimmest of narrative threads into a powerful meditation on the emotional cost of living.	It's easy to admire to Williams' performance, without ever feeling compelled to cry.	It doesn't sound like much, but Reichardt and co-writer Jonathan Raymond create a loose universe in which the characters actually seem to be moving through time, waiting, making decisions, cursing fate, eating, sleeping and waiting some more.	Michelle Williams gives a heartbreaking performance in Wendy and Lucy, a timely portrait of loneliness and struggle.
Charlotte Rampling, given the chance to portray an older, yet still sexual, woman runs with it	Rampling carries Under the Sand with her assured turn as the dolefully loyal Marie.	Charlotte Rampling's performance, alone, is worth the price of admission...	An absorbing, visually poetic portrait of one woman's subconscious refusal to come to grips with loss and grief.	Under The Sand lifts the phantom-spouse syndrome to the level of art, yet another dimension for this popular form.	Rampling carries the film with her finely nuanced performance of a woman coping with her husband's death.
Bad Teacher is more like a rebellious teen acting out against her parents than a truly rotten to the core degenerate kid. I guess you could say it's Kim Kardashian instead of being Lindsay Lohan.	It's a great idea, however the execution's not very impressive.	The story is predictably thin and the jokes suitably unsophisticated, but the clever characterisations help this paint-by-numbers comedy limp over the line to "watchable".	The concept titillates - an oversexed, drug-abusing, foul-mouthed, doesn't-give-a-s--- woman put in charge of a classroom - but the result is drab, obvious, and disappointing.	This is too easy, but I'm going to do it anyway: Bad Teacher? Bad movie.	In spite of a promising concept and a charmingly brazen performance from Cameron Diaz, Bad Teacher is never as funny as it should be.
A dull, depressing exercise in amateurism from a filmmaker in serious decline.	This is easily the worst movie set on Mars -- or anywhere in a Milky Way.	When there's no hacking going on, pretty much nothing happens except waiting for hacking to commence.	Though Ghosts of Mars is watchable and even exciting, it's not one of [Carpenter's] best.	A hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences.	John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars is not one of Carpenter's better movies, filled as it is with bad dialogue, bad acting, confusing flashbacks, and scenes that are more campy than scary.
Far more silly than sublime, but it has its moments.	Not unbearably terrible, just thoroughly mediocre.	Been there done that.	Exceedingly juvenile and strained of any colorful imagination not to mention hopelessly lame, RV is a colossally clunky vehicle in every sense of the word.	How fallen is the mighty Robin Williams, to plummet from the quality of "One Hour Photo" to "RV," a nearly unbearable movie.	An unoriginal and only occasionally funny family road-trip movie, RV is a mediocre effort that not even the charisma of Robin Williams can save.
Roman Polanski. Sadomasochism. What could possibly go wrong?	Roman Polanski's been making films about psycho-sexual mind games for decades, and when his opening shot poses his stage director next to a very phallic cactus, you know he's at it again.	What plays out is roller-coaster ride of shifting identity and sexual brinkmanship...Mischievous and sadistic by turns, it becomes a deadly serious battle of the sexes.	Roman Polanski is in playfully perverse form with this nimble pas de deux adapted from David Ives' stage hit.	S&M dance or feminist tract? Late career breather ... or Polanski answering his harshest critics? A cagey two-hander with tour-de-force turn by the sexy Seigner.	Provocative, funny, and brilliantly acted, Venus in Fur finds Roman Polanski in top late-period form.
It's a film that only begins to take baby steps in telling what went wrong and how insane it is to stick with such a bad war policy.	If any movie can rid Americans of 'Iraq war fatigue,' it's Charles Ferguson's muscular documentary No End in Sight. It provokes potent new feelings of outrage and catalyzes fresh thoughts about the right way to run a government, especially ours.	a horror show guaranteed to make you mad	A persuasive argument that the inception of, and response to, the Iraq War perverted America's ideals and intellect. Its moderate temperament hides obvious roars: Remembering outrage is all that will keep this from again occurring unopposed.	No End in Sight will leave you floored, agape and enraged anew.	Charles Ferguson's documentary provides a good summary of the decisions that led to the mess in post-war Iraq, and offers politically interested audiences something they'd been looking for: a lowdown on the decision making.
It's surprising this thing ever got released.	This wonderfully talented filmmaker will get to the serious stuff later in what is sure to be his long career. Right now, he seems far more interested in crafting a good-time scare, which he achieves superbly.	Overall, the movie's low-rent British specificity is a plus because the unique milieu provides a unique set of problems for the earthlings to overcome.	This pitch perfect blend of sci-fi action, comedy and social commentary winds up a gleeful delight.	A solidly executed example of the genres and conventions it intelligently satirizes.	Effortlessly mixing scares, laughs, and social commentary, Attack the Block is a thrilling, brisky-paced sci-fi yarn with a distinctly British flavor.
It boldly asks what you'd be willing to sacrifice to gain that freedom. And what more could you ask from a Fourth of July movie?	Having fought the British centuries before in Braveheart, Gibson brings the same intensity to The Patriot.	The Patriot comes across strong with some excellent supporting performances, oftentimes breathtaking cinematography and a plot that, like it or not, does tap many emotions.	A good film.	I would like to say to Devlin and Emmerich that they have hereby been forgiven for Godzilla.	The Patriot can be entertaining to watch, but it relies too much on formula and melodrama.
The best part of Scary Movie 5 -- not counting the part when it's over -- comes near the beginning.	You know that friend of yours, the one who can't tell even the simplest joke? Watching him struggle for 85 minutes would still be funnier than this movie.	Put it this way, there's a spoof of "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" in which gorillas throw their feces at the wall to see if it sticks, and you can't help wondering if this is actual documentary footage of the script meetings.	Scary Movie 5 is a dumbed down and hollow version of the franchise formula - resulting in an idiotic (and unamusing) attempt at parody that is tedious not fun.	Scary Movie 5 must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.	Juvenile even by Scary Movie standards, this fifth installment offers stale pop culture gags that generate few laughs.
A timely game of cat and mouse that benefits from the performances by its two leads.	A certain rawness and despairing urgency is never quite achieved for the message the film wants to deliver, and so it remains a well-intentioned, well-produced, yet generally unmemorable entertainment.	Crowe's a delight as a crafty Deputy Dawg from Arkansas; Mark Strong's Hani has an IQ to match his GQ. Surprisingly, the only undernourished part belongs to DiCaprio.	An unfocused, almost pointless spy thriller.	Russell Crowe's portrayal of an overweight, amoral CIA honcho in the Middle East thriller Body of Lies is mesmerizing, chilling, disturbing to the bone and one of the best performances of the year.	Body of Lies relies on the performances of Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio to elevate it beyond the conventional espionage thriller.
It's a lame duck of a film.	One of those rare movies that is so fantastically, fabulously bad, so bursting full of putrid dialogue and appalling scenes, that it becomes worth seeing as some sort of artifact of horribleness.	It's hard to find a more stalwart movie monster in the last ten years than Keaton, who's gone from a charming neurotic to a cobwebbed, cell-phone-wielding vagina dentata.	There's a special circle of hell reserved for whoever thought up the moment where Macht tells Moore she smells like "cake batter".	If these are the only kinds of roles we can conceive for actresses who have grown into their faces, as Keaton has, it's no wonder so many younger performers are seeking the knife.	Overly reliant on caricatures and lacking any human insight, Because I Said So is an unfunny, cliche-ridden mess.
It's a tragedy, in all of the wrong ways.	Lee doesn't trust his storytelling or the audience.	This is a slog of a melodrama. And with at least four sob stories competing for space, characters are left dangling like untied shoelaces, as backstories remain unfertilised.	It lacks dramatic impact and fails to deliver the required emotional punch.	A movie tomb in which zombiedom is confused with - what's the phrase? - "nuanced performances". Fireflies may be a douche to freshen up the thesp skills of A-listers, but why do we have to suffer for their art?	Despite boasting a stellar cast, Fireflies in the Garden is just tedious, dull and predictable melodrama. Instantly forgettable.
Director/co-writer Fredi M. Murer provides some whimsically absurd twists in this gentle observation of the travails of growing up.	Newcomer Teo Gheorghiu does a fantastic job of bringing the title character to life...	considers the adult world, and the genius coming of age in it, with delicacy, compassion, and the subtle humor of the human comedy at large.	Anyone who's been or borne a gifted child will smile with recognition at Vitus, which always keeps us guessing but connected to the young superman of the title.	The film pushes an off-putting message about unchecked privilege that reeks of capitalist pigdom.	Though not highly original, Vitus is slightly redeemed by its charm and compelling performances.
a gut-wrenching account of that day and all days where humans bring tragedy upon their own race	...once the true impact of the day unfolds, the power of this movie is undeniable.	A potent drama that refuses to sentimentalize or romanticize the Troubles.	Stunning.	The film ranks right up there with The Battle of Algiers and Culloden in the convincing pseudodocumentary department.	Bloody Sunday powerfully recreates the events of that day with startling immediacy.
Unimpressive, often bothersome, action photography and a surface soapy story line.	Timid about pushing the action pic envelope and an uncertain of tone, Biker Boyz never really busts out of second gear.	Basically a slow, lazy soap opera that just happens to be set in the world of California bike gangs...the intimate scenes plod mercilessly, shapeless and distended.	Watchable cheese.	Essentially, Biker Boyz is a soap opera wrapped up in the trashy-but-flashy packaging of The Fast and the Furious.	Waste of a good cast. For a movie about bike racing, it never gets up to speed.
You're usually too busy reacting to the plot jackknifes and trying to get a handle on the characters to connect on an emotional level.	It's really just a lot of whacked-out psychological mumbo-jumbo.	In an era when filmmakers invariably play it safe, there's something quite wonderful about a big star throwing all caution to the winds and, yes, reaching for the sky.	The film is seamless, surprising and erotic, mixing the best elements of romance, sci fi and drama.	An overlong, overblown misfire that expends a capable cast, an occasionally brilliant director and some first-tier filmmaking techniques on schizophrenic, ill-considered folderol.	An ambitious mix of genres, Vanilla Sky collapses into an incoherent jumble. Cruise's performance lacks depth, and it's hard to feel sympathy for his narcissistic character.
A very funny and breezy comedy.	Viewed even today with all of its plot elements recycled ad nauseam by Hollywood (for rom-coms, road trip comedies, odd couple/buddy films, etc.), the film still holds up because we believe Gable and Colbert and can identify with them both right away.	This charming romantic comedy, while grounded in the context of the Depression, offered light fare that's uncharacteristic of Capra. It might have been the first true sleeper since no one involved anticipated such critical and commercial success.	... stands as a significant landmark in cinema history, giving birth for more romantic comedies to come	As buoyant and elegant as bubbles in a glass of champagne, Frank Capra's sublime 1934 comedy... survives triumphantly because of its wit, charm, romantic idealism and its shrewd sketch of married life.	Capturing its stars and director at their finest, It Happened One Night remains unsurpassed by the countless romantic comedies it has inspired.
Nothing here will surprise you -- which is, really, as it should be. Segel, serving as co-writer, and director James Bobin have, with a knowing wink, mined the old-time Muppet charm and humor, and they have hit paydirt.	The writing is clever, with giddy self-reference, time-honored tropes, and a bevy of dancing chickens who beat out a completely credible tattoo	The new muppet movie, written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, is a total delight. Any fears that the muppets may have been unwisely thrust into something that is outside of their inherent character can be safely allayed.	If, like me, you are a parent, there will be something life affirming about taking your children to see these ageless old friends.	The chorus of one of the songs declares, 'I've got everything that I need, right in front of me.' For 120 minutes, that's precisely how I felt.	Clever, charming, and heartfelt, The Muppets is a welcome big screen return for Jim Henson's lovable creations that will both win new fans and delight longtime devotees.
Horrible Bosses takes a dark premise -- three buddies band together to off their bosses -- and rings it for a solid, steady stream of laughs.	Director Seth Gordon and his trio of screenwriters needed to give this script another wash or two. But once the movie hits its stride, it's a decent enough laugh-fest to garner a marginal letter of recommendation.	If this year's hit "Bridesmaids" is the woman's answer to the male-driven, R-rated comedy, then "Horrible Bosses" is a strong rebuttal.	A star-studded black comedy for anyone who's ever fantasised about killing their boss.	The would-be assassins' hopelessly bungling efforts produce a steady supply of laughs, though the jokes are rude and crude and the meandering plot doesn't make the most of the film's set-up. Fortunately, the actors rise above the script.	It's nasty, uneven, and far from original, but thanks to a smartly assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise, Horrible Bosses works.
Awesome for its time, but a little awkward today, this straight-talking shocker deserves regard rather than reverence.	Outre as it is, never tires as hypnotic, touching, ghastly fun.	A compelling and clinically brilliant combination of French art film and shock horror.	Both a horror movie and a dreamy art film without peer.	It's a fine B movie, but not worth the $30 list price.	A horrific tale of guilt and obsession, Eyes Without a Face is just as chilling and poetic today as it was in 1959.
Gere makes Robert's amorality appealing, which in itself conveys Jarecki's message about the seductive nature of Wall Street corruption.	For this story to work, writer/director Nicholas Jarecki had to include enough back doors to fill the scare floor at Monsters Inc. for a week.	For all the satisfying ironies that are dished up... some of what we're served is hopelessly naive.	Tim Roth turns in a momentous performance as a detective in a movie showing that billionaires do not always have it made.	Features an exceedingly dapper Richard Gere in a series of nice suits and handsome close-ups that serve no purpose other than to remind us how exceedingly dapper Richard Gere looks in nice suits and handsome close-ups.	Arbitrage is both a tense thriller and a penetrating character study, elevated by the strength of a typically assured performance from Richard Gere.
The gore is epic and the self-destruction all the funnier when it appears inevitable.	T&D offers good-natured, confidently executed splatstick whose frequent hilarity suffers only from peaking too early.	A droll sendup of the killer-in-the-swamp genre that gets funnier as it rolls along.	A terrific, no-budget picture teeming with guffaws, but it could've gone a lot further. I sincerely hope there are more Tucker and Dale adventures to come. Horror needs their blissful Southern-fried bewilderment.	This is one of those rare genre comedies that near-perfectly balances its blend of grue, guffaws, and gag reflexes.	Like the best horror/comedies, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil mines its central crazy joke for some incredible scares, laughs, and -- believe it or not -- heart.
It isn't engaging enough to really work and the direction lacks the imagination that might have breathed some life into it.	Nathalie... offers compelling food for thought, with a little visual stimulation thrown in on the side.	Underwhelming ending and all, Nathalie... remains a powerful exploration of jealousy and desire.	Between the leonine Ardant, the streets of Paris, and the nearly hypnotic score by Michael Nyman, the sophisticated Nathalie oozes with elegance.	Viva la anti-feminism!	A seductive French import that portrays adult issues of jealousy and betrayal with strong lead performances and considerable French charm.
The performances are astonishing, perhaps enabled by the flawless script.	Although the movie never quite dispels the sense of being dated (it could have been made anytime in the past 40 years), it's a memorable, often moving timepiece.	Handsomely shot and astutely cast, My Brother Is an Only Child should achieve the same attention and success accorded to The Best of Youth, whose scriptwriters worked with Luchetti on this one.	Luchetti directs with a light touch that recalls the Italian comedies that were popular -- in the U.S. as well as Europe -- during the period it portrays.	You don't need a degree in political science to love this film...The film entertainingly demonstrates that the bonds of blood are stronger than those of ideology.	Luchetti takes advantage of the storyline's historical context without sacrificing his cast's fine performances or the script's light wit.
None of it is handled with any emotional believability or grace.	Director Boaz Yakin ... keeps shying from the darker material like a studio-trained racehorse, heading for the safer turf of slapstick and schmaltz.	A light, occasionally charming and reasonably well-crafted tale about a transforming female friendship.	You can feel the screenwriters run out of ideas early on.	It's excruciating, a film of forced humor and fake, grating sentimentality, featuring two lead performances that elicit neither affection nor empathy.	With two obnoxious lead characters and an uneven screenplay, Uptown Girls fails to charm.
The production values are incredibly high and not just for the time. And as the movie has aged and the film has gone grainier and the flickers increased, it almost adds to the effect.	Messrs. Milestone, Abbott and Anderson in this film have contributed a memorable piece of work to the screen.	The performances are haunting.	Classic anti-war drama	Took an opportunity to question warfare and its civility long before the war protest film became popular in the 70s. It's dated, obviously, but still powerful.	Director Lewis Milestone's brilliant anti-war polemic, headlined by an unforgettable performance from Lew Ayres, lays bare the tragic foolishness at the heart of war.
This inspirational, rough and tumble, profanity-free testament to ingenuity also touches on the conflicts between work ethics and domestic responsibility.	While I don't like the way it simplifies history, I have to admit that Miracle is a hugely effective crowd-pleaser.	Miracle reveals in the dramatic story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team that giving oneself up to the Game is the highest calling in sports.	You don't have to know a blue line from a soup line to appreciate Miracle. You'll end up cheering anyway.	often feels like an endurance test, but there is no denying the uplifting nature of the event	Kurt Russell's performance guides this cliche-ridden tale into the realm of inspirational, nostalgic goodness.
Cast opposite Oscar-winner Jessica Lange, Paltrow makes abundantly clear her ability to compete with one of the best actresses in the business.	Disappointing thriller.	Hush will always find a place at sadists' film festivals.	Hush is the kind of movie where you walk in, watch the first 10 minutes, know exactly where it's going, and hope devoutly that you're wrong.	A mystery without surprises, a thriller without thrills. It's too bad, really, because the movie has a few strong points.	A ridiculous but wholly predictable potboiler with performances ranging from comatose to hysterical.
Although not breaking new ground in terms of the way it is shot and edited, this is a compelling story and features some excellent archive footage.	An extraordinary documentary about an American Idol-like TV show that manages to capture the volatile mix of history, religion, and pop culture in contemporary war-torn Afghanistan.	Havana Marking's uproarious, awareness-raising documentary tells us more about the title country than a month of newscasts.	Afghanistan's version of American Idol shines a spotlight on a culture in transition. Fascinating -- especially when it comes to the experiences of the woman who's risking her reputation and social standing in order to sing.	Afghan Star is as entertaining as any talent competition but also has a strong socio-political story, providing a revealing look at Afghanistan as its rebuilds after years of war, Taliban rule and struggles with democracy.	An enlightening and sobering documentary on Afghanistan's very own X-Factor.
It's a lovely, moving film, marked by memorable performances throughout.	An interesting examination of the unusual relationship between a bored college professor and an illegal immigrant. There are some thought-provoking discussions in the film patched periodically with rough spots.	A character study drowning in liberal guilt.	If McCarthy is the divinity of the universe he creates, its patron saint is Frank Capra ... The primordial truth about Capra's and McCarthy's characters is that if you scratch beneath the surface, just about everyone is decent.	The Visitor's allusions to our f----up state-of-affairs feel like gratuitous background noise.	The Visitor is a heartfelt, humanistic drama that deftly explores identity, immigration, and other major post-9/11 issues.
The film's effectiveness is bolstered by juxtaposed scenes of fat and happy Americans and Europeans slurping up frozen chai lattes and clucking about how big Starbuck's is getting with scenes of children going into 'therapeutic feeding centers'.	...gorgeously-shot, melancholy.	While the film is quick to posit fair trade as a solution, it fails to answer why, even with Meskela's admirable initiatives, his coffee farmers still struggle to buy shoes.	The film serves as a valuable explanation of the ways in which the cultivation and exportation of a particular crop can affect the welfare of fragile countries.	... a by turns poetic and hard-hitting critique of the global coffee industry ...	Black Gold is an eye-opening account of the winners and losers in the global coffee trade.
Chris Smith's low-key coming-of-age film/slice of contemporary Indian life takes forever to get where it's going, which turns out to be pretty much nowhere.	Hopefully Smith will make more movies in this laid-back, poetic style.	It's a subtle, truthful, moving story of class, ambition, friendship and romantic yearning, extremely well acted by a largely non-professional cast.	It doesn't sound like much, but in the hands of director Chris Smith, this setup makes for a good small-scale observational picture about young people finding that the world is a larger place than they imagined.	The resonant, beautifully naturalistic drama The Pool is a return to the familiar subject of haves and have-nots for director Chris Smith.	Beautifully crafted with loosely drawn characters and a lilting, natural pace, Chris Smith's The Pool features a universal message to which everyone can relate.
It breathes, it twirls, it prances right up into your face. It swirls over the top sometimes, but there never is any doubt you're watching a movie about something.	While it is horrible and sordid, it's also witty, fast-paced and intriguing as it explores freedom of expression.	It pokes at sexual taboos - it's pretty subversive, considering - but sexuality and creativity are indelibly linked, and its true subject is expression, repression and catharsis.	Philip Kaufman ... knows how to push the write buttons and leave all participants, well, satisfied.	You'll swear you can hear a throaty cackle of approval from the hereafter.	Though hard to watch, this film's disturbing exploration of freedom of expression is both seductive and thought-provoking.
this dismal little potboiler delivers only tedium	Dear Diary, I want to see a better movie than this one, signed an annoyed film critic woman.	Stay clear of this mess.	Not even Tyler Perry in a dress can save this embarrassing mess of a story	I'm not sure if it's surprising that the film is almost uniformly awful.	Tyler Perry's successful play can't make the move to the screen; this mix of slapstick, melodrama and spirituality lacks a consistent tone.
Gondry doesn't seriously push the visual envelope; all he's doing is assembling a souvenir, an almost great document of a party most of us missed.	A heady spirit of spontaneity permeates the proceedings, suggesting the entire pic, much like the concert it documents, was conceived, planned and completed in a single burst of creative enthusiasm.	A movie with good humor, good music and a positive message that isn't a complete embarrassment to watch.	While the future of Chappelle's Show remains in doubt, we have his insanely funny concert film, Dave Chappelle's Block Party, to sustain us.	Block Party is an uproarious good time, part documentary, part concert film, part who knows what?	Dave Chappelle's Block Party is a raucous return to the spotlight for the comic. Buoyed by Chappelle's witty, infectious humor and outstanding performances from some of the more socially conscious artists in hip-hop like Mos Def, Kayne West, the Roots, and (will wonders never cease?) the reunited Fugees, this documentary/concert film is a joyous experience. With an appealing mix like that, who doesn't want to attend this Party?
As unabashedly sentimental as The Song of Sparrows often becomes, this simple fable of a righteous man's relationship to his family, his community and most of all his faith has the force of conviction.	A touching tearjerker that's also a celebration of traditional values against the dehumanizing tendencies of modern urban life...with even the most obvious moments saved by an underlying sweetness and poignancy.	The Song of Sparrows is a sweet and uplifting humanistic fable that celebrates the joys of community and pastoral life over a harried and materialistic urban existence.	While the film incorporates a touch of neo-realism, Iranian director Majid Majidi isn't aiming for miserablism; his beautifully austere morality tale is more a sun-parched version of a different well-known story.	a greatly satisfying parable of happenstance	A heartfelt, affecting parable, The Song of Sparrows is another gem from Iranian director Majid Majidi.
8 1/2 is the best film ever made about filmmaking.	he effect is sometimes confusing -- but always beautiful -- and eventually intertwines to a singular life-confirming realisation that cuts through the madness and embraces it.	Marcello Mastroianni becomes an avatar for the great Italian director Federico Fellini in the surreal cinematic self-interrogation that takes place in 8 1/2.	This is a complex and painfully honest study of a man in a personal and professional crisis.	Fellini's manic, larger-than-life 8 1/2 rules as the king of all Italian movies.	Inventive, thought-provoking, and funny, 8 1/2 represents the arguable peak of Federico Fellini's many towering feats of cinema.
Country Strong is dead on arrival.	The downer plot with a predictable ending never rises above television tearjerker movie of the week, but the songs are enough to recommend to fans of this genre.	Why do I have to listen to Meester caterwaul throughout the movie and Tim McGraw (one of the biggest music stars on the planet) doesn't even pick up a guitar?	It takes a while for Country Strong to make up its mind what it wants to be about, and it takes even longer for it to figure out how to get there as the conclusion drags on and on, searching for a point.	A movie that isn't smart enough to realize how stupid it really is.	The cast gives it their all, and Paltrow handles her songs with aplomb, but Country Strong's cliched, disjointed screenplay hits too many bum notes.
Shockingly dark, the focus of "The Dilemma" is less about cheap laughs and more about the absurd humor of existential loneliness.	Pious, intense and often hectoringly implausible, the movie runs on empty while making loud "vroom-vroom" sounds.	The pejorative use of the word "gay" that got The Dilemma in hot water is still in the movie, and stands as one of its funnier lines. Not that there's anything right about that.	Even with veteran director Ron Howard behind the camera, proceedings too often veer off in the wrong direction.	The Dilemma is steadfast in its blockheaded moral code, one optimized for maximum pratfalls and foolishness.	It boasts a likable cast and an interesting premise, but The Dilemma can't decide what to do with them; the result is an uneven blend of cheesy slapstick and surprisingly dark comedy.
There is hardly a word that escapes from anyone's mouth that isn't plain moronic. There are loads of big boobs though, both figuratively and literally...good times.	You'd need a crane to suspend your disbelief.	Peter Strauss is taking a few moments from his busy schedule of gardening with Miracle Gro, which evidently is not miraculous enough to conjure the "w" in "grow."	Seems more like a combined auto show/Fourth of July celebration for firebugs than a movie.	A salt-lick for under-hung jackasses.	Even more absurd and implausible than the first XXX movie, State of the Union is less inspired and technically competent than its predecessor.
Working again with cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, who used sepia filters for an old photograph feel, Mr. del Toro creates an eerie, unnerving mood and maintains it to the end.	A ghost story with political allegories, it's a compelling tale about the effect of war on children.	Sure to give you a serious case of the creeps.	Del Toro risks ponderousness of pace and symbolism--of an oppressive artiness--to be true to his bleak vision, which is so compelling, unpredictable and unique that The Devil's Backbone really works.	Calling The Devil's Backbone a ghost story is an unfair simplification of an exquisitely crafted film... If you must label this film as horror, then it's a horror film with a soul.	Creepily atmospheric and haunting, The Devil's Backbone is both a potent ghost story and an intelligent political allegory.
full review in Greek	Jentsch is a mesmerizing presence in the role of this incredibly strong young woman, as is Mohr playing a man whose humanity and political beliefs are at odds.	The realization that we are, in many instances, listening in on actual proceedings gives the film an immediacy that no dramatist could hope to match.	German actress Julia Jentsch is phenomenal in the lead role, bringing a vulnerability to a character perhaps a bit too perfect on the page.	The film has a serious, urgent tone, but not a preachy or strident one.	A film that begs the audience to reflect upon their own courage and strength of character in light of this young heroine's daring story.
Take a bow, Mother Nature.	This first release from Disney's self-explanatory new arm, Disneynature, is at the very least peripherally concerned with the planet and its dwindling prospects, but the real renewable resource here is the groundbreaking Planet Earth miniseries.	Stars Mother Nature and the photography deserve standing applause.	A gorgeously photographed storybook.	This spectacularly shot doc gives our big, blue planet her due, with rare peeks at exotic creatures and thrilling action scenes.	With its spectacular and extensive footage, Earth is both informative and entertaining.
Except for a few crude exchanges,The Blind Side is almost as squeaky-clean as an old Disney movie. Unfortunately, it can also be just as cute and condescending.	Though not without its racist undertones, [the film] manages to take an inspiring story and use it to compose an entertaining and compelling tale...	Here is a movie that honours a downtrodden financial, racial and political minority: rich, white southern Republicans who carry guns and aren't afraid to threaten black people with them.	There are several ouch-worthy moments like this in The Blind Side, but they are spaced just far enough apart not to devalue the real worth of Michael Oher's story.	The Blind Side is less interesting for its milquetoast biopic character than for Sandra Bullock's inherently likable wealthy do-gooder.	It might strike some viewers as a little too pat, but The Blind Side has the benefit of strong source material and a strong performance from Sandra Bullock.
This amazingly well-done, admirably dry-eyed documentary about a true human victory over what was once a universal death sentence might well be the year's finest.	A heart-wrenching portrait of one of the saddest, most heroic chapters in American history.	An important, moving doc about how LGBT activism taught a community to shun silence.	It can feel inchoate, dropping the viewer in the middle of events without much context, and it exacts an emotional toll. But its raw quality also makes it compelling viewing.	Should be invaluable to every frustrated movement, as both a road map and a reminder of how vital personal activism remains.	Angry, powerful, and stirring, How to Survive a Plague is a brilliantly constructed documentary about the activists who pushed for action to combat the AIDS epidemic.
...Pray doesn't have a passion for the material. He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race.	Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers, old schoolers and current innovators, Scratch is great fun, full of the kind of energy it's documenting.	Exciting documentary.	Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give "Scratch" a second look.	The notion that hip-hop is much more than rapping is a persistent theme, and anyone seeking a solid introduction -- or re-introduction -- to that ever vibrant culture shouldn't miss it.	Whether you know anything about turntablism or not, Scratch makes for fun and informative viewing.
The remake has dumbed-down its source to a genre it always transcended: the slice-and-dice, snip-and-quip gore film.	While Haley makes for a decent Freddy, other members of the cast kill the party.	He's survived six sequels, a grudge match with Jason Voorhees and a terrible TV spin-off, but this remake may finally finish Freddy Krueger once and for all.	As the various teenagers fight to stay awake, you may find yourself doing exactly the same.	Fails to mimic or update with any competence.	Visually faithful but lacking the depth and subversive twists that made the original so memorable, the Nightmare on Elm Street remake lives up to its title in the worst possible way.
Stephen Chow's giddy genre grab bag of a movie is infectiously silly, breathtaking and easily the most exhilarating pure kung fu movie in years.	If you're not entertained, it's time to get off the decaf.	A chop-socky on f/x steroids that's devoid of genuine inspiration or involving character development.	Chow's best all-around achievement, meshing a coherent story, character arcs..., and technical depth.	The heir apparent to Jackie Chan, [Stephen] Chow creates a world where kung fu comedy fuses with a Roadrunner cartoon and The Matrix ...	Kung Fu Hustle blends special effects, martial arts, and the Looney Toons to hilarious effect.
...a watery historic stew crammed with too many events and not enough context or character development to fill out what could have been a compelling film.	A fragmented but fascinating glimpse of the famous German terrorist group and their violent legacy.	An initially riveting and provocative thriller filled with intense action sequences and strong performances, but the suspense and thrills wane as the convoluted plot becomes slightly dull and monotonous.	... an exhaustive account of how a gang of self-appointed urban guerrillas traumatized Germany during the decade following the global paroxysms of 1968.	Watching The Baader-Meinhof Complex is like a trip to a recent past that is too easily forgotten.	Intricately researched and impressively authentic slice of modern German History, with a terrific cast, assured direction, and a cracking script.
Aleelah And The Bee does a good job of engaging the emotions.	It had the potential... to be great had it avoided running lockstep with the structure of lesser films.	Producers, including Mark Cuban and Starbucks, should be commended for putting their money behind a film that, like Akeelah herself, dares to be different.	It won't happen but everyone should make a beeline to go see this movie	you'll still be cheering for Akeelah right up until the end of the film.	Although predictable in every way, a winning performance from its young star Keke Palmer and the rest of the cast makes it difficult not to cheer for the little heroine of Akeelah and the Bee. Sort of like Rocky for the middle school nerd set, Akeelah is a warm, family-friendly underdog story, featuring terrific supporting performances from Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett.
Written during their own creative block, Joel and Ethan Coen's noirish satirical allegory decodes the myth of the "sensitive" artist, the mysteries of the creative process, and the ambiguities of Hollywood authorship.	Genius. Every aspiring screenwriter has been Barton Fink, and if they haven't yet, they will.	Goes off the deep end.	Certainly not for everyone, but if you're looking for something different, something outrageously fascinating, something daring and open-ended, this is it.	Aside from Turturro and Goodman, this movie is chockful of good performances.	Twisty and unsettling, the Coen brothers' satirical tale of a 1940s playwright struggling with writer's block is packed with their trademark sense of humor and terrific performances from its cast.
Persuasively demonstrates Polanski was guilty as sin, yet his conviction was a miscarriage of justice.	Its indictment ultimately feels like a secondary issue to Polanski's apparently incontrovertible guilt, which makes him--in this instance--still more victimizer than victim.	An exhaustive and riveting narrative	Zenovich has made a feature worthy of its eccentric and reckless central figure at his most cynical and embittered.	In this documentary, the dwarf finally gets his due, fleshed out as a person rather than simply a media sensation.	A courtroom drama and an exploration of celebrity and responsibility.
The pat inspirational formula is followed to a sweaty T, although it comes here with an inadvertent side effect -- more than a few nagging questions never get answered.	If a late-middle-age tax professor can coach a girls' basketball team, there is hope for all of us.	Emotional, uplifting, vexing and infuriating, it's the first basketball documentary worthy of being compared to 1994's Hoop Dreams.	Serrill does a good job of grounding the film with the conventions to suck you in and make the team likeable. But then the politics and real stories emerge, which makes the film truly stand apart from the crowd.	Serrill's disciplined, beautifully constructed film is so propulsive, so spiritually triumphant, it's absolutely one of the best sports docs ever.	This group of high school girls and their eccentric basketball coach easily win your heart with their unusual humanity and dynamism.
Enthralling and moving.	One of the neat things about Before Sunset is that Delpy, like her character in these movies, dropped off the radar after Sunrise. Seeing her again is like seeing her through Hawke's eyes.	Well acted, very well written, well told, and bears yet another ending that will keep audiences wondering.	Although a sequel may not have been entirely necessary, Before Sunset does provide some closure...	Proves itself well worth the nine-year wait, and for a sequel so squarely rooted in the first film, it stands lightly on its own two feet.	Filled with engaging dialogue, Before Sunset is a witty, poignant romance, with natural chemistry between Hawke and Delpy.
You need a great character to make a bad thing good, and the action comedy MacGruber is sadly short on great characters.	Cut loose from the skit structure, screenwriters Forte, John Solomon and director Jorma Taccone seize upon a richer template, that of the ridiculous big-screen action-comedy refined by the Beverly Hills Cop movies.	MacGruber might be a wildly uneven ride, but it doesn't outstay its welcome and lined up against other Saturday Night Live productions it's hardly the worst of the bunch.	It achieves wit in a realm where stupidity is too often deemed sufficient.	Throwaway but genuinely funny throughout, MacGruber plays like Hot Shots: Part Trois or a live-action Team America: World Police -- a summer six-pack movie that makes up for in laughs what it lacks in longevity.	It too often mistakes shock value for real humor, but MacGruber is better than many SNL films -- and better than it probably should be.
This is Meyer's worst offense -- her disturbingly Victorian attitudes about sex and love, which this particular movie falls modestly in lockstep with, even though it concludes years of cinematic foreplay.	Breaking Dawn - Part 1 as a whole feels stretched-out, as if the filmmakers realized belatedly that there wasn't enough material in the book to sustain two movies. (There isn't).	Shamelessly cheesy, drawn-out and over-the-top as it is, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 is big, bombastic popcorn entertainment that knows exactly what the fans want, and delivers it in epic style.	If you insist on seeing the entire, seemingly never-ending 117 minutes, though, you're going to spend at least 87 of those minutes bored out of your mind.	For those of us who are not Twilight fanatics, or even fans, or could not care somewhat less than less, the arrival of Part 1 is not cause for trumpets blaring. But I would imagine that even those who line up for this film will be somewhat let down.	Slow, joyless, and loaded with unintentionally humorous moments, Breaking Dawn Part 1 may satisfy the Twilight faithful, but it's strictly for fans of the franchise.
Heart-pounding and fascinating ... fearless documentary filmmaking packed with horrifying moments.	It's an exemplary and incendiary instance of documentary filmmaking as real-world advocacy.	No Hollywood film, fiction or non-, can ever prepare you for the reality of what goes on in that cove. Please don't show this film to young children. Devastating and excellent.	Visceral enough to inspire action, no matter your politics.	It won't be a big hit in Japan, but this film is easily one of the best documentaries I've seen in awhile. Okay, it's one-sided, but who really wants to defend the slaughter of dolphins? I think this film will be a major contender in awards season.	Though decidedly one-sided, The Cove is an impeccably crafted, suspenseful expose of the covert slaughter of dolphins in Japan.
Van Der Beek's understated performance and Caan's hotdogging are refreshing enough to raise Varsity Blues above its clichés.	Formulaic, predictable, yet guiltily satisfying.	While there are some undeniable false notes, there's also quite a bit on screen that works.	...slick, well made, and well acted, but it takes no chances. Seems a wasted opportunity.	An unappetizing mix of raucously vulgar comedy and teen-angst melodrama.	This is a predictable football movie that lacks intensity.
Barnev gives a deftly Chaplinesque performance...but Díte never really finds any meaning or lessons in the choices he made, and neither will the audience.	A comedy-drama with a lot of slapstick, combined with a history lesson about an important chapter of World War II and beyond.	Tasty enough but inoffensive even when it should offend, provoke, startle.	The film remains a strange comic fable about finding happiness in the most outlandish of places.	Jiri Menzel's new film has more visual verve than any film currently in release, with or without computer effects	With charm and an eye for life's bittersweet moments, Czech New Wave master Jiri Menzel paints a picaresque story with whimsy and intellect.
I can only hope this episode turns out to be what it feels like: a very unfortunate, very rough bump in the road.	Plays exactly like a live-action video game. That's meant as a compliment, not a criticism.	Although the effects were fun, I kept asking myself: "Would I like this movie if it were in 2-D?" The answer was no.	Ready for more fun with kid spies Juni and Carmen Cortez? Hope so, because they're back, and this time in 3-D.	What's disappointing is that, unlike before, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez is more passionate about the film's machinery and less so about its motifs.	The movie will be found wanting if one is not taken in by the 3-D visuals.
Director Howard is so mesmerized by the flames, he squirts formulaic lighter fluid over everything.	Mocked by some, for reasons I can't fathom, I find it to be Howard's strongest film. Excellent cast.	The film exploits Chicago's terrain of ethnic neighborhoods, political turf, and glorious modern architecture, but it has trouble when it comes in close to the personal level.	Ron Howard's film is one of smoke-eaters, crispers, and torches... and it bestows a renewed respect on a profession all too often taken for granted.	Visually speaking, the film does pretty well with fire-as-spectacle, less well with everything else (Howard tends to trot out fuzzy-toned Spielbergian backlighting on any pretext).	It's not particularly deep, but Backdraft is a strong action movie with exceptional special effects.
It's twisty, provocative and impressively grim, a sort of Asian-extreme Manhunter for the strong of nerve.	South Korean first-timer Na Hong-jin offers nasty thrills, manic foot chases and some genuinely subversive riffs on the police procedural.	This playfulness, however, backfires massively in the second half when coincidence and unforeseen consequence conspire uneasily with bloody, messy results.	A grisly serial-killer thriller that develops into a howl of outrage at the ineptitude of the system.	In between moments of chisel-hacking horror there is some impressively dark humour and top-notch acting. But be warned - emotionally this movie will reach deep into the pit of your stomach and wriggle your guts about before wrenching them out.	A frantic and taut Korean serial killer thriller. One classy, if bloody and messy, gut wrencher of a movie.
Beautifully shot by Sam McCurdy ("The Descent,' "Doomsday"), "Centurion" is a throwback to the great Roman legionnaire and gladiator movies, but with prosthetics and "300"-style digital makeup effects.	Centurion isn't perfect but Marshall does bring a fresh spin to the sword-and-sandals genre giving it a modern sensibility; from rapid-fire action sequences to no-nonsense parlance.	Though seemingly content to be a B-movie director, Neil Marshall heads further into C-list territory with Centurion	Sack, pillage, repeat. Heads will roll. And bounce. And be stuck on pikes.	A fast-paced and action-heavy period piece that focuses on what matters most in a Saturday afternoon matinee: the good stuff.	It's a bloody geyser of Neil Marshall's typically stylish B-movie action, but Centurion is too focused on hacking and slashing to deliver original dialogue or interesting characters.
'Four Lions' truly is one of the best and most original comedies of the year.	Parts of the film are very funny and parts are misfires. But even on the misfires one almost feels one should laugh just to support the very idea of the film.	In Four Lions, five complete morons keystone kop their way toward terrorism and their 72 virgins...	"Four Lions" is a daring, brilliantly conceptualized film, but like the bumbling bombers of the title, the execution tends to be hit-and-miss.	An ambitious, uneven new farce that dares to mock the motives and personalities of four suicide bombers who plan to attack the London Marathon.	Its premise suggests brazenly tasteless humor, but Four Lions is actually a smart, pitch-black comedy that carries the unmistakable ring of truth.
you will walk out with a huge smile on your face and a spring in your step	A small movie that's been supersized.	Offers attractive, inoffensive characters and a smattering of broad laughs, but it fails to use its potential to explore weightier themes such as John's mid-life crisis.	The Clark character holds us because Gere makes us understand the frustration of a guy who simply needs a new spark to rejuvenate a good but stale life.	Where the original soared, the new version hugs the ground. It's like the difference between Fred Astaire's dancing and Richard Gere's.	The cast is warmly appealing, but with the loss of cultural context and addition of big-name celebrities, this American version loses the nuances of the original.
Sure it's ridiculous. Sure it's in generally poor taste. So what?	A gut-busting blast of tasteless tomfoolery.	Gauche, garish, and gross, a prime example of the coarsening of our culture and of the art of comedy in film. It's also pretty darn funny. [Blu-ray]	A fast-paced, hilarious comedy.	Irreverent and demented, but sweet	There's Something About Mary proves that unrelentingly, unabashedly peurile humor doesn't necessarily come at the expense of a film's heart.
From the opening scenes, it's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie.	It keeps your attention mildly engaged. But just that.	A slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly, wall-to-wall good time.	Slick, quick, rude and exuberantly crude.	I was expecting much worse from the film, but it actually was a nice change from stupid urban comedies like How High.	A sloppy, poorly directed action-comedy, All About the Benjamins is too derivative and gratuitously violent.
Deliciously sick and delightfully cast.	The plot is a threadbare thing indeed.	At times this can all become a little silly but Sonnenfeld manages to rein the film in before things get too ridiculous.	Basically plotless, this big-screen transfer of the cult TV series has some good vignettes and some good performances by Anjelica Huston, Christina Ricci and others.	The film's aimlessness and repetitiveness eventually become draining.	The movie is peppered with amusing sight gags and one-liners, but the disjointed script doesn't cohere into a successful whole.
The claustrophobic group becomes the perfect petri dish in which to create an environment of fear, paranoia, and betrayal.	If it's the most vividly guesome monster ever to stalk the screen that audiences crave, then The Thing is the thing. On all other levels, however, John Carpenter's remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi classic comes as a letdown.	I discovered what it was to love a movie that was relentless in its desire to be unpleasant	The strong cast brings the somewhat underwritten characters to vivid life, and the elaborate special effects (designed by then 22-year-old Rob Bottin) set a high standard for films that followed.	I'll say it: the single greatest horror movie ever made.	Grimmer and more terrifying than the 1950s take, John Carpenter's The Thing is a tense sci-fi thriller rife with compelling tension and some remarkable make-up effects.
[A] heartfelt, if rather repetitive, documentary.	A worthwhile record of an admirable undertaking, but a little less sentiment and a little more edge might have produced a stronger film.	You will never look at the familiar little fasteners the same way again. This is an incredible 87 minutes in a movie theater on several levels.	The events depicted in Paper Clips are by turns heartwarming, horrifying, amazing, and exactly the type of real-world improbability that the documentary form was created for.	It's nice, and occasionally affecting, but also fairly pedestrian.	A touching, though somewhat flat, documentary that follows a homogenous class of white Protestant eighth graders as they learn the importance of tolerance by erecting a monument to the 6 million victims of the Holocaust.
The first animation masterpiece of the decade. At first, French ennui meets Highland cheer; every frame teems with delightful detail. By story's end, the illusion of new romance proves more spellbinding than the romance of old-time illusion.	... A glorious revival of the neglected art of near silent comedy.	For its 80 minutes, the movie creates the illusion that not just Tati but his form of cerebral slapstick lives.	A remarkably uncomplicated story -- a beautifully uncomplicated story, really -- about the love between daddies and their little girls.	The story has enough sentimental schmaltz to grease a locomotive.	An engrossing love letter to fans of adult animation, The Illusionist offers a fine antidote to garish mainstream fare.
Brad Bird's richly imagined, retro-moderne homage to the superhero-fueled daydreams of his youth creates a vibrantly original mythology.	as stylish as Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but with more depth, and as giddy as Toy Story but with more of a soul	[An] unprecedented film that is not just a grand feature-length cartoon but a grand feature.	A laugh-out-loud funny, adrenaline-fueled romp.	Families will flock to and enjoy this movie, but it's likely only adults will really get it.	Bringing loads of wit and tons of fun to the animated superhero genre, The Incredibles easily lives up to its name.
Positioned awkwardly between serious historical drama and bloody action movie, The Eagle doesn't end up succeeding as either	[I]f it looks like a loving ode to fascism and sounds like a loving ode to fascism then, well, there's really only one conclusion to draw.	It's best approached like a buddy movie with gold standards. Because, by Jupiter, it's the rapport between Tatum and Bell that lifts The Eagle beyond any derring-do.	Its intelligence, as well as the light touch in drawing parallels with modern America's adventures abroad, is something to be admired.	Tatum and Bell are good in their roles but the movie just plods along even in its battle sequences	The Eagle has a pleasantly traditional action-adventure appeal, but it's drowned out by Kevin Macdonald's stolid direction and Channing Tatum's uninspired work in the central role.
Actor Fiennes, writers Camille Thomasson and Bart Gavigan and director Eric Till have done a laudable job of bringing this dusty historical character to life.	Relentlessly hagiographical in its depiction of Luther distorts Catholic theology and history, consistently skewing its portrayal to put Luther in the best possible light while making his opponents seem as unreasonable as possible.	A sincere, well-meaning movie, but it's stilted and ponderous, all too representative of the worst failings of simplistic docudrama.	A throwback to the days when such movies as 'A Man for All Seasons' tackled big religious ideas in the context of significant historical events...	Though LUTHER suffers from bio-pic-itis, it is more than just a pedestrian recitation of events.	This cinematic treatment of Martin Luther's life is more dull than inspiring.
Although it's a bit frustrating during its first viewing because it refuses to cooperate and fill an preconceived notion, Chunking Express ultimately rewards with subsequent viewings.	The pleasure to be had from hanging out with Wong's pale-and-interesting unrequited lovers lies in the zippy shooting style and warm, winning performances.	A near-perfect fusion of form and style, content and substance. One of the great movies of its decade.	Pure sensation, yes, but with a distinct point of view.	Tthis totally charming and uplifting movie confirms Wong Kar-wai's growing reputation as one of world cinema's most exciting stylists and should prove to be an excellent starting point for those unfamiliar with the director's work.	Even if all it had to offer were writer-director Wong Kar-wai's thrillingly distinctive visuals, Chungking Express would be well worth watching; happily, its thoughtfully drawn characters and naturalistic performances also pack a potent dramatic wallop.
Filmed with exceptional care and remarkable photographic ingenuity, no other nature documentary is as personal and as close-up as this one to the peculiarities of birds.	a filmic poem about the majesty that surrounds us every day	Winged Migration made me want to sprout wings and feathers, but only if I could migrate over short, safe routes.	The point of this true-life adventure is not the dissemination of information but the instilling of a sense of awe in the viewer ...	Iif you're in the mood for a film of staggering beauty that will open your eyes to one of the wonders of the natural world breathtakingly captured in all its glory, color, and movement, this is a must see.	A marvel to watch.
What's it about? I can hear you shout. Therein lies the rub: not much really.	Eraserhead is a work of rare genius and real bravery; it's a comic nightmare we all have at once and whose meanings lay just out of reach.	Nothing more than a pretentious, incoherent and boring exercise in self-indulgent weirdness.	Lynch's films exist independent of space and time, and only after twisting and turning through their labyrinthine visual corridors can we begin to piece together how they came to be in the first place.	This is a classic, no matter how comfortable it is to watch.	David Lynch's surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and a creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man's fear of parenthood.
[White Men Can't Jump is] like a game of pick-up basketball: it's intense, raggedy and explosive, now and then yielding moments of sheer gravity-defying grace, yet just as capable of producing air balls and pratfalls.	Even basketball-phobes will enjoy it.	Amusing and fun.	Rosie Perez steals the movie from the two male leads	Mostly, it rocks.	White Men Can't Jump provides a fresh take on the sports comedy genre, with a clever script and a charismatic trio of leads.
Powerful look at mental illness; ages 16+.	Fiendishly feline Jolie is stressed to impress, but her efforts are foiled by a script that keeps her tiger caged.	Sensitive, well-acted.	Ryder's is an earnest, well-meaning performance -- and she also coproduced the movie -- but the book's interesting tension and dark humor are pretty much absent.	Compared to most movies about mental illness, it's really a remarkably sane approach.	Angelina Jolie gives an intense performance, but overall Girl, Interrupted suffers from thin, predictable plotting that fails to capture the power of its source material.
Peter Sellers gives a stellar performance.	A placid, poignant, well-kept secret of a movie.	Sellers at his most restrained -- and he's superb	One of those movies that always seems fresh and relevant. In fact, this is one instance where the work seems more relevant to our own era than it did during its own time	It's perhaps the great comic actor's most emotionally moving role.	Smart, sophisticated, and refreshingly subtle, Being There soars behind sensitive direction from Hal Ashby and a stellar Peter Sellers performance.
Yes, this is a comedy, but it's also sad, and finally it's simply a story about trying to figure out what you love to do and then trying to figure out how to do it.	A magical slice-of-life whose small-scale nature is part of its effervescent charm.	It's a wonderfully simple story about feeling like a geek and realizing that you're not alone.	A humorous and touching tale about unexpected friendship.	The word 'lovely' comes to mind in assessing this intimate, character-driven piece about a man who tries to get away from people but finds to his luck that he cannot.	A sweet and quirky film about a dwarf, a refreshment stand operator, and a reclusive artist connecting with one another.
To say they've saved the best for last would be an understatement. It's a finale that's truly magical in every way, and easily the best Harry Potter movie yet.	This is such an entertaining, beguiling, charming and exciting picture. It reminded me of the thrill I felt on seeing the very first one, 10 years ago.	This is monumental cinema, awash with gorgeous tones, and carrying an ultimate message that will resonate with every viewer, young or old: there is darkness in all of us, but we can overcome it.	Sharply directed and appropriately tear-jerking, imbued with the gravitas of such an epic finale.	A fitting farewell for all the zillions of Harry Potter fans; not the best HP movie but one of the best.	Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying -- and suitably magical -- conclusion.
Technical wizardry apart, it's the supporting characters that make the difference, in this case the trio of plump guardians Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, and iconic villainess Maleficent the wicked fairy.	At once modernist and classical, Disney's Sleeping Beauty takes characters who look like paper cutouts from magazine cartoons and sets them against backdrops that look like expensive wallpaper patterns.	Is this the point when Disney animation lost its charm?	...a fine family film.	The picture is so misanthropic that its happy ending feels more coma-dream than fairy-tale resolution	This Disney dreamscape contains moments of grandeur, with its lush colors, magical air, one of the most menacing villains in the Disney canon.
This documentary therefore did exactly what a good music doco should do: brought people like me up to speed and, according to reports from more serious hip hop fans in the audience, provided lots of information that wasn't previously well known.	Despite accusations of nearly succumbing to spotlighting beefs over beats, the film comes off as an honest representation of a great group that's not to be forgotten.	Rappaport covers a huge spectrum of voices and opinions, and the themes he explores get into personal relationships -- something everyone can relate to.	If you want to know what hip-hop is all about, this 'rapumentary' is a fine place to start.	That mood of musical unity, of a sonic movement, is incredible, vibrantly recounted in Beats. It's more than just a documentary, it's a time capsule of hip hop originality and confidence.	This documentary focuses less on the music and more on the personality clashes and in-group tensions to great, compelling effect.
Trintignant gives a mesmerizing performance as someone wrestling with his inner demons.	More like a symphonic poem than a movie. Your breath is taken away by its baroque compositions.	...remains his most intriguing -- probably his best -- film.	Storaro and Bertolucci have fashioned a visual masterpiece in The Conformist, with some of the best use of light and shadow ever in a motion picture.	Talvez o melhor filme de Bertolucci, esta obra-prima magnificamente fotografada por Storaro й tгo formidбvel em sua construзгo estйtica e narrativa que cada praticamente todo plano se presta a anбlises longas e profundas.	A commentary on fascism and beauty alike, Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist is acclaimed for its sumptuous visuals and extravagant, artful cinematography.
Kubrick seems to be directing his vision beyond the reality of the Vietnam War to issues far more universal and timeless.	Though shot in the U.K. and thus lacking authentic look and feel, Kubrick's contribution to the Vietnam War films is a powerful chronicle of the military as a bureaucracy that turns young innocent men into machine-like killers.	Many call this the best war film ever, and they're not totally wrong.	...uses a full range of cinematic language to comment on an institution that "eats its own guts" as it destroys foreign cultures.	A hardy Kubrikian effort that warms on you with repeated viewings.	Intense, tightly constructed, and darkly comic at times, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket may not boast the most original of themes, but it is exceedingly effective at communicating them.
While purists may balk at not getting Yuen Woo-ping's complete "vision" here, Iron Monkey manages to make its case, even within the mangled material provided.	Strength lies in its fight sequences, brilliantly choreographed dances made possible with the aide of well-placed wires.	What raises it above the level of conventional children's pulp entertainment is Yuen's dazzlingly choreographed acrobatic high-wire work.	Contains some of the most inspired martial arts sequences ever put on film.	Thrilling choreography makes this Hong Kong fantasy a comedic delight.	Iron Monkey may not have the poetic lyricism of Crouching Tiger, it makes up for it in fun and energy.
An hour and a half of pure agony.	Much like a hunk of rock candy--sort of interesting-looking but ultimately none too fulfilling.	The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is cute and funny, with plenty of slapstick and cuddly creatures for the kids and enough adult wit to keep parents reasonably amused.	There are still some pretty funny lines and gags.	Kids are certain to love The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, but Mom and Dad won't mind going along -- it's a yabba-dabba-delight.	The prequel to the first full-length feature set in Bedrock, Viva Rock Vegas is a surprising improvement over The Flintstones. Aimed towards an audience of adults and children alike, critics feel Viva will appeal to a broad range of viewers.
The Farrelly brothers are fresh out of ideas with this dull effort, a kind of Farrelly Lite. They have replaced intentional bad taste with the unintentional sort.	This is a wildly uneven farce.	Don't expect me to say this too often, but I hope the Farrellys maintain their immaturity, if only because they do it so well.	In delivering their message, the Farrelly Brothers seem to have compromised their nothing-is-sacred comedy spirit, but at least their hearts are in the right place.	tackles the beauty mythos with both humor and sensitivity that may surprise those who think only of body-fluid jokes when they think of the Farrellys	While surprisingly sweeter and warm-hearted than previous Farrelly outings, Shallow Hal is also less funny and more bland.
The Statement elicits more yawns than gasps and plays like a second-rate rerun from Sunday afternoon television.	For the most part, though, there really isn't enough suspense or drama to make The Statement more than an occasionally chilling civics lesson.	It's a shame that a film with this much potential could be turned into such a dull, pedestrian affair.	Ends up being tedious.	not all roses, but it's a decent, well-made thriller of the sort that we don't get much anymore... It's tempting to say that we're getting Caine's best work only now.	The movie bores despite a splendid performance by Michael Caine.
Barnard's boldest move is to unveil the irresponsible chaos of the playwright's private life, and to make us wonder if the art was worth the suffering, after all.	The Arbor is not an easy film, but it's a rewarding one.	Numerous celluloid experiments have fudged reality and fiction lately, but few are as formally inventive or socially revelatory as The Arbor.	This film, which may seem like a niche-interest documentary at first glance, is rich in structural and stylistic innovation of great importance to the genre.	With this bracingly original debut feature, artist Barnard creates one of the most involving and moving documentaries in memory. Stylistically mixing filmmaking approaches, she engulfs us in a fiercely inventive movie experience.	Smart and inventive, The Arbor offers some intensely memorable twists on tired documentary tropes.
A trifling story strung out to great length without much narrative drive, tinged with some disturbing racial undertones.	Supernatural is not much better than subhuman: Hollywood is still, in the year 2000, disinclined to let black actors play human beings.	The problem is that it's about golf.	Accepting the zen of golf is easy. It's The Legend of Bagger Vance and a callow Will Smith as a mystical golf guru that's hard to swallow.	Despite some engaging performances and good scenes, it's by far the least original, and least accomplished, of the six Redford-directed films.	Despite the talent involved in The Legend of Bagger Vance, performances are hindered by an inadequate screenplay full of flat characters and bad dialogue. Also, not much happens, and some critics are offended by how the film glosses over issues of racism.
It's not a pleasant movie, but The Rover twists genre tenets to expose the need for connective tissue that lies somewhere beneath the dark depths of men's souls.	Fusing a hybrid of quasi-apocalyptic influences into a work with a pungent character of its own, The Rover suggests something like a Cormac McCarthy vision of Australia halfway between today and The Road Warrior times.	Take an immensely talented director, a first-class cinematographer, a collection of decidedly gifted actors and film them. Tack on a musical soundtrack that bristles with originality and what do you have? In the case of The Rover, not much.	You might call it a morality play, if there were any morality to speak of at play.	The Rover equals only sporadically the fraught tension of Michôd's debut, Animal Kingdom (2010), but its horrors feel baked-in and genetic.	Fueled by engaging performances from Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson, the tension-filled The Rover overcomes its narrative faults through sheer watchability.
[Nothing] really, except a delivery system for Murphy. But Murphy in those days was appealing enough that this proves to be very nearly sufficient.	Fun sequel	Pointless, hateful sequel.	Not quite as frenetically fun as the original, but Murphy still works his game.	The film seems... to be a precisely timed affair: so many seconds for this, so many for that, and the natural flow of the story be damned.	Eddie Murphy remains appealing as the wisecracking Axel Foley, but Beverly Hills Cop II doesn't take him -- or the viewer -- anywhere new enough to justify a sequel.
[The directors] portray something indelible by capturing the rancher's old-hand ways.	I liked it for 15 minutes or so, and then I found it intolerable.	For those willing to pay attention and get into the rhythms of this stubbornly unconventional movie, the rewards are substantial.	The talk is sheep. And normally, I'd say baa humbug to sitting down with lambs for 90 minutes. But any apprehension. abates under the power of a documentary that's as beautiful as it is informative.	Sweetgrass showcases an elemental intimacy between man and animal.	At once tender and unsentimental, Sweetgrass gracefully captures the beauty and hardships of a dying way of life.
Stunning.	Incredibly beautiful, of course (you may have heard that Malick movies are famous for their landscapes), but it's not "just" beautiful.	Achingly evocative of a time when Hollywood had the courage to invest in complex and morally ambiguous films and an indisputable masterpiece of American cinema.	A fantastic debut by Malick, who has never lived up to the promise since.	Badlands (1973) is the remarkable and impressive directorial debut from twenty-nine year old director Terrence Malick	Terrence Malick's debut is a masterful slice of American cinema, rife with the visual poetry and measured performances that would characterize his work.
Positively sings with color and light.	In the animated worlds of Hayao Miyazaki, the border between the domestic and the magical, between the everyday and the astounding, lies no further away than the nearest broom closet or backyard.	Prepare to be dazzled: Hayao Miyazaki is back.	The film is at its worst when trying to outright engage you and at its best when it doesn't pay the audience much mind.	Those who appreciate Miyazaki's artistry will find much to savor, even in a work that may not rank among the director's best.	Exquisitely illustrated by master animator Miyazaki, Howl's Moving Castle will delight children with its fantastical story and touch the hearts and minds of older viewers as well.
A smart, full-pull filmmaking masterpiece that soars simultaneously on a number of levels.	This weird, often bleak meta-whatsit might be the closest Gonzрlez Iырrritu can come to escapism.	In Birdman, ignorance goes viral.	Put it all together and you've got the year's most original movie to date.	With a glint in his eye and a 'caw!' on his lips, Michael Keaton takes the unexpected opportunity that is Birdman and soars with it.	A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro Gonzрlez Iырrritu, Birdman is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.
A classic case of good old-fashioned American optimism.	Please see this one. Heck, see any Frank Capra movie.	Demonstrates Capra's skill at tweaking the heartstrings as well as the funny bone.	Easily the No. 1 cinema comedy of 1938.	A family of misfits proves that you don't need money to be happy together.	It's predictably uplifting fare from Frank Capra, perhaps the most consciously uplifting of all great American directors -- but thanks to immensely appealing performances and a nimble script, You Can't Take It With You is hard not to love.
From the moment a white horse leaps out of a boy's closet and into his bedroom, this Terry Gilliam fantasy has you hooked. Breathtakingly original and with a surprisingly touching cameo by Sean Connery.	The film's charm rapidly wanes, as it becomes clear that we are bearing witness to a comedy with few jokes and an adventure movie without a sense of joy.	It's a strange and weird and wonderful mix of boy's own adventure, Python-esque humor, and grim irony, all wrapped in tall tales, ancient myths, and historical figures.	A cheerfully irreverent lark -- part fairy tale, part science fiction and part comedy.	An intoxicating dose of children's entertainment of the rarest and weirdest and most delirious kind.	Time Bandits is a remarkable time-travel fantasy from Terry Gilliam, who utilizes fantastic set design and homemade special effects to create a vivid, original universe.
...a satisfying biopic that gets the job done efficiently and without much fanfare	Rush hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they're cheating death.	Exhilarating in parts and immensely moving in others, Rush will trigger a host of emotions from the viewer!	This is entertaining enough, but ultimately it's spuriously triumphant Oscar-baiting fluff.	The thriller tells us all we need to know about the real-life champion Formula 1 rivals in the early 1970s.	A sleek, slick, well-oiled machine, Rush is a finely crafted sports drama with exhilarating race sequences and strong performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl.
'Biutiful' is not one of the year's five best films, but Javier Bardem's performance may very well be.	Boasts quality of acting and an overall intensity level that make up for a lot of narrative shortcomings.	It's the kind of film that congratulates the viewer on her tolerance for the spectacle of unrelieved misery.	This bloated drama is redeemed by its focus of a man caught between two distinctive and memorable worlds.	"Biutiful," built around an immense performance by Javier Bardem, is yet another, albeit sparer, Iырrritu gloom-fest.	Javier Bardem's searing performance helps to elevate Biutiful, as does Alejandro Gonzαlez Iραrritu's craftsmanship, but the film often lapses into contrivance and grimness.
Whether or not "Katyn" is one of Wajda's masterpieces is a subject for discussion; it's clearly the work of a master filmmaker, possibly at a late peak of his long career.	Wajda, as you would expect from a director with an illustrious career who has lived through the turbulent and changing times of his homeland, proves himself adept at showing individuals at the mercy of history.	With exceptional commitment and artistry, Wajda's politically engaged filmmaking vividly brings Poland's tortured travails through the 20th century to the world's attention.	Director Andrzej Wajda, who contributed to the screenplay, treats the topic with as much gravitas as you would expect, but it occasionally feels like a history lesson	Superbly directed and powerfully emotional, this is a harrowing wartime drama that demands to be seen.	Masterfully crafted by an experienced directorial hand, Katyn is a powerful, personal depiction of wartime tragedy.
An unusual romance with minimal dialogue.	Alternately witty, caustic, tender and endlessly imaginative and unpredictable, this latest film from one of Korea's most idiosyncratic and prolific directors is as confident as its resourceful hero, Tae-suk.	Kim Ki-duk's touching and improbable love story is pleasingly mysterious without being too difficult and a little gimmicky but not annoyingly so.	3-Iron est un autre bel ajout ŕ l'univers plus serein de Kim Ki-duk.	So lyrical is the movie in its wordlessness that it is practically a dance piece. And for a movie essentially without dialogue, it gives audiences plenty to talk about.	A tender and moving romance from Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring's director Kim Ki-Duk.
Unlike most of the usual rolling hills, costume period drama, Merchant-Ivory type, century-old novel movies, Sense and Sensibility succeeds quite handily.	A host of fine performances support the great screenplay, photography and editing of the film.	A heartfelt story, filled with rich characters and compelling events.	The movie is good fun, boasting a dozen vivid characters and two that moviegoers will take to heart.	A soap opera of the highest caliber.	Sense and Sensibility is an uncommonly deft, very funny Jane Austen adaptation, marked by Emma Thompson's finely tuned performance.
The funniest film of the summer!	Best of all it's got Pullman, Fonda, Platt, and Gleeson and it's very, very funny.	An old-hat but somehow still fresh horror-comedy that wins its audience over by the personalities onscreen.	Filled with just the right measure of special effects; has talk which is clever, witty, sharp, edgy.	An odd, derivative, but sporadically likeable film.	Faux horror schtick fails to elicit any laughs or scares.
Music of the Heart doesn't take you anywhere you haven't been before, but it's still an enjoyable ride.	Not exactly what we'd hoped for, but no worse, I think, than could be expected.	Most movies claiming to be based on fact pour on the melodrama, but this one basically just sticks to the real story, which has all the emotional wallop that's needed.	Meryl dominates the proceedings. She simply disappears into the role, and the movie, for all its educational impulses, becomes about watching her do it.	Music of the Heart is a story of the heart - one that gives a little reassurance about human nature.	Meryl Streep's depiction of an ordinary person doing extraordinary things transcends, inspires, and entertains.
Laden with more useless pork than a congressional bill.	Would anyone go for a sequel to The Wizard of Oz that catapulted Dorothy and Toto into the world of Once Were Warriors or Escape From New York?	Grounding all the mayhem in emotional priority is the little pig that could.	This dark sequel to the 1995 hit has virtually none of the bucolic charm displayed in the original.	So distressingly dark, grim, and cynical it's likely to make kids cry!	Not quite as good as the original and has some dark subject material that might not be appropriate for children.
Summer Hours meanders along as a restrained mood piece, and is quite good and moving in parts, but it's just plain flat in others.	Performances in this small and profoundly eloquent film are superb, yet none redirects attention from Assayas's earnest meditation on the ravaging effects of a shrinking world on family traditions and entrenched personal relationships.	manages a sense of genuine poignancy that never becomes sticky or sentimental	The cast is outstanding; the three siblings, played by Berling, Binoche and Renier, deliver an ensemble performance of great complexity, yet with clearly defined characters.	Hats off to Olivier Assayas's plain yet hauntingly beautiful Summer Hours, a true -- albeit nonsecular -- meditation on art and eternal life.	Olivier Assayas' contemplative family drama handles lofty ideas about art and culture with elegance and lightness.
So preposterously entertaining that it makes watching other recent Hollywood action spectacles feel like work.	"Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol" is sheer hurtling mechanism-and it's great silly fun.	Bird relishes the chance to play with real people - the central suspense sequence, in which Hunt scales Dubai's Burj Khalifa one-handed, is dizzyingly effective, particularly in IMAX - and the pace rarely slows.	It's fast and furious the whole way, and there's a lot to look at.	Cruise has matured and so has his elaborate spy game, dialing down the gritty paranoia to make room for audacious missions of survival and retrieval, finding plenty of invention and elasticity left in the franchise.	Stylish, fast-paced, and loaded with gripping set pieces, the fourth Mission: Impossible is big-budget popcorn entertainment that really works.
Crowe goes against type in rendering Braddock as a man full of humility and generosity.	Apes the Rocky series, lifting bits and pieces from all five installments...I begged for Baer to shout in his best Mr. T voice, 'I pity the fool'	The Best Actor Oscar race starts now.	A superbly acted, beautifully shot, highly engaging drama that ranks as one of Howard's best efforts.	A tad bipolar, Cinderella Man's still remarkable film making...Russell Crowe is again, master and commander of what it is he does so well.	With grittiness and an evocative sense of time and place, Cinderella Man is a powerful underdog story. And Ron Howard and Russell Crowe prove to be a solid combination.
[Woody] Allen brings his fantasy to life with such affection and joy that he transports us into his dream come true as a shared fantasy.	...a charming bon-bon, a bookend to his "Purple Rose of Cairo." But it is also a refreshing take to hear the septuagenarian filmmaker who has shown a predilection for embracing the past push an alter ego so firmly into the future.	Breezy and casually profound, with a killer gimmick that keeps on giving.	The magic of Paris and the mystique of an era gone-by are the stars of Midnight in Paris - Woody Allen's best film for years	This combination of whimsy and romance is, for me, much more successful than Allen's previous European city film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona.	It may not boast the depth of his classic films, but the sweetly sentimental Midnight in Paris is funny and charming enough to satisfy Woody Allen fans.
Even though it may not stand among Almodóvar's best, it's still a wildly enjoyable, sumptuous, and rewarding film.	While it doesn't pack the emotional heft of director Pedro Almodvar's most moving films, such as Volver, it is stylish and arresting, with powerful performances and a compelling, if at times contrived, story.	The film may lack great depth, but it is a visual treat about films within films and packed with top performances.	Broken Embraces is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside a slightly overindulgent parade of gushing film references.	While some of Almodóvar's films are out-and-out heartbreakers - perfect storms of melodrama, storytelling and extreme living - this is a more cerebral, self-reflective and noir-ish affair.	Pedro Almodovar's fourth film with Penélope Cruz isn't his finest work, but he brings his signature visual brilliance to this noirish tale, and the cast turns in some first-class performances.
La película realmente triunfa en la exploración de la complicidad y solidaridad que se establece entre mujeres solas, quebradas, necesitadas de oportunidades e inconformes con los moldes sociales preestablecidos.	This is a case where the dynamic between the white and black characters informs the premise of the film, and they gain strength and courage from each other. This is no one-way transaction.	A chore to sit through. At 146 minutes long, there is absolutely no excusing the running time... a panoply of lazy bromides.	Poignant, thought-provoking Civil Rights tale.	The performances in this movie are so spectacular that it made my analytical eye fill with tears for the triumphs and sorrows of the people on the screen.	Though arguably guilty of glossing over its racial themes, The Help rises on the strength of its cast -- particularly Viola Davis, whose performance is powerful enough to carry the film on its own.
The über-villain is played, very tragically indeed, by poor Eric Roberts, brother of Julia, and he walks and talks as if his head has been used for kickboxing practice.	It's got hot babes in bikinis kung-fu fighting - what more do you want of a movie?	Unquestionably brain-dead, but also a great example of unpretentious, second-gear celluloid, generated quickly, cheaply -- and for the fun of it.	Quantcast The plot is but an excuse for a series of elaborately choreographed fight sequences featuring a combination of digital and wire work that somehow manages to feel completely fake despite the obvious physical exertions of its well-trained cast.	The performances are so wooden that things improve when Eric frickin' Roberts turns up with a bad wig.	With a ridiculous plot and comical acting, checking one's brain at the door is required before watching DOA: Dead or Alive.
Not only Roger Moore's best, but one of the few Bond films that can stand apart from the series as a superb action movie.	With its comic edge, this is one of the better Bonds.	The best of the Roger Moore Bond films has much to praise.	Of Roger Moore's seven James Bond pictures, The Spy Who Loved Me stands out as the best.	In a tremendous film that shows Moore's Bond still has the old razzle-dazzle, "Nobody Does It Better" isn't just a theme song. It's a forceful and fun statement of purpose, and "Spy" offers the franchise the definitive jolt it so sorely needed.	Though it hints at the absurdity to come in later installments, The Spy Who Loved Me's sleek style, menacing villains, and sly wit make it the best of the Roger Moore era.
Corbijn's film serves as an undeniably powerful vehicle for newcomer Riley; his looks and his vocals are a dead ringer for Curtis', and the anguish he brings to bear on the last weeks of Curtis' life is frighteningly palpable.	Control is that rare greatest-hits package that makes you want to go back and explore a band's entire discography, and moreover, that razes the cliches and renders their history as new, fresh and interesting as when it originally happened.	Far from the fierce social consciousness of Mike Leigh, Control's images, if not its equally arresting performances, suggest a kitchen sink scrubbed clean.	At least Control does right by the doting wife, typically given the shaft in these movies as simply victim and toss-away, here played as heartbreakingly courageous by two-time Oscar nominee Samantha Morton (third times the charm?).	Control seems an honest tribute to a haggard ghost. It'll inspire many a young viewer looking for tips about the workings of self-torture and famous doom.	Control is a work of art, thanks to its evocative black and white cinematography and sensational performances from Sam Riley and Samantha Morton. Even those not familiar with Joy Division can still appreciate the beauty of the film.
At the center of the film -- the real reason it was made -- is Binoche, one of the genuinely radiant presences in movies today.	Code Unknown is a film that will thrill connoisseurs of alienation and loneliness, and I say that with the utmost sincerity.	Worthy, challenging, heavily art-house-centric feature that explores ideas of immigration, communication, xenophobia and representations of reality within fiction.	Beautifully shot and acted, particularly by Juliette Binoche.	This is a brilliantly done art-house film, offering a detached view of immigration according to the way an outsider sees it.	Though challengingly cryptic at times, Code Unknown still manages to resonate.
This is interesting stuff. So why does The Last Stand feel driven to dumb itself down, as if embarrassed by its own ideas?	It's a mutant smorgasbord, and most of the characters suffer as a result. 'We need more mutants in leather,' I can hear a studio exec yelling. 'And give them tattoos too! That way we know they're bad guys!'	Wolverine takes it personally when hit below the belt with a sucker punch. As a paying audience member, so should you. It's a vending-machine movie all the way, with none of the mood, charm or style that has preceded it.	For a movie that promotes unity, it is awfully splintered in its storytelling. It lacks a core plot to link the set pieces and create a sense of momentum.	[The Last Stand is] by far the daftest of the lot, and the one in which the stars' contractual fatigue is evident in the number of major characters who meet their demise before the first couple of reels are up.	X-Men: The Last Stand provides plenty of mutant action for fans of the franchise, even if it does so at the expense of its predecessors' deeper character moments.
An origins tale that's a true comic novel of a movie, "X-Men: First Class" boasts CGI action and character development that provides a nifty origins foundation for the series.	Even without making the honor roll, "X-Men: First Class" has earned a pass for future semesters.	While the whole film is professionally executed and goes down smoothly enough, the underlying stupidity of its subject matter can't help but show through in the end.	Both silliness and sap increase as the film rolls along, but the big action scenes are handled well, and it never becomes ridiculous enough to undercut the cool, shaken-not-stirred vibe of its first half.	Lacking a single memorable joke or striking image, First Class is as perfunctory and passionless as would-be franchise resurrections get.	With a strong script, stylish direction, and powerful performances from its well-rounded cast, X-Men: First Class is a welcome return to form for the franchise.
We've already seen the fantastic March of the Penguins and Murderball,but Grizzly Man also needs to be included in discussion of possible Oscar contenders	A tremendous achievement, despite its niggling flaws.	If grizzly man Timothy didn't die, the film most likely would not have been made.	This is shaping up to be another great year for documentaries and this is one of the best.	A character study of a passionate, driven, eccentric man, who, for Herzog, embodies the tragic impossibility of the human condition.	Whatever opinion you come to have of the obsessive Treadwell, Herzog has once again found a fascinating subject.
The best Israeli film since Late Marriage, this classic Wedding saga about a complex political situation on the Syrian-Israeli border never loses sight of its humanism	It's a lovely little film that puts a big, big bite on some very large issues.	The movie charms while making a bold statement about the borders that governments and individuals construct to keep each other apart.	All politics is personal, but rarely has that credo been illustrated so winningly as with Eran Riklis' delicate comedy about the maddening intersection of families, cultures and borders.	Comes by its sweetness honestly. And while multinationalism is no guarantee of quality, this film is a true multinational affair.	A humane and empathic work, The Syrian Bride depicts the personal impact of politics upon individuals.
Terribly lame humour don't help.	For maximum entertainment, a movie can't afford to waste so much time being its own carnival barker, relentlessly trying to drum up interest.	If you don't think Kevin Kline in drag is funny, wait 'til you see Will Smith in drag -- it's even less funny.	Basically, what you see in the trailer is what you get, and nothing more.	For pure summer escapism, you could do far worse.	Bombastic, manic, and largely laugh-free, Wild Wild West is a bizarre misfire in which greater care was lavished upon the special effects than on the script.
I'm not sure exactly why I'm protecting the Shocking Twist, because it certainly doesn't deserve to be protected.	...this gothic thriller is regrettably about as terrifying as an episode of PBS's Frontier House.	It's the lack of a genuine wizard behind the curtain that robs The Village of much of its suspense, but the movie has merits that go beyond goosebumps.	Shyamalan has followed his own template, but neglected to fill in the most important parts. The movie is a disappointment.	Those who give themselves to this film, beautifully lensed with a fine performance by newcomer Howard, will have the pleasure of rewinding the early reels in their mind.	The Village is appropriately creepy, but Shyamalan's signature twist ending disappoints.
Unlike the food, the movie's central drama takes a while to heat up, but offers lovely rewards at the end.	Eat Drink Man Woman may not just amuse and entertain you. It's likely to make you very hungry, too-perhaps for more than food.	Ang Lee's two-generational soap opera displays the most elaborate food preparation and the most delectable meals since Like Water for Chocolate.	Although the prime influence on Lee's stately style and several of the film's themes is the Japanese genius Yasujiro Ozu, there is more than a hint of Woody Allen in this complex ensemble comedy.	Eat Drink Man Woman is a delicacy but also something more -- something like food for the heart.	A richly layered look at the complex interactions between a widowed chef and his daughters, Ang Lee's generational comedy Eat Drink Man Woman offers filmgoers a tasty cinematic treat.
Director Jim Jarmusch tests the limits of our patience with this indulgent, minimalist exercise that all adds up to nothing.	This is indulgent filmmaking at its most pretentious.	One character talks about molecules moving around in ecstasy, and I think this film has that kind of mystery.	I once saw an exhibit at an art museum that was a separate room where the noise and light would increase until you couldn't take it anymore. Similar feeling here.	The medium is the message in this slow but sure road piece. Little action and almost no dialog emphasize the seductive photography and make a film that keeps moving in spite of itself.	A minimalist exercise in not much of anything, The Limits of Control is a tedious viewing experience with little reward.
...juvenile at best and flat-out lame at worst...	click to read review (though I have no idea why you'd want to)	A painful regurgitation of memorable moments from recent Hollywood blockbusters, the spoof film Epic Movie is almost entirely devoid of laughs.	Epic Movie strays so far from the solid fundamentals of filmmaking that it calls the very foundation of humor into question.	Everything you loved about the past couple of years' blockbusters, only much less entertaining and with a lot more urination.	A crude comedy with nothing new or insightful to say about the subjects it satirizes.
The true story of a talented Hawaiian surfer who demonstrates great courage in the face of a setback to her dreams and discovers how she is meant to serve.	Sure, the film has its mawkish moments, but it's a remarkable, well-intentioned tale that deserves to ride its wave rather than to wipe out on it.	Faith-based...With its sports-movie structure and Hollywood production values, Soul Surfer is a creditable crossover picture; it just could've done with more nuance. [Blu-ray]	It's a compelling tale of surf and survival.	This is an inspirational sports drama stuffed full of Christian values and CGI that draws the eye in ways both good and bad.	There's an amazing true story at the heart of Soul Surfer -- and unfortunately, it's drowned by waves of Hollywood cheese.
Room 237 is both an ode to the subversive nature of the movies and a fascinating insight into clashing obsessions in its most lurid form, even when its stylistic choices seek to destroy the experience.	There's enough real evidence supporting the theory that Kubrick was a genius, and that's pretty entertaining all by itself.	It's nuts, in the best possible way.	Powered by a deep and abiding affection for both The Shining and Kubrick in general, Room 237 is an amuse-bouche of remix culture.	This geek gossip is made even more captivating by the fact that nobody will likely ever know whether any of it is true.	Mysterious and provocative, Room 237 is a fascinating journey into the world of obsessive cinephilles.
A fascinating survey of the events leading up to the scandal and the sad results that followed.	This serious movie puts some points on the scoreboard with its messages about gamblers who corrupt the sport and players who drag the game through the mud with their greed.	[Sayles] makes the audience an expert on the era and the incident.	One of the best sports movies of all time.	he gist of t'The situation is probably captured accurately.	Perhaps less than absorbing for non-baseball fans, but nevertheless underpinned by strong performances from the cast and John Sayles' solid direction.
Between occasional guffaws and more frequent hand-over-mouth, oh-my-God moments, I started to think about where American comedy has come from and where it's going.	In Step Brothers, Nancy (Mary Steenburgen) is the ideal audience, the girl who can't fathom the anti-nuances of masculine ritual.	As Step Brother plays out, the expected comedy about perma-boys Ferrell and Reilly blends with a borderline horror-movie about the poor parents who are stuck with them.	You'll laugh a ton, but you might also feel that you can have too much of a good thing.	There's enough inventive hairy chested Peter Pan pretend preteen malice and ballsy kid impersonation, to sustain the laughs for the duration. Think Superbad with ample doses of talking dirty sibling revelry.	The relentless immaturity of the humor is not a total handicap for this film, which features the consistently well-matched talents of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly.
These are sight gags best appreciated with a blindfold.	It's hard to see through the utter mess that is Date Movie enough to evaluate its acting, but Hannigan seems to be at least serviceable.	It's a uniquely unappetizing combination of unfunny material and unfunny performances.	The comedy seems to have been more typed than written, in that the point of such parody, which is to (1) borrow characters from other works and then (2) do something funny with them , has pretty much been ignored, at least as far as (2) goes.	Repulsive and repugnant film, filled with bet-we-can-make-you-puke moments, it basically dares you not to run out of the theater screaming.	In an attempt to parody rom-com cliches, Date Movie ultimately makes a mockery of itself, with juvenile toilet humor and empty pop culture references.
Both are about one notch off in their impersonation of "ordinary" people - it reminded me of Streep and De Niro in Falling in Love. Nothing offensive about it, apart from its sense of London geography.	Feigns serious interest in the trickiness of later-in-life love while indulging in corny humor and even worse bathos.	There's not a believable minute in the 92 minutes of Last Chance Harvey, but Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson smooth over most of the problems just by showing up and doing what they do for a living.	A low-key, predictable but no less enjoyable romantic comedy.	It's wonderful to watch young people falling in love for the first time. But it is even more wonderful to see people falling in love for the last time.	Last Chance Harvey is an above-average story that graduates to potent romantic drama based on the chemistry and charm of its top-notch performers.
There are still puke jokes in 'Adventureland' as there were in 'Superbad,' but it's nice to see that Mottola can help viewers get in touch with another body function, the beat of a heart.	Observant, soulful, often achingly attuned to clashing emotions	I'm sure the film will have a certain appeal to a certain audience, namely other college-aged kids in crappy jobs struggling to learn about life and love.	Adventureland is one of the best films of the year because it sticks by its own heart.	Mottola manages to avoid the cliches and create characters with warmth and specificity and -- that rarest quality in movies of this genre -- some grace	Full of humor and nostalgia, Adventureland is a sweet, insightful coming-of-age comedy that will resonate with teens and adults alike.
...so overstuffed with heavy themes and convoluted plot lines that it barely manages to squeeze in the requisite gags about canine flatulence.	There were plenty of fart jokes and dog burps to make my kids laugh.	Todd Holland's film manipulates the prickly issues with scant regard for emotional credibility. The sentimentality is ghastly, but Rex has his moments.	Rin Tin Tin would never have okayed a script like this.	throws most of its well-chewed bones to the youngest of patrons and treats ticket-purchasing parents like hydrants.	Firehouse Dog's cute premise is ruined with endless fart and poop jokes, and an overlong run time.
Considered the red headed stepchild of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise, but beyond the obvious missteps, it's a very fun outing that truly doesn't deserve its bad rap.	The movie lurches, wheezes and misfires throughout, with a clunky pace more suited to those who live life one Quarter Pounder at a time.	A meathead movie with no subtext at all.	Even amid the formulaic romancing of boys and girls and above all, cars, the movie takes up the concept of "drift" as metaphor, ideology, and aesthetic.	So what if the movie dumbs down Japanese culture to a bad yakuza movie and features Japanese characters who can barely speak Japanese? The cars are the stars here. Everything else is lost in translation.	Eye-popping driving sequences coupled with a limp story and flat performances make this Drift an adequate follow-up to the previous Fast and Furious installments. Strictly for the racing crowd and fans of the first two films.
These words and these stories may still resonate with any woman who has struggled to love herself enough to expect and deserve love from others.	Monologues and melodrama rarely work in contemporary movies exploring social ills.	While gunning for the same empowering vibe as Waiting To Exhale, enduring this miserable effort from Tyler Perry is more like praying to expire.	The audience I saw it with didn't seem to know whether to clap when it was over or start taking Lipitor.	Perry uses a very heavy hand to create melodrama when the material is dramatic enough.	Tyler Perry has assembled a fine cast for this adaptation of the 1975 play, and his heart is obviously in the right place, but his fondness for melodrama cheapens a meaningful story.
Number Five is the real star of this energetic film. Sheedy, Guttenberg and company are just supporting players.	The human actors are secondary, for the real star of the show is Number 5. He's really pretty charming, though his unusual antics aren't enough to carry a feature-length motion picture.	The movie, which has the clean, well-scrubbed look of an old Disney comedy, is nicely acted by Miss Sheedy, who demonstrates a light-comedy touch not unlike Amy Irving's [and] Mr. Guttenberg.	Looking back at it today it's clear that Short Circuit is absolutely awful, and not just because of Ally Sheedy's haircut.	Amiable enough, but...	Amiable and good-natured but also shallow and predictable, Short Circuit is hardly as deep or emotionally resonant as E.T. -- though Johnny Five makes for a charming robot protagonist.
A film that, in bare description, sounds like the greatest outrage ever put to screen, but ends up being fairly tedious when watched.	[M]ight as well be compiled from Nazi footage of human medical experiments, for all its casualness...	It's not a film I can recommend except to those who fully know what they're getting themselves into, but it's also effective and professional enough that it can't be immediately dismissed.	Basically an unremarkable innocents-captured-by-maniac thriller that happens to have one perverse idea as its central gimmick.	I's at times heart-racingly tense, less gory than you'd expect, hilarious, horrible, and not like anything else you've ever seen.	Grotesque, visceral and hard to (ahem) swallow, this surgical horror doesn't quite earn its stripes because the gross-outs overwhelm and devalue everything else.
A romantic comedy that stubbornly refuses to play by the rules, 'Amelie' could be this generation's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.'	I like my films to be more intellectual and less like French pastry.	The sort of magical work that reminds us how truly fine movies at their best can be.	Sometimes it's enough to attend the cinema to escape to another world	Jeunet's lavish, hyperactive, romantic whimsy is now the gooiest dish on the cinema menu. You will need a very sweet tooth to take it. In fact, you may need a tooth of pure sucrose, not to mention gums of marzipan and a jawbone of sherbet.	The feel-good Amelie is a lively, fanciful charmer, showcasing Audrey Tautou as its delightful heroine.
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is the sort of cheerfully asinine comedy that twists your arm until you submit. So, to Will Ferrell -- clown, freak, bully -- I scream, 'Uncle!'	Most comedies these days try too hard to be funny. Talladega Nights simply tries to be funny without being obvious.	Some of the jokes here are funny. Most are not, while the characters are simply too silly to make us give two hoots about them. Worse, the movie collapses under the weight of a ton of syrup in the second half.	The picture gets a bit long near the finish. But comedies live and die on the basis of their laugh quotient, and Talladega Nights gets its share.	The first third is the movie at its best--it has the looseness of improvisation. The second half is a struggle, but McKay recovers nicely toward the end, where so many stereotypes are eventually run down by the script.	Though it occasionally stalls, Talladega Nights' mix of satire, clever gags, and excellent ensemble performances put it squarely in the winner's circle.
It will be argued that Time Code is more of a techno-stunt than a dramatic experience, but the stories turn out to be surprisingly affecting.	The story is not the thing in Time Code. It's the way in which it is told that makes this one so intriguing.	Great work, a good film.	There's a lot to see in Timecode. Unfortunately, there's not a lot that's interesting.	From a technical standpoint, it's a sheer marvel.	Not much of a story, but the execution is interesting.
Truthful, intelligent and likely to ignite many useful conversations.	A masterpiece that deserves to be watch and discussed.	The straddling of styles [realism vs. fable] weakens, but doesn't destroy a strong film.	Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on.	[Helmer Paul Haggis] needs to develop a firmer hand on his own work to really shine.	A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, Crash examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos.
Ides tells familiar tale well.	What remains is your classic compromise candidate: a film that set out with a crusading zeal but had its rough edges planed down en route to the nomination.	Yet another fantastic performance from Ryan Gosling, in what has turned out to be his breakout year that elevates him to the top rank of actors.	One of the year's most intensely chilling films.	A multi-faceted drama that's simple enough for the masses but accomplished enough that few critics could succeed in smearing it.	While not exactly exposing revelatory truths, The Ides of March is supremely well-acted drama that moves at a measured, confident clip.
For reliving this long forgotten go-and-get-it gung-ho mentality and excellent reconstruction of the sense of wonder that surrounded those early space missions Apollo 13 is worth seeing.	A movie for the ages.	A brilliant balance between true-life accuracy and movie-time excitement.	Apollo 13, one of the most exciting adventure movies of the year, proves that science history can be just as thrilling as science fiction.	This engrossing account of the nation's most perilous moon shot embodies what many people consider to be old-fashioned American virtues in a virtually pristine state.	In recreating the troubled space mission, Apollo 13 pulls no punches: it's a masterfully told drama from director Ron Howard, bolstered by an ensemble of solid performances.
...truly dismal...This is a movie to avoid.	If an easy watch is what you're after this will do the trick, simply keep expectations at a modest level and it won't be a waste of time.	...may be set in Bora-Bora, but it's about as much fun as a lock down with an obsessive religious cult.	It's one bland scene after another, played at medium pace with middling creativity, punctuated with a near-desperate attempt at a laugh	Those involved got to spend weeks at a Bora Bora luxury resort; all we get is this not lousy but unmemorable tropical-vacation comedy.	Despite a talented cast and some reliably pleasant interplay between Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, Couples Retreat leaves viewers stranded in an arid, mirthless comedy.
[L]eaves very little for fun here beyond guffawing at the outrageous caricature of dangerous sexiness that pop culture inflated [Catherine] into...	For many people, the only reason to see Basic Instinct 2 is to find out if Stone uncrosses her legs again. She doesn't.	Basic Instinct 2 isn't quite the spurting geyser of sexual excess that the original was, but it has a sense of reservation and a rather graceful desire for worth that makes it an acceptable distraction.	...a script that is so full of cliche's that I actually knew the end of the film 10 minutes before it ended.	Trust your basic instinct and avoid the worst sequel since Staying Alive.	Unable to match the suspense and titilation of its predecessor, Basic Instinct 2 boasts a plot so ludicrous and predictable it borders on "so-bad-it's-good."
This is documentary filmmaking quite unlike any other: a tale of triumph over adversity, of victory and tragedy, visually presented as riveting, explosive drama. Senna is essential viewing.	Undeniably gripping stuff.	"Senna" is a streamlined piece of filmmaking, completely immersing the viewer in Senna's world and never losing momentum as it moves from one breakneck race to another.	Kapadia fosters a distinct 'you are there' feeling for the races by composing his visual storytelling entirely of vintage footage, mostly derived from the Formula One archives.	Kapadia is working with an embarrassment of riches, but to his credit he selects wisely, and has the good sense to keep the talking heads off the screen.	Even for filmgoers who aren't racing fans, Senna offers heart-pounding thrills -- and heartbreaking emotion.
From bumbling infants to majestic adults, a flock hasn't been this charismatic onscreen since Hitchcock went bird-watching.	It's a movie about dreamers that, for once, doesn't make you feel like a sap for buying into their dreams.	Beautiful looking and well acted, but lacking in the kind of tension that marks a well-told tale.	Daniels, in a scruffy beard and wearing the apologetic look of a divorced dad who hasn't visited his kid enough, hasn't been this good in a long time.	Somehow makes the story of orphaned geese entertaining.	Well-acted and beautifully filmed, Fly Away Home offers heartwarming entertainment for moviegoers of all ages.
Nothing, however, can really prepare audiences for the generally good, though offbeat, performances, gritty action and serio-comic exploits of the Good Guys vs. the Bad Guys.	At center is the first big, juicy mythic-hero part Gibson has had since Mad Max.	A pistol-packing, snap-crackling blow-out.	Lethal Weapon is a film teetering on the brink of absurdity when it gets serious, but thanks to its unrelenting energy and insistent drive, it never quite falls.	The film is all fast action, noisy stunts and huge, often unflattering close-ups, but it packs an undeniable wallop.	The most successful installment in a phenomenally successful series, Lethal Weapon helped redefine action movies for the 1980s and 1990s.
This 1997 thriller is fairly entertaining nonsense if all you're looking for is 128 minutes of diversion. But if you'd like something more from David Fincher, the director of Seven, don't get your hopes up.	The film's 'message' about complacency transformed by chaos and uncertainty is hackneyed...	Fincher's worthy and equally dark follow-up to Seven.	[N]ifty filmic style and crackpot sensibility.	A crowd-pleasing pip most of the way.	The ending could use a little work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling.
A more fitting tribute to William Castle would have been to create a horror flick you could sit through without consistently squirming in abject loathing.	It's junk, too, and while maybe it's not as much fun as the original, neither does it disgrace its parent.	You don't like to see someone like F. Murray Abraham awkwardly hamming his way through a role. It's actually pretty sad.	The original was pretty crappy. The remake is not an improvement.	By any objective accounting, Thirteen Ghosts is exactly a baker's dozen too many -- this is a zero of a film.	The production design is first rate, but 13 Ghosts is distinctly lacking in scares.
Loosely based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, Less Than Zero refuses to take the risks necessary to capture the keen social observation of the book.	a bit of a mess	The quality of dislocation in Marek Kanievska's Less Than Zero is startling and sinister.	The only saving grace of this exercise in futility is the suitably louche performance by Spader as drug-dealer Rip.	It may not be the most realistic portrayal of drug addiction ever produced, but it's certainly worth seeing - if for nothing else than Downey's superlative performance.	A couple of standout performances -- notably Robert Downey, Jr. and James Spader -- and a killer soundtrack can't quite elevate a somewhat superficial adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' story of drugged-out LA rich kids.
The final tally: four stars for Jackie Chan, no stars for director Brett Ratner, and minus two stars for Chris Tucker, giving the film a total of two.	About half as much fun as the original, and for August, that's probably good enough.	Despite Tucker's valiant energy and Chan's ever-game clowning, just not as funny as the original.	A workman-like exercise that's not half as funny or fun as the first one.	If Chris Tucker ever comes to my house for dinner, he'd better bring some aspirin.	Rush Hour 2 doesn't feel as fresh or funny as the first, and the stunts lack some of the intricacy normally seen in Chan's films.
Time was when movie-makers, even laws-unto- themselves such as Sam Peckinpah, could be trusted to examine the consequences of living every moment in mortal danger: violence meant something more to them than simple connoisseurship.	Really, there will be no reason for anyone to make a comic-book movie ever again. Miller and Rodriguez have pushed the form as far as it can possibly go.	Clichéd characters mutter dated noir dialogue through sadistic stories you can predict in your sleep.	About as close to geek heaven as a film adaptation has ever been.	Batman would get his butt kicked in Sin City ...	Visually groundbreaking and terrifically violent, Sin City brings the dark world of Frank Miller's graphic novel to vivid life.
No movement, no yuks, not much of anything.	The whole affair is as predictable as can be.	It's still a hoot, sports cliches, prison movie cliches and all.	The formula is familiar but enjoyable.	On its own, it's not very interesting. As a remake, it's a pale imitation.	Despite some genuine wit, this crowd pleaser is filled with too many cliches.
What would "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold" be with a different narrator-guide? It is hard to imagine. Mr. Spurlock has the gift of gab along with an undeniable star quality.	It's product placement on steroids, or supersized, as he might have called it	Spurlock is still inserting himself into stupid game-show-style situations, but this time his target is so juicy we're inclined to forgive him.	There wasn't a moment in the film when I wasn't involved or even amused by what I saw. But afterward, I was left with a big pile of "So what?"	Spurlock says he's not selling out, he's buying in. I'm buying into Spurlock. As ever, he makes you laugh till it hurts.	The Greatest Movie Ever Sold plays smartly to Spurlock's strengths, and the result is a breezy, albeit not particularly enlightening documentary.
In the end, John Tucker is a lot like high school: I'll look back on it with a smile, but I'm glad it's behind me.	Painless but forgettable.	One of the unheralded guilty pleasures of inane teen sex comedies comes from watching middle-aged filmmakers haplessly attempt to gauge the pulse of teen America.	When we have savvy, smart TV shows like Veronica Mars, which perfectly and cleverly capture the angst and tribulations of high school life, there's absolutely no need for empty-headed, vapid movies like this.	If we're going to abandon any sense of storytelling or intelligence, couldn't we at the very least do it with cheerful cardboard cutouts? Nice people can be dumb too.	This derivitive teen comedy tries to go for cute when it could use more bite.
He's just another cheap icon, set not to haunt our worst nightmares, but the cash-cow dreams of a studio looking for a franchise player.	An origins movie that follows the serial killer's early years. As you might expect, those years didn't involve much time in a sandbox, unless of course Hannibal's spade was used as an instrument of death.	The more we learn about the bogeyman, the less terrifying he becomes.	As played by French actor Gaspard Ulliel, Hannibal is a playing-card joker: Ulliel performs every scene with the same dimpled smirk, which looks less like an expression than a plastic-surgery mistake.	This horribly ill-conceived project is fake from start to finish, without a moment recognisable as real, and the story is often so badly told as to be laughable.	Hannibal Rising reduces the horror icon to a collection of dime-store psychological traits.
The film's shock storyline soon becomes a dull plod.	[VIDEO] "Little Otik is in a class all by itself. Jan Svankmajer is a mad genius of cinema."	A sublime, blacker-than-night comic meditation on the insistent demands of a youngster's love and the complete loss of control inherent in starting a family.	Unfortunately, at more than two hours, all of this is a bit too much.	The resulting caricaturish effect, coupled with a story line that repeats its basics over and over again for more than two hours, damage this potentially droll look at ungoverned urges and tyke tyranny beyond salvaging.	Though rather overlong, Little Otik is a whimsical, bizarre treat.
It's very refreshing to see a movie that celebrates writing and intelligence without stooping to become a filmed record of a novel.	A scattershot affair that bobbles along episodically but doesn't quite gel.	An unexpectedly winning movie that deals with real people and recognizable problems in an honest, entertaining manner.	[Michael Douglas] is a superb comic actor, one who knows that the secret of being funny is never begging for a laugh.	...a movie of small pleasures and gentle comedy. One has to be careful not to overpraise it.	Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire do wonders in this clever dark comedy.
Bellocchio has taken a little known piece of history...and filmed it with an expressionistic style that can be dramatically operatic but also frustratingly abstract.	An occasionally exhilarating retelling of a fascinating, little-known story. And how Mezzogiorno missed awards consideration is a mystery.	Vincere is big on visual gestures, and many of them are stunning. But the most powerful moments come when the main characters get to speak plainly and passionately.	A glimpse at the private romance of a fascist leader	A sustained, alternatingly exhausting and aesthetically exhilarating howl of a film.	Part political treatise, part melodrama, Marco Bellocchio's Mussolini biopic forsakes historical details in favor of absorbing emotion -- and provides a showcase for a stunning performance from Giovanna Mezzogiorno.
Scott has updated the setting, but, more significantly, he's refashioned things in tone, style and theme, deftly recasting it to fit the standard template of the contemporary Hollywood action film.	This is a post-9/11 city: terrorism is suspected, the cops are over-armed and trigger happy. Why they don't shoot Ryder when they could is unexplained.	Solid performances can't lift this picture above its own mediocrity, however. The plot is formulaic ... and the ending obvious.	(Director Tony) Scott ... uses the camera like a little boy shouting, "Look at me, look at me," instead of simply telling the story.	Like most of Scott's recent films, this one ends in self-indulgent silliness. You end up asking yourself, how do the few fun bits of the film manage to survive in the midst of so much lousy filmmaking?	Despite a strong cast, The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 suffers under the excesses of Tony Scott's frantic direction, and fails to measure up to the 1974 original.
A man who discovers the beauty of a woman his own age? Only Hollywood - birthplace of the Trophy Wife - could try to pass this notion off as something clever and original.	But really, seriously, what woman wouldn't want to be Keaton, all sexy, funny, tender, quick, and never more charismatic in her animated access to her own feelings? And what man, of any age, wouldn't want to be with her?	Ms. Keaton projects her wondrously warm personality, and the erstwhile Jake Gittes keeps us entertained with a sense of irony that keeps things from getting too sticky.	We're not only watching Diane Keaton's character regaining her sexuality. We're watching Diane Keaton regaining her status as one of Hollywood's most winsome leading ladies.	A surprisingly good comedy that managed to exceed expectations basically because of the strong performances of Nicholson and Keaton.	Though it occasionally stumbles into sitcom territory, Something's Gotta Give is mostly a smart, funny romantic comedy, with sharp performances from Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, and Keanu Reeves.
The film's long final phase is a harrowing series of sublime images of death and those about to die.	Revisiting Titanic on the big screen, this time in impressive 3D, is a welcome reminder of solid blockbuster movie magic.	Time skips by quickly, and there are more than a few decent supporting performances to enjoy.	Titanic is a great, soft-hearted traditional epic.	Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.	A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.
"Begin Again" feels more like a glorified retread of "Once" than something freshly imagined.	This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.	Knightley brings emotional confusion into sharp, touching focus as the pair bond over nighttime strolls and the shared love of classic pop. Carney flips film clichés to keep us guessing.	Carney's latest isn't quite the equal of Once, but who could have twice bottled that lightning?	The film's original title was the not-entirely-rhetorical question Can A Song Save Your Life? Carney makes it clear that in his opinion, yes, it can.	Writer-director John Carney's return to musical drama isn't quite as potent as it was with Once, but thanks to charming work from its well-matched leads, Begin Again is difficult to resist.
If the purpose of the Up series has been to show how class determines destiny in the UK, then what we've actually learned is that everyone there gets a fair shot to make it to the middle.	... easily the best series ever made. 49 UP is an emotionally rewarding experience that is akin to vicariously living a dozen lives in just over two short hours.	This seventh installment is utterly fascinating, drawing heavily on footage from the previous movies to follow each child on the journey into middle age.	When I saw 42 Up in 1999, I thought the series had run its natural course and that it was time to leave the "kids" alone. I was wrong. They have just entered a new and exciting phase of lives that are very much works in progress.	Whether we actually 'know' these individuals or not is beside the point; we feel we do, and this enriches the experience of watching the most ambitious documentary project ever committed to celluloid.	The latest installment in this remarkable series, 49 Up is a satisfying continuation of Michael Apted's singular sociological and cinematic experiment.
The script has an annoying tendency to alternate between snappy one liners and tedious sex based ROLFs.	It makes very good use of its supporting cast.	If you like looking at Natalie Portman, you may take a fancy to the movie. Otherwise, you might find it a bore.	A romantic comedy that looks smutty but is actually slushy.	Problems range from howlingly obvious flaws like the foul, Knocked Up-wannabe script, to almost undetectable nuisances like the way Kutcher never signals when he's turning into a side street or driveway.	It benefits from the presence of Natalie Portman and director Ivan Reitman's steady hand, but No Strings Attached doesn't have the courage or conviction to follow through on its ribald premise.
The actors are uniformly good, including Broadbent's unctuous Buckingham and Hawthorne's sweet, unsuspecting Clarence.	In a shamelessly entertaining display of acting brilliance, McKellen 'plays' the demon's good arm as if it were a Stradivarius, executing one showy stunt after another.	While this curious clash between a near-modern setting and the much older source material might seem confounding, it actually serves to energize the play, as well as making it more palatable to present-day audiences.	A great concept-- and McKellen still rules Shakes works!	Striking, fun and, finally, disturbing.	This re-imagining of Shakespeare's Crookback King relocates the story in 1930 and features an indelible star turn for Ian McKellen as the monstrous and magnetic King Richard.
The film's long middle is still a slog, but the beginning and ending are loud and weird enough to supply solid entertainment.	This fifth and mercifully final installment features so much idle anticipation that it's unclear whether we're watching a movie or an Apple product launch.	I'm not sure why I even bother to review these movies. TWILIGHT fans are going to see these regardless of what I think. They're going to like BREAKING DAWN part 2, just because it's TWILIGHT. They're blinded.	It's not a terribly satisfactory capper to the Twilight franchise because it sets aside the strange undercurrents of desire and danger that defined the series and made it such a hair-tearing conundrum for feminists ...	It is over. You say nothing is over until we say it is over? The long national nightmare ends not with a bang or a thud but with one of the biggest FUs in Cinematic history	It's the most entertaining Twilight, but that's not enough to make Breaking Dawn Part 2 worth watching for filmgoers who don't already count themselves among the franchise converts.
The characters are two-dimensional parodies, trapped in a movie that doesn't know how to do parody. It's a good idea for a short, dragged out into a feature-length film.	It runs out of steam after about 20 minutes and that's with 10 minutes' grace because the girls are so fetching in a Britney Spears "Hit Me Baby" sort of way.	...semi-entertaining...	Pretty disarming overall, and has a nicely satiric edge to it.	Breezy and silly and laugh-out-loud funny, full of throw-away lines and absurd humour.	Lacking enough material for a full-length movie, D.E.B.S. is short on both plot and laughs.
The most inventive vampire picture of the last 80 years.	Far from gimmicky, it's as personal and unreserved as filmmaking gets.	Maddin takes cinema to its outer limits without stranding you there in a vacuum of heady esoterica.	As lifeless as a Masterpiece Theatre broadcast, broken up by pirouettes and pliés instead of Alistair Cooke's droning.	Marries B&W silent horror-movie style with beautifully eerie ballet in a succulently cinematic, lustfully melodramatic adaptation that is at once wholly unique and uncommonly faithful to Bram Stoker's classic novel.	Guy Maddin's film is a richly sensuous and dreamy interpretation of Dracula that reinvigorates the genre.
The humor in Orange County is not just tasteless but consistently off a note or two.	There really isn't much to Orange County -- even though it's only 81 minutes long, it feels unduly padded.	Orange County provides proof that the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree.	This is a movie for every single high school senior in America who has just completed or is right now going through the process of applying to college.	The essential problem in Orange County is that, having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast, the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do.	Smarter than the average teen movie, but a little on the unmemorable side.
The last action hero was the one before Diesel.	If the Terminator went back in time to win a game of Dungeons and Dragons, it'd be a lot like The Chronicles of Riddick.	All the stunning visuals in the world can't raise Chronicles above the level of a ridiculous Rambo-in-space flick.	A grandiose, inflated, FX sledgehammer.	Just because you want to create a universe doesn't mean you'll be able to present it well, and The Chronicles of Riddick is a case in point.	As an action movie, Riddick offers some thrills, but as a sequel to Pitch Black, it's a disappointment.
What's real and true about Winter Passing is the relationship between Don and Reese, the father and daughter who wear their damaged dynamic on their sleeves for all to see.	The best part of Winter Passing -- is the way its random characters connect, like snowflakes bouncing off each other, like words suddenly taking shape on a page.	[Rapp] brings out in Deschanel a sense of yearning, an avidity, that hits home. It's her most emotionally layered performance.	Underneath the contemplative tone and poetic visuals lies a disappointingly familiar coming-of-age story.	Family drama appears content to present the situation without going for anything remotely close to the emotional jugular.	This dour coming-of-age story has nothing to distinguish it from similarly themed indie fare.
This prequel to a sequel to a remake is a fitfully entertaining affair, one that will enthrall its target audience...and their parents too.	Buy some popcorn, check your brain at the door and have fun.	The Rock's version of Conan the Barbarian -- a clunky, primitive platform for a star who has yet to get in full touch with his inner Terminator.	There are quite a few slow spots, never more so than when we're asked to believe in The Rock and Kelly Hu falling in love.	I smell what The Rock is cooking. It's junk food: there's no nutritional value whatsoever and it doesn't fill you up, but it sure is fun to eat.	Action adventure doesn't get much cheesier than The Scorpion King.
Forget the end and there is much to enjoy here, especially in the playing of Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush.	Neither thrilling nor particularly funny.	Brosnan is great as the nasty, manipulative spy, using his wits, charm and sex appeal to outmaneuver everyone around him.	If the film's emotions are not always in balance, its clumsiness is also part of the fun.	[Boorman] manages to strike exactly the right tone, which is somewhere between irony and amused incredulity.	The Tailor of Panama is a smart, darkly satirical thriller with exuberant performances from Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush.
Though not a completely successful film, A Thousand Acres is hard-hitting, original, and brimming with unwavering moral convictions and the courage to follow them to their troubling conclusions.	When they're done like this, touchy-feely dramas are no improvement on Hollywood's usual testosterone-laced fare.	Cry, cry, cry. Hug, hug, hug. Yadda, yadda, yadda.	Enter A Thousand Acres at your own risk.	Although the plot is undeniably overwrought at times, the characters remain strong and reliable, and it's their believability that pulls us through.	A Thousand Acres makes disappointingly sudsy stuff out of the source material, but benefits from solid performances by a strong cast.
On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, this original version is having its first U.S. release, and fans will find it, if not quite the masterpiece some Japanese critics have proclaimed, at least a saner, more poetic film.	There's a surprisingly powerful thrust to this film.	A masterpiece: even in its most generic elements, it's never just a monster movie, but a fantastic depiction of how humans survive and struggle.	The special effects for this re-released 1954 film by Ishiro Honda may now look a bit creaky, but the storytelling is muscular and the post-nuclear parable it offers is passionate and fascinatingly ambiguous.	While the Raymond Burr version is unintentionally funny, the original Japanese-language version is actually a tedious bore. But the Big G is still the king!	More than straight monster-movie fare, Gojira offers potent, sobering postwar commentary.
Even though director Peter Kassovitz tries hard to reproduce the soul-chilling despair of the ghetto, truth eludes Jakob The Liar.	Jakob the Liar is so forced that only the interest of a star of Williams' magnitude could have gotten it made.	If telling lies can save a people, he reasons, let the stories - and those fictional tanks - roll.	Seems forced, calculating, self-conscious.	As noble an effort this is, released a week after Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, it will only receive second-class accommodations from the movie-going public.	Any real story is buried by awkward performances and contrived situations.
If Mostly Martha is mostly unsurprising, it's still a sweet, even delectable diversion.	Good, solid storytelling.	It's well-acted, its humor is well-placed and even its more sentimental scenes aren't as sickeningly goopy as they surely would have been if the film had come from a major studio.	Other than the abrupt, rushed ending, the rest of the movie is meticulously crafted.	The plot unfolds exactly as you expect, but Gedeck imbues Martha with a remarkably subtlety of spirit.	Mostly Martha may have a predictable plot, but it still feels charming and fresh, and the food will make you hungry.
They emerged with a film that is supposed to be an art documentary, but is really a kind of immersive fever dream and time machine.	If you're interested in the history of the human race -- if you're a member of the human race -- you owe it to yourself to see this movie.	It's impossible to overstate the beauty of the Chauvet paintings: horses, rhinos, bison, and many other species flow around the curved walls of the caves...	Too often, you feel the weight of a serious subject slackening the normally adroit Herzog.	Herzog's greatest gift with the film is allowing us to be left to be alone with our own thoughts and emotions on these sights.	Hauntingly filmed and brimming with Herzog's infectious enthusiasm, Cave of Forgotten Dreams is a fascinating triumph.
This is a beautiful film	For all his command of ambitious and playful narrative ingenuity and apt technical flair, Berger's study in demonised female vanity and the power of true beauty favours atmosphere over frenzy - and achieves it in striking fashion.	This exquisite Spanish take on the Snow White fairy tale is in a different league from Hollywood's two recent attempts to retell the story: it's clever, artistic and emotionally thrilling	Will amuse and delight anyone who enjoys the Snow White story but always felt it needed more bullfighting. Happily, it will amuse and delight almost everyone else into the bargain.	Blancanieves is a beautifully crafted, if not entirely successful throwback to a golden age of filmmaking from nearly a century ago, a lovely excursion back to a previous era.	Smartly written and beautiful to behold, Blancanieves uses its classic source material to offer a dark tale, delightfully told.
Palliative Care: The Movie. Now that's entertainment.	The Debt has one of the worst endings to an otherwise well-crafted thriller in recent memory.	It's best just to go and see what happens.	A spy thriller with all the action and double the deceit.	A taut, suspenseful ride through the doldrums of the late summer movie dead season.	Its time-shifting narrative creates distracting casting problems, but ultimately, The Debt is a smart, well-acted entry in a genre that could use more like it.
It left me crying like a five year old...	It dips a little too deeply into unnecessary sentimentality and ends on a gimmicky note, but all of its faults don't detract from a whole that's deeply concerned with its characters.	Seldom does a studio release feature so little drama -- and not much comedy either, other than when the dog clowns around.	Utterly delightful, fact-based story of how a loving but unruly yellow Labrador brings joy and occasional tsuris to a young Florida couple and their offspring makes for perfect holiday entertainment. Families, dog lovers and even demanding breeds of filmg	It has some funny moments, a lot of tears and way too much dead time in between.	Pet owners should love it, but Marley and Me is only sporadically successful in wringing drama and laughs from its scenario.
With a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film, Lovely & Amazing involves us because it is so incisive, so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives.	A chick flick of a particularly intelligent, ruthless, and loving sort.	A tasty little trifle for viewers who enjoy a hefty slice of life topped with fascinating characters.	One of the funniest and most endearing films of the year . . . it is difficult in an appearance-obsessed culture to go against the grain and find beauty within.	Performances are potent, and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving.	The bitingly truthful Lovely & Amazing is a smart and perceptive female character study.
Condon deserves credit for shaking up the usual biopic formula, modeling his narrative structure after Kinsey's famous sex interviews with the scientist himself (Liam Neeson) answering questions about his own sexual history.	Another sanitized bio of a flawed man.	A smooth, elegant docudrama...well-groomed, handsomely mounted and adroitly laid out,...but ultimately--like its subject--a trifle schoolmasterish.	.....an enlightening portrayal of the controversial and passionate Dr. Alfred Kinsey.	Beautifully directed from a very clever script, this film courts controversy as it echoes Kinsey's own refusal to moralise.	A biopic of the sex researcher is hailed as adventurous, clever, and subversive, with fine performances by Liam Neeson and Laura Linney.
It's clear that Neveldine and Taylor could have come up with something deeper, darker, and better for their third act. Instead, they lean on the easy cheat codes of conventionality, somehow forgetting they're better at exploding them.	In the space of ninety minutes, we get a body count that has to be in the triple digits, loads of T & A, and even a full on musical number	There's plenty of violence, but the movie's already-passe fear of a Web-based world is standard-issue.	While it's a decent and sometimes effective thriller, the guys have done better -- a lot better	It should be ridiculously easy to have fun with a concept like this, but the joyless, coarse, bordering-on-hostile way this whole thing is put together just smacks of contempt for not only the audience, but storytelling in general.	With all of the hyperkinetic action and none of the flair of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's earlier work, Gamer has little replay value.
These sheep defy the stereotype. They are fiercely individual and resourceful. It's the humans who look like conformists.	Funny, witty and delightful. Kids will love it!	"Shaun the Sheep Movie" delivers exactly what it promises: The cutest, most innocuous entertainment this side of Internet panda videos.	Only Aardman could find an irresistible movie in industrial amounts of clay and a story of an amnesiac farmer and his flock at loose in the big city.	Benign, animal-based hi-jinks, frantic chases along country lanes, a constant soundtrack of squeaks, grunts and snorts, beautifully rendered stop-motion, all drenched in a haze of geniality and glee.	Warm, funny, and brilliantly animated, Shaun the Sheep is yet another stop-motion jewel in Aardman's family-friendly crown.
Remember when you looked forward to seeing a new Oliver Stone film?	This long, strange trip is fun but aimless.	Bizarre, somewhat baffling, but nonetheless intriguing and warped entertainment for anyone brave enough to tackle it.	Perplexing in the extreme.	If you want to see U TURN precisely for Stone's individual stamp on the work, you probably won't be disappointed	U-Turn is a lurid, stylish lark that boasts striking moments but lacks the focus and weight of Oliver Stone best work.
Entertaining despite nearly fatal plot holes.	An ingenuous knot of plot, expertly tangled, in which nothing is quite what it seems.	Stylist Claude Lelouche (A Man and a Woman) is still full of surprises in his choice of genres and subjects.	Though Lelouch has toned down his penchant for putting pretty pictures ahead of plot, there's still a nagging sense of disposability.	As fizzy and non-nutritive as a glass of sparkling wine, Roman de Gare is a crowd-pleasing blend of romance, farce and mystery that plays out a little like a Ruth Rendell mystery novel with Rendell herself as the chief suspect.	Claude Lelouch has crafted an engaging thriller about murder and romance with plenty of stylistic panache.
Chases and choreographed fights set to rock music take up most of the running time and the movie is like To Catch a Thief remade by a hack follower of John Woo.	While it certainly has more gunplay and kung-fu hijinks ... it is ultimately less entertaining, despite the likeable leads.	This is cool, slick stuff, ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters.	Please, not another boring action movie. Alas...too late.	The film's biggest asset, surprisingly enough, is Jason Statham, who shows terrific potential as an action hero, and could easily match wits with actors like Vin Diesel or Jean Claude Van Damme.	The Transporter delivers the action at the expense of coherent storytelling.
Pitch Perfect looks, sounds, and feels like pretty much every other movie that features a singing or dancing competition.	It moves at a clip, a sprightly relay race between a dozen or so mellifluous performers.	The quality of the material may not be the highest, but the energy and execution of it certainly is in this appealingly sprightly investigation of the world of a capella.	Oh, the gag-packed trailer spoiled the entire film.	Recycled as it is from the spare parts of fun fluff like "Bring it On," Pitch Perfect understands its own fizzy pop irrelevance, and wisely puts the emphasis on getting laughs.	Pitch Perfect's plot is formulaic, but the performances are excellent and the musical numbers are toe-tapping as well.
I will not defend it as a good movie, but I have to say, I had a pretty good time at it.	A throwback picture that returns you to the late '90s, when every third filmmaker thought he was the next Quentin Tarantino.	This sequel is a bit more comedic, a bit more convoluted and a bit more everything than its predecessor, which is a heady thing for eager fans of the stillborn cult flick, and fairly irrelevant to just about everyone else.	[Norman] Reedus pretty much captures the entire film with his signature line: "Let's do some gratuitous violence."	Let's just say it doesn't make me feel like Riverdancing.	This sequel to the cult favorite The Boondock Saints is more of the same -- unoriginal, absurd, violent, over-the-top, and occasionally mean-spirited.
Observe and Report is the evil twin of Paul Blart, which had a soft heart but no nerve. This flick is almost criminally cynical, but delinquents will think there's something arresting about a movie whose mission is disturbing the peace.	Not for all tastes, but a true groundbreaker.	Here's the simplest way to put it: if you liked the over-the-top, brutal finale of Pineapple Express, you'll most likely find yourself enjoying Observe and Report...	Mindless, silly and outrageously funny with hilarious, lively comedic performances and plenty of bold, inane and mean-spirited humor.	One of the ballsier comedies to come from a big studio in some time that's likely going to tear at audience's expectations but, hopefully, will have them appreciating its creators.	Though it has a mean streak, and does not cater to all tastes, Observe and Report has gut-busting laughs and a fully committed Seth Rogen in irresistible form.
Be amazed at my cruel virility. Feel the pain. Oh yeah.	Ultimately, we feel like the hero, hypnotized but desensitized and utterly turned off by its histrionic horrors.	A dark and psychologically discomfiting drama of abstract action and horror.	A movie that can leave you lost, repulsed, fascinated and ultimately chastened.	A visually beguiling trip that keeps pulling you along and keeps you wondering what fresh hell could possibly come next.	Violent and definitely not for the squeamish, Park Chan-Wook's visceral Oldboy is a strange, powerful tale of revenge.
Mediocre from foundation to roof, this sequel to 2005's tepid road trip farce Are We There Yet? is the movie equivalent of a tear-down.	The real question is whether or not Ice Cube's career is done yet.	The problem with the new film is that Ice Cube is too cool for the plot's nonsense. The faulty house and McGinley's behavior never inspire him to blow his top.	US audiences ate it up and there are just enough laughs to appease those whose tastes run to utterly undemanding kiddie slapstick and life lessons.	Don't expect classic screwball charm from this by-the-numbers family gagfest.	Are We Done Yet? plays it way too safe with generic slapstick and uninspired domestic foibles.
Perfection never enters into director Mark Rosman's insipid comedy drama.	A tweener romantic comedy featuring dialogue so bad it could have been written by a 14-year-old girl.	The intrigues are laboriously contrived, the film exudes disingenuous sentiments, and it has three happy endings -- one for Mum and one for each daughter.	Arrives at some thoughtful conclusions that are likely to strike chords with mothers and daughters.	[The] situation is mined mostly for mild chuckles and tepid sentiment.	Preposterous and predictable, The Perfect Man manages few laughs with its poorly paced sitcom script, cookie-cutter characters and contrived plotting.
Frothy wedding romcom is fun but unimaginative.	[A] traditionally contrived but still rather charming rom-com.	Calling 27 Dresses predictable is putting it mildly. From the opening scene, it's painfully obvious exactly where the film is going and how everything is going to turn out.	All the plot elements that we're encouraged to care about in 27 Dresses resolve in a dud, and the only thing that feels good about the feel-good finish is that it means the movie's over.	Certainly Heigl fares better in less formulaic fare, such as Judd Apatow's irreverent Knocked Up, but she does raise the level of this chick flick from bland to mildly entertaining.	The filmmakers perfectly follow the well-worn romantic comedy formula, rendering 27 Dresses clichéd and mostly forgettable.
Whether you like rap music or loathe it, you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie.	Broomfield's film ends up being much less interested in Biggie and Tupac per se than in the simultaneously extraordinary and mundane circumstances surrounding their deaths, in particular, the go-nowhere investigations.	Biggie and Tupac is so single-mindedly daring, it puts far more polished documentaries to shame.	It's like a rap Rashomon. There's a million different stories here.	Journalistically dubious, inept and often lethally dull.	This is a compelling documentary, even for those who aren't fans of rap.
Well-made, but those who aren't ready to zen out in Surf City can find documentaries that are just as worthwhile on The History Channel or Animal Planet.	From the film's opening seconds, in which a lone surfer emerges from a wave's whitewater to the strains of first organ, then choir music, we can see that the filmmaker has come to sanctify his subject rather than explore it.	An aficionada of the saltwater documentary, I am thrilled to report that Riding Giants, Stacy Peralta's exhilarating account of the revolution and evolution in big-wave surfing, is among the best of this breathtaking genre.	Awe-inspiring documentary about the history of big-wave surfing.	It's The Alchemist for surfers. It's Winged Migration for beach bums. It's Rudy in the water. It's a must-see.	A great addition to the existing surfing documentaries.
Let us not contemplate the sorts of lustful images that must run through the mind of a hormonal teen-age turtle.	Maintains an effective balance between the kiddie toon and the more subtle comics it was based on. Koteas is miscast, though.	There is no excuse	Scores with its generally engaging tongue-in-cheek humor.	Who would have expected a great martial arts movie from guys wearing turtle costumes?	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is exactly as advertised: one-liners, brawls, and general silliness. Good for the young at heart, irritating for everyone else.
Shocking, credible and hard to forget.	Like the majestic camera movement with which it opens, Wake In Fright is a film that travels in slow, inexorable circles, presenting its paranoid nightmare of entrapment as Kafka down under.	Several decades later, it still chills.	There is queasy undercurrent of sentimental kindness and indulgence beneath the violence.	A riveting film with exceptional relevance today in its cultural veracity and its observation of not just outback Australian society (if you can call it that), but in human nature.	A disquieting classic of Australian cinema, Wake in Fright surveys a landscape both sun-drenched and ruthlessly dark.
The slick ambience behind Fracture could be penetrating yet misleading. Hopkins's "Lecter-lite" persona adds some pathos to this old-fashioned yet stylistic whodunit.	This hugely entertaining thriller is what's needed to banish a winter-long case of movie blues.	This legal thriller pits these two brilliant actors against one another in a sustained battle of wills that has enough sizzle to keep us rapt even when the storyline sags and zags.	Awesome drama... a battle of charisma between Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.	It's smart, it will keep you guessing, and it plays fair.	Though Fracture's plot is somewhat implausible, the onscreen face-off between Gosling and Hopkins overshadows any faults.
It is challenging but simultaneously exhilarating as we travel through this never-waking nightmare.	Suffice to say that three hours of hallucinatory audacity passes a lot faster than you might expect.	An amazing and unshakeable experience.	this story of magic, madness and metempsychosis will have you feeling like a rabbit trying to puzzle out what exactly is going on as wilder wolves circle and headlights career toward you out of the darkness.	While it is not nearly as good as Mulholland Drive, this latest complex concoction is fascinating in parts; even if you don't understand it	Typical David Lynch fare: fans of the director will find Inland Empire seductive and deep. All others will consider the heady surrealism impenetrable and pointless.
It requires and solicits a certain generosity of spirit and an openness to experience, but what it offers in return is something remarkable.	This portrait of an aging couple is a deeply rewarding, heartbreaking, utterly worthy successor to two films which inspired it: Ozu's Tokyo Story and Leo McCarey's great, forgotten 1937 Make Way for Tomorrow.	This is a sweet-natured piece, and though the final section in Tokyo itself is sentimental and over-extended, there are poignant, mordant insights.	Sometimes a quiet whisper is more compelling than the loudest shout. Cherry Blossoms is a gentle, maudlin tale of love, loss, family ties and the fleeting nature of life.	As Cherry Blossoms (Kirschblüten - Hanami) begins, Trudi is surprised when she learns her husband is dying of an unnamed condition.	This mature and eloquent meditation on grief and loss sports measured performances and moments of humor.
The two leads of Midnight Run are clever and funny men.	As with all the best road movies -- and this is one of the best -- the picture really moves, as a simple air trip from New York to LA turns into a saga of trains and automobiles, car crashes, and skirmishes with the FBI and [other] interested parties.	Fun buddy picture. Not great on repeated viewings, but the first time was great	A thoroughly engaging action film, Midnight Run boasts a superb cast that transforms its rather mundane story line into something memorable, funny, and moving.	The chemistry is the thing in this buddy movie from the director of "Beverly Hills Cop."	Enlivened by the antagonistic chemistry between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin, Midnight Run is an uncommonly entertaining odd couple comedy.
The zippy, brutal action sequences are gripping, the violence sometimes shocking.	In the old days, a feverish programmer like 28 Days Later would end up on the bottom half of a double bill.	An edge-of-your-seat scary movie that startles and chills.	Relentlessly grim and gruesome, it does what it sets out to do; the problem is that apparently what it wants isn't so much to give us a pleasant scare as to disgust us.	A tough, smart, ingenious movie that leads its characters into situations where everything depends on their (and our) understanding of human nature.	Kinetically directed by Danny Boyle, 28 Days Later is both a terrifying zombie movie and a sharp political allegory.
With Scary Movie 4, [director] Zucker creates a virtual duplicate of the last film, replete with a Michael Jackson impersonator. Once again, the gags grow repetitive, and all the highlights have been featured in the preview trailer.	There's only so much humor left to wring from the pup tent of Brokeback Mountain or the matted-hair fetish of the Japanese horror genre.	The humor is supposed to come from the recognition that another movie or entertainment world incident from the pages of Us Weekly is having fun poked at it.	There's possibly nothing sadder in the world of cinema than a comedy trying this hard for laughs.	Has the fourth of any film series ever worked? This does! It's a franchise that could keep on scaring up the spoofs and mixed metaphors till the cows come home to roost.	Sure to inspire a few chuckles, but not enough to compensate for the recycled material from its predecessors.
Given that 88 Minutes actually runs 108 minutes, it's tempting to make the joke that the movie is 20 minutes too long. In actuality, it's 108 minutes too long.	I should have walked out after 8 minutes.	It takes eight minutes, tops, to know that even by the conventionally lax standards of watch-and-toss serial-killer movies, 88 Minutes is a stinker, the more so for the thespian excesses of the accomplished cast.	'88 Minutes' is a muddled, low-quality thriller.	This movie is Battlefield Earth bad. It's 10,000 B.C. bad. It's bad with a side of fries and a cherry cola.	88 Minutes is a shockingly inept psychological thriller that expertly squanders the talent at hand.
A powerful and poignant drama about Lourdes, miracles, faith, grace, and the mysteries surrounding cures that go beyond reason and explanation.	Beautifully led by birdlike Sylvie Testud as an ailing young woman in a wheelchair, every character (pilgrim and helper alike) exhibits a soul. And shaped with confident talent by the Austrian filmmaker, every serenely composed shot matters.	Lourdes starts from the unexpected position of believing miracles are possible, but it doesn't paper over the religious and practical problems they raise -- for the blessed and bereft alike.	Hausner subtly sketches in the characters involved -- the pilgrims, the carers, the bemused but conscientious resident priest -- and the tensions and jealousies that thrive in Lourdes' hothouse atmosphere, without ever showing her hand.	A cucumber-cool satire which views the poetry and passion of spiritual faith through a prism of rigid bureaucracy and ruthless logic.	As bewitchingly ambiguous as it is beautifully shot, Lourdes explores profound themes with subtlety and a deft comic touch -- and a marvelous performance from its star, Sylvie Testud.
Parents beware; this is downright movie penance.	The fourth in a series that I'll bet most parents had thought --hoped! -- was a fad that had long since vanished.	Supposedly, Pokemon can't be killed, but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over.	Rarely has a film's title served such dire warning.	The fourth "Pokemon" is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee, with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance.	Only for diehard Pokemon fans.
The film is beautiful to look at and fascinating to talk about, but the story is a bit stuck too much in the 1930s to really engage a modern audience.	A technological marvel whose gimmickry outlives its welcome.	A beguilingly unreal excursion into the imaginative world of another age must viewing for golden-age Hollywood buffs impresses without becoming truly engaging.	Though this movie will pave the way technologically, hopefully, the next movie that uses CGI this extensively will also have a gripping story to go along with it.	The design loses its novelty very quickly, and, with no human factor to ground them, the graphics simply can't carry the movie.	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is slim on plot and characterization, but the visuals more than make up for it.
The most audacious pop-cultural amalgam since Star Wars.	Lacking the sophistication of the average comic book, it compensates with panoramic attack sequences, reminiscent of the Japanese swarm attacks in American war movies.	Terrific entertainment.	As written by Ed Neumeier, who also wrote Verhoeven's much tighter Robocop, Starship Troopers never gets over its 180-degree swivel from teen-age love story to murderous destruction.	Director Paul Verhoeven is back in his subversively nimble RoboCop groove with the uproariously cheeky Starship Troopers.	A fun movie...if you can accept the excessive gore and wooden acting.
A satirical, bloody road trip comedy in the heart of Mike Leigh country.	Deftly directed by Ben Wheatley (whose fright-fest Kill List is a must on DVD)...the film is careful not to make light of violence, using comedy to sharpen its sinister edge	[A]s relentlessly vicious as Kill List, [but] goes so insanely in the other direction when it comes to comedy -- and when it comes to a self-awareness of the dark humor often inherent in tales of brutal bloody murder...	It's funny and dark, but it's also unconventionally insightful and full of heart - or at least the hearts that are left beating.	Daft and darkly hilarious, but bleak? Oh yes. Almost too bleak.	Director Ben Wheatley and writer-stars Alice Lowe and Steve Oram deliver a wicked road trip movie that successfully walks the line between dark comedy and horror.
Lazy, perfunctory and free of tension, the new version will satisfy neither the admirers of the original nor anyone looking for a gory respite from seasonal good cheer.	this reimagining showcases with encyclopaedic relish just about every slasher convention and variation that has evolved over the last thirty or so years since the original Black Christmas screened.	One for real horror-buffs only.	A surprisingly memorable creepfest that fleshes out the characters' backstories while adding a heaping helping of blacker-than-pitch humor to the proceedings.	Even by the notoriously low standards of sadistic slasher pics, this remake is a thoroughly nasty piece of work, relying heavily on such gruesome spectacles as the baking (and consuming) of Christmas cookies made from chunks of human flesh.	A gratuitous remake of the 1974 slasher, Black Christmas pumps out the gore and blood with zero creativity, humor, or visual flair.
To many, this is the best love story ever, if not the greatest film of all times.	Even hardened cynics who might be impelled to dismiss it as a collection of button-pushing clichés will most likely get swept up in the all the unabashed romance.	Part of what makes this wartime Hollywood drama (1942) about love and political commitment so fondly remembered is its evocation of a time when the sentiment of this country about certain things appeared to be unified.	The casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration.	Every kid should see this Bogart classic.	An undisputed masterpiece and perhaps Hollywood's quintessential statement on love and romance, Casablanca has only improved with age, boasting career-defining performances from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
A mediocre, unimaginative, inefficient filmmaker, Columbus delivers a Rent that isn't so much bad as perfunctory.	Director Chris Columbus has done what any smart filmmaker would do with a musical and let the songs dictate his movie.	Heart is the core and foundation of Rent, and it is what powers the film past its flaws into a truly transformative experience.	[Afield] from its off-Broadway origins, but the intimacy afforded by the camera and...most of the original cast occasionally restore the emotional vitality of the piece.	Columbus has made his finest, most emotionally rich film yet.	Fans of the stage musical may forgive Rent its flaws, but weak direction, inescapable staginess and an irritating faux-boho pretension prevent the film from connecting on screen.
The movie is a victory lap for American journalism -- the triumphant flip side to Network's self-loathing take on the media.	A classic and factual American detective tale in need of remake now that Deep Throat is known. Maybe Adam Sandler could star?	The opening of the film, with Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) first stumbling over the story, is involving and sometimes exciting, but from then on it degenerates into confusion and repetition.	A finer political film you will not find. It should be declared a national treasure.	gripping and important	A taut, solidly acted paean to the benefits of a free press and the dangers of unchecked power, made all the more effective by its origins in real-life events.
Further proof that Affleck -- after the professional doldrums of the Bennifer years -- is fulfilling the promise of Good Will Hunting and is a writer/director totally in command of his subject.	A worthy entry into the pantheon of great cops and robbers films, The Town is intelligent, darkly funny and full of harrowing, high-impact thrills. A breath of life into B. Affleck's career and proof of J. Renner's stardom.	Doesn't match Affleck's first film, 'Gone Baby Gone,' in emotional depth or impact. But as an old-school movie about an old-school culture, it's pretty good.	Everyone in The Town shines, even Blake Lively, but it's Chris Cooper as MacRay's imprisoned dad who astounds.	Smart, sleek and undeniably entertaining, Ben Affleck's sophomore directorial effort proves he's the real deal.	Tense, smartly written, and wonderfully cast, The Town proves that Ben Affleck has rediscovered his muse -- and that he's a director to be reckoned with.
With a perfectly cast Antonio Banderas slashing those Zs, The Mask of Zorro offers as many zesty sword fights as an Errol Flynn film festival.	It's not the movie of the decade, year or even summer, but Zorro has enough going for it to keep you amused and into the story.	It's what Hollywood action films used to be: fun and entertaining instead of explosion-riddled and mindless.	Hopkins brings gravity and dignity to every role he assumes, which is exactly what is needed here to offset the rambunctious impatience of Banderas' Alejandro.	God knows it's hokum of the purest stripe, but Campbell, Hopkins, Banderas, and especially the alarmingly vivacious Zeta-Jones pull it off in spades.	Banderas returns as an aging Zorro in this surprisingly nimble, entertaining swashbuckler.
The documentary makes fascinating connections between the fledgling high-showbiz days of rock 'n' roll and the rise of more versatile singer-songwriters in the 1970s.	... an enjoyable labor of love	The story of studio rock's secret weapon...	The Wrecking Crew isn't about something falling apart, but a specific moment in time: a time that, as a viewer, you keep wanting to revisit.	This sing-along, joyful doc unearths a group of musicians who actually played all the music on the LPS by the Byrds, Cher, Nancy and Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, the Monkees, and Captain and Tennille. A must to see and listen to.	The Wrecking Crew may not achieve the greatness of the many classic songs its subjects helped bring to life, but it remains a heartfelt, overdue tribute to overshadowed brilliance.
When I caught this modern-day screwball comedy in theaters I didn't think much of it, and it's even less appealing now.	If Russell is erratic with plot and the slightest bit smug in attitude, he makes up for these flaws by drawing fun, inspired performances from his ace cast.	Um elenco afiado, personagens atьpicos e situaушes bizarras contribuem para tornar este filme uma comжdia surpreendentemente eficaz.	Not exactly bad. Actually, an okay way to spend 90 minutes of your life.	Russell's anarchic comedy comes up with some doozy ideas, and some of the comedy is clever and on the mark.	Darkly funny, solidly cast, and surprisingly thoughtful, Flirting with Disaster proved David O. Russell's Spanking the Monkey was no fluke.
The action scenes and color photography are generic.	A fast-moving, entertaining bit of silliness that's wrapped around a semi-interesting premise -- and a taut performance by Judd.	A lukewarm outing that mostly just bops from plot point to plot point.	Too bad you can't shoot the screenwriters.	A modest, moderately entertaining offshoot of a top-shelf hit.	A talented cast fails to save this unremarkable thriller.
Bardem's performance, a true triumph of face acting, imbues the character with simultaneous impish mischief and weary resignation.	For whatever reason, it's an injustice that Bardem was not nominated for best actor.	Director Alejandro Amenabar wisely presents the story simply, representing both opinions fairly.	Javier Bardem is the heart of this movie and he gives a great, screen-filling performance.	Bardem accomplishes something extraordinary. Eschewing easy sympathy, he creates a real person, real pain.	Held aloft by a transfixing performance from Javier Bardem as a terminally ill man who chooses to die, The Sea Inside transcends its melodramatic story with tenderness and grace.
You, Me & Dupree is best when Wilson is on-screen, mucking around with exquisite deadbeat timing, baring his all -- or his almost -- as the situation demands.	Sporadically enjoyable but instantly forgettable.	Given the intellectual level of this film and its lack of humor, it is not surprising that the ending rewards bad behavior. If you're smart, it's an ending you will never see.	Owen Wilson just does what he does, and allows you to take it or leave it. You, Me and Dupree, then, suffers a slow start and trades too frequently in broad, garish strokes before rallying with some late atypical turns.	You, Me and Dupree mostly sputters.	A rather generic entry into the arrested development subgenre, with themes borrowed from other more successful and funnier films. Dupree wears out its welcome.
If "The Lone Ranger" weighs itself down again and again, at least it finally delivers during a stunning third-act set-piece that at long last incorporates all of the elements that should have been readily up on the screen throughout.	I hate THE LONE RANGER as much as THE LONE RANGER hates The Lone Ranger.	Shot mostly across scenic landscapes in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, including Monument Valley, [it acts] as a visual tribute to some of the great Westerns of history shot by the likes of John Ford. This Lone Ranger won't be joining their ranks.	"The Lone Ranger" is a pounding headache of a movie - loud, dumb, overlong and pointless.	Frustrating, lazy and lifeless.	Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp make for an appealing pair of leads, but they're not enough to make up for The Lone Ranger's bland script, bloated length, and blaring action overkill.
It's poignant, quietly life-affirming little story that doesn't need to shout. Lonesome Jim's good company.	A slice of deadly dull life.	Casey Affleck is Jim, maybe the least starring role ever to center a movie. In this wet doughnut, he is the wide hole.	... the story of Percyesque ex-suicide, a parable about how embracing childish things can be part of growing up.	The 27-year-old protagonist of Steve Buscemi's deadpan comedy Lonesome Jim lives out the worst nightmare of every bushy-tailed go-getter who moves to New York to Be Somebody (in his case, a writer) and fails miserably.	Though Lonesome Jim is leavened by sweet, understated humor, it's hard to root for such a morose, self-defeating protagonist.
Directed by John Kerry's friend, George Butler, the film is clearly pro-Kerry, but it comes off as less a hagiography than a genuine history of the Vietnam War era.	Any open-minded person would have to agree that questions about his valor get settled here.	As seen in the new documentary Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry, our current Democratic Presidential nominee was once a true hero.	... beneath the hagiography is a deeply affecting portrait of a young man of privilege who didn't have to serve in Vietnam, yet in whom the idea of national service had been ingrained.	It's too bad that Kerry's likely to lose the upcoming election, because this type of hagiography would be far better in the unlikely event that Mr. "Wartime" President is going to be defeated.	Interesting and revealing footage of both Kerry and the Vietnam era in general.
The exhilaratingly fun, obliquely clever and feverishly crowd-pleasing achievement of director Sam Raimi spins a web that everyone wants to be caught up in.	Here's an unlimited-budget blockbuster that's engaged in its characters and its premise, one that cares about the implications of people's actions.	Not since The Empire Strikes Back or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, has a sequel been so darn satisfying... Films don't come any better.	Raimi has turned in a very different Spidey than might be expected. I'm not talking 'nipples on Batman' or anything; the shift is from origin story to mid-hero-crisis story.	It's the exposure of his precious face -- sign of his secret self -- that's most frightening, ordinary, and exciting.	Boasting an entertaining villain and deeper emotional focus, this is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original.
This film is a celebration of human achievement; it soars with the promise that we are shackled to the ground only by lack of imagination and will.	Director James Marsh's hypnotic movie documents French wire walker Philippe Petit's unauthorized, 45-minute balancing act 110 stories above New York in August 1974.	A feat like the one Philippe Petit pulled off deserves to be documented.	Fascinating documentary with an added white knuckle component.	Marsh's film may not probe very deeply into Petit's character, or try to conjecture what his accomplishment means in a post-9/11 environment, but it does make for a wonderful caper, which is exactly how Petit envisioned it.	James Marsh's doc about artist Phililppe Petit's artful caper brings you every ounce of suspense that can be wrung from a man on a (suspended) wire.
It's enough to make you think people really can talk to whales.	Like a breath of fresh South Pacific air, director Caro combines classic themes with a little-seen cultural perspective to come up with an uplifting crowd-pleaser.	It's spiritual, inspiring and features a child character of extraordinary grace and inner beauty.	An interesting, and often successful compromise in seeming to honor tradition, but at the same time delivering a politically-correct, liberal, tradition-breaking message.	The first 2/3rds are artfully, soulfully crafted with heart, family, tradition and real humor.	An empowering and uplifting movie, with a wonderful performance by Castle-Hughes.
The biggest drawback is that young stars Cox and Danes are insufferably colorless. Automatons could have given these performances.	As with most fairy tales, it can sound silly and overcomplicated because, really, it is silly and overcomplicated. That's part of the fun, part of its out-of-this-world power.	The comical, surprising De Niro turns Stardust into meteors of laughter.	They threw everything into this movie: a little swashbuckling adventure, a love story, acts of heroism and sacrifice, ghosts, witches, and never a dull moment. Enchanting.	Dazzling fantasy rom-com has some dark moments.	A faithful interpretation that captures the spirit of whimsy, action, and off-kilter humor of Neil Gaiman, Stardust juggles multiple genres and tones to create a fantastical experience.
Attenberg gets down in the emotional muck where life, death and sex intertwine. And like those life experiences, watching it can be both awkward and poignant.	Dogtooth and Attenberg are staunchly impenetrable works (closely resembling) art installations that don't resonate beyond a select few; if a film renaissance does emerge from Greece on the back of such films, will anyone notice?	Sex, death, and an absurdist style come together in Greek film	Fans of Dogtooth should certainly try this one out.	An early contender for film of the year.	At once playfully eccentric and poignantly bittersweet, Attenberg adds a refreshing sideways spin to the arthouse coming-of-age drama.
In his typically visceral way, McQueen rips the scab off a wound that may never fully heal and dares us to look away.	It's clear from the start that this movie isn't content to simply be viewed. The picture stares back.	Fortunately, 12 Years a Slave is not just a minor vanity project for Brad Pitt, who is one of its producers, but also a courageous step forward for director Steve McQueen.	One of the finest historical movies ever made.	But the much talked-about 12 Years a Slave is more than a beautifully shot art piece. It's history made violently real.	It's far from comfortable viewing, but 12 Years a Slave's unflinchingly brutal look at American slavery is also brilliant -- and quite possibly essential -- cinema.
Sounds like the kind of movie that might appeal to, I dunno, maybe all seven openly gay Mormons and not many others.	Even those who aren't immediately put off by the film's brazen attacks on religion -- and in particular, the LDS Church -- will likely be bored by this clumsy, incredibly contrived comedy, which has little charm.	A fairly flat, predictable tale.	Even if the film feels somewhat contrived, stick with it; you'll be rewarded by what it has to say.	Pilots its culture-challenging raison d'ętre through an increasingly insufferable collection of gaysploitation conventions.	A melodramatic plot and character stereotypes turn the movie into a sitcom.
Engineered to provide the same level of entertainment as a sugar rush, this frantic teen (pre-teen?) fantasy has the feel of something concocted in a lab specializing in energy drinks and peachy complexions.	Uncle Jesse and Joey must have been too busy to make appearances. Lucky them.	Separately the characters are annoying; together it's unnervingly like watching one actress playing twins.	The story is supposed to be about the twins' adventures in Manhattan. Mostly it's an excuse for the two to visit different neighborhoods and the script to drag in every stereotype the writers can think of.	A basic rip-off of "Ferris Bueller"...	Feels more like a calculated product designed to expand the Olsens' brand than an actual movie. Also, it contains ethnic stereotyping and sexual innuendo.
Resonates with genuine feeling and storytelling grace.	A tearjerker that isn't shallow and obvious about pulling the emotions out of you, and can actually be viewed more than once without blowing its shelf life.	Instead of relying on maudlin music cues and heavy-handed dialogue, Chelsom has faith enough in his script and his cast to allow them to strike emotional chords on their own.	Touching and ultimately rewarding..Culkin shines	The film is barely watchable when [Gillian Anderson is] on screen.	Heavy-handed and overwrought.
Solid	Binoche is nearly good enough to make you forget how ridiculous Chocolat was.	Serene and haunting.	Like all the French heritage pictures, this one looks terrific.	The promise of its beautiful opening is beautifully kept.	Critics are impressed with The Widow of St. Pierre's intriguing story and beautiful cinematography.
Dying just seems an excuse for a geriatric, spend-it-all Spring Break.	Although The Bucket List shouldn't sit well on the stomach, it goes down as easily as meals through an IV.	Great performances by two of the best highlight Reiner's best work in years.	There are certainly worse ways to spend the holiday season than in the company of two charming old actors, being reminded that human companionship makes life worth living, even as it makes dying a little tougher.	The leads, who were born six weeks apart in 1937, have remarkable hare-and-tortoise chemistry.	Not even the earnest performances of the two leads can rescue The Bucket List from its schmaltzy script.
The universe that is inhabited by Mary and Max is breathtaking, and must have required years of painstaking attention to detail to forge.	Beautifully animated and brilliantly written, this is a wonderfully directed black comedy that's simultaneously darkly funny, extremely sweet and incredibly moving.	The themes are nicely complemented by Elliot's animation style, which is full of wonky cityscapes and misshapen characters, something that gives this oddball story a lovely, tactile, handcrafted feel.	The animation is superb, characters endearing, humour abundant and topical themes honestly and thoroughly explored.	In a perverse and often immature way, it forthrightly deals with mature issues of love, friendship, forgiveness and mental health. It requires a mature audience, but an audience nonetheless.	Mary and Max is a lovingly crafted, startlingly inventive piece of animation whose technical craft is equaled by its emotional resonance.
Certainly not for everyone, but if slasher movies are your cup of tea this is a lot better than most, and the use of Chicago locations is especially effective.	McNaughton, co-writer Richard Fire and Rooker have pulled off an amazing feat -- a portrait of a damaged mind that refuses to explain, judge or glamorize psychopathic violence.	John McNaughton's haunting film is a grim journey into the life of its twisted subject that refuses to moralise or judge.	A drama of vivid intensity, it has all the marks of a well-made, thoughtful film that does not exploit violence for its own sake or make killing a source of entertainment.	Unflinching, rough, and ugly. Also a damn good movie.	Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is an effective, chilling profile of a killer that is sure to shock and disturb.
The story doesn't provide enough depth or entertainment to warrant a trip to the art house, wait until you can see it in the comfort of your own messy apartment.	Cleaning your place was never this much fun.	Transforms a stock male-fantasy situation into something tender and believable...	[Claude Berri's] special touch is clearly present in this film.	As a slice of life, Housekeeper is as thin they come.	Nuanced performances and an understated tone make The Housekeeper transcend its familiar premise.
At the dramatic center of SNOWPIERCER is this metaphorical concept of balance. We're taken on a journey to the front of a futuristic train, learning about an ecosystem that travels roughly over icy tracks. It's a ride worth taking.	Snowpiercer works brilliantly, the sum of extremely disparate parts that adds up to cinematic excellence.	This is a terrific, dark dystopian nightmare mixed with flashes of Terry Gilliam-esque absurdity and the filmmaker's own fractured frame of reference.	...a fairy tale of sorts with darker motives, more violence than the Grimms would envision, and some nasty things to say about libertarianism versus control.	Projecting the problems of today into a science-fiction tomorrow, [Snowpiercer] also ties them to a compelling story that keeps shifting under its characters' feet.	Snowpiercer offers an audaciously ambitious action spectacular for filmgoers numb to effects-driven blockbusters.
OK teen flick that time has treated kindly.	For sheer, silly fantasy, Footloose can't be beat.	A lively and entertaining youth drama about the coming of change in a repressive small town.	Footloose is a seriously confused movie that tries to do three things, and does all of them badly.	Footloose wasn't exactly a critical fave, but it didn't try to be hip and it had a relatively light touch, with recognizable human beings on the screen.	There's not much dancing, but what's there is great. The rest of the time, Footloose is a nice hunk of trashy teenage cheese.
Though Ice Cube and Morgan should make an ideal team, neither seems particularly comfortable grappling with Talbert's amateurish script.	First Sunday is a movie about forgiveness that asks its audience to forgive too much -- with regard to both its characters and its makers.	This anemic vehicle for Ice Cube and Tracy Morgan to mug and jive through is just weak, weak stuff.	Comedies don't have to be high in class as long as they are funny, entertaining and do not treat their audience like imbeciles. First Sunday fails all three of these qualifications.	With his movie debut, Talbert plays to his established audience, the redemption message riding roughshod over everything, even such trifling concerns as character consistency and continuity.	First Sunday may have its heart in the right place, but its funny bone is dislocated.
An object lesson in what to avoid when making the transition from low-budget films to studio productions.	An incredibly underrated scare-comedy from Peter Jackson that deserves a much wider audience.	It actually works up till its last few minutes.	Full of special effects, but still strangely 'indie', the movie has a unique sensibility ...	Talk about taking a step in the wrong direction. Peter Jackson, does your mother know what you've done?	Boasting top-notch special effects and exuberant direction from Peter Jackson, The Frighteners is visually striking but tonally uneven.
A complex, intriguing family drama centering on a young woman's feelings of guilt.	a picture that doesn't know itself: vague whenever it needs to be specific, bloats whenever it needs to trim.	...a shamelessly manipulative and melodramatic drama that's nevertheless often quite moving...	Portman is daring and strong, but Roos' misbegotten screenplay and muddled direction are hopeless.	Don Roos' movie demonstrates Natalie Portman's range, but it leans too heavily on her bad behavior, ignoring the growth the character experiences in a schizophrenic third act.	Natalie Portman and Lisa Kudrow deliver fine performances in The Other Woman, but they're muted by Don Roos' clumsy direction and cluttered, melodramatic script.
So the only real argument I can make for Eagle vs. Shark, a stupid-absurdist comedy from New Zealand, is that I laughed a lot, often despite myself, and that while I might not be able to wholly justify it, I can mount a questionable defense.	Slight yet undeniably touching, this loser comedy has some brittle wit and an odd charm. Deserves a wider audience than it's destined to find.	Self-consciously quirky but hard to dislike, with laugh-out-loud moments and a refreshingly unappealing hero.	The genius of this film is the way it keeps us laughing at the eccentricities while also challenging us to find a positive way to move forward with our lives.	As pure character study, it's a keeper.	Though there are frequent moments of wit and mordant humor, Eagle vs Shark needs more to distinguish itself from other precious, Napoleon Dynamite-ish comedies.
Killer Joe is twisted pulp, and the actors chew on it bravely, boldly, and with varying degrees of success.	The movie is gross and smutty: It is having so much fun portraying terrible people doing terrible things to one another that it has no interest in pausing to think about what any of this means. Thankfully.	Friedkin make no attempt to soften the characters' monstrousness, and thank hell for that. This is rave and rage and purge acting.	Watching "Killer Joe" to the bitter end is like playing the Pick 6 lottery and getting three of the numbers right. You don't win anything, but you still think you're smarter than all those other idiots.	You will either love "Killer Joe" or run away screaming. I absorbed this NC-17 nail bomb with awestruck admiration.	Violent, darkly comic, and full of strong performances, Killer Joe proves William Friedkin hasn't lost his touch, even if the plot may be too lurid for some.
Engrossing, if emotionally evasive - featuring Benedict Cumberbatch's exceptional performance...	Besides being an offensive disservice to the sadly not singular tragedy of Alan Turing, how is The Imitation Game? Well, it has good performances.	Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant.	The Imitation Game walks a fine line in making the familiar effective, also reflecting A Beautiful Mind at points.	Cumberbatch is not that good-looking, folks. And, his farts do NOT smell like roses. But, with that rant out of my system now, I must say he impresses as Turing. The role seems custom-made.	With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, The Imitation Game serves as an eminently well-made entry in the "prestige biopic" genre.
"Shrek Forever After" feels more like a direct-to-video release than one that should have been put in theaters.	Brilliant animation, 3D magic and a subversive script filled with quirky humour transports us to Swamp Heaven for this perfect Shrek final chapter. It's a whirlwind of a film	This fourth ogre outing delivers plenty of 3D razzle dazzle and has fun messing about with its alternate-reality storyline, but it never troubles the modernclassic status achieved by the first Shrek. Still, a chunky step up from Shrek The Third.	A rise in quality from the very pedestrian Shrek the Third.	It's sweet, mildly funny, and a pleasant enough farewell from these once beloved characters. But there's a somewhat melancholy tone to the proceedings, as we watch this franchise try to hold onto its final shreds of dignity.	While not without its moments, Shrek Forever After too often feels like a rote rehashing of the franchise's earlier entries.
The Bank Job might just be the most preposterous heist film ever made. And yet, with a few liberties here and there, most of it really did happen.	The best thing about this caper whose elements include a royal scandal, exotic locations, MI5 involvement, a brothel with a clientele from high places, corrupt cops, romance and a heist by a bunch of small-time crooks, is that it is based on fact.	This sluggishly paced caper flick fails to score.	One of the more loopy caper flicks.	True or fake, The Bank Job is a brisk entertainment that doesn't need believability to work.	Well cast and crisply directed, The Bank Job is a thoroughly entertaining British heist thriller.
Arthur's frequent returns to reality break the mood and seem to serve little narrative purpose besides beefing up Farrow's role.	Besson is a pro when it comes to action movies, but this part live, part animation effort is a mess, highlighted by creepy animation, derivative plot points and a child star who speaks way too fast.	Besson ... even dresses up the main female character in the sort of action-babe getup assigned to Milla Jovovich in his own The Fifth Element.	An odd imp of a movie, Arthur and the Invisibles may actually be filled with a bit too much invention for the average kid.	Director Luc Besson admits he knew nothing about animation before he started this project, and it shows.	Arthur wastes its big-name voice talent on a predictable script and substandard CG animation.
...Lumet effectively establishes a real sense of time and place...	There hasn't been any better film in this genre	... one of the films that brought this new realism to the screen portrait of American cops with its realistic portraits... and systemic failure and flawed, human characters behind the badges.	A remarkable record of one man's rebellion against the sort of sleaziness and second-rateness that has affected so much American life, from the ingredients of its hamburgers to the ethics of its civil servants and politicians.	Imbued with mythic and even religious dimensions, Al Pacino's resourceful, Oscar-nominated performance takes Lumet's quinessential 1970s New York film beyond the realm of a cop-corruption drama.	Serpico is an engrossing, immediate depiction of 1973 New York and includes a turn by a young Pacino that's both ferocious and career changing.
"Gone Girl" will earn plenty of loud shouts of applause, awed sounds of surprise, and shocked laughter, but what makes it worthy of them is all the hushed, uneasy conversations it's guaranteed to inspire in the long, unsettled silence to come after.	It's the kind of film we hoped David Fincher might make with Dragon Tattoo; a satisfying, ironic, and sophisticated thriller. Go see.	Once the chaotic adult-fairy-tale elements override Fincher's otherwise meticulous style, one suspects this tawdry tale of marital fury signifies nothing more than a nihilistic view of heterosexual marriage.	Amy is the most challenging and crucial character to capture, and Pike is simply brilliant in a role that has all the potential to become both career defining and life altering.	...good story...good movie, but not as good as the book and marred by a changed ending and miscasting of Neil Patrick Harris, despite fine performances by the rest of the cast.	Dark, intelligent, and stylish to a fault, Gone Girl plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike.
In Search of a Midnight Kiss is wonderfully romantic and romantically bittersweet. It's not about forever; it's about now.	Despite some scenes that have the feel of an acting or writing workshop, these are believable, complex characters. Their story has a full measure of Judd Apatow raunch, with a dash of Swingers emotional sweetness.	...a radiant romantic comedy	Though disaffect is certainly a recurrent mood, Search is a strangely heartfelt little film 1/2a lot like Swingers but with a more cynical edge.	Holdridge's film is painfully undermined by its central characters.	Funny, quirky, and bittersweet, In Search of a Midnight Kiss is a romantic comedy with a heart and a brain -- and stands as a sharp debut for director Alex Holdridge.
Not particularly funny or moving or rich, it seems unsure what kind of chocolate it wants to be.	A dream suitable for sharing or clutching greedily to one's bosom -- like a chocolate box.	A lovely, atmosphere-rich tale, a heartfelt, Capra-esque fable well suited to the coming holiday season.	Feels good going down, but for such a sweet movie, the aftertaste is oddly bitter.	Its efforts to walk on air are consistently undermined by the solemn-yet-gutless lecturing it feels compelled to inflict upon us.	Chocolat is a charmingly light-hearted fable with a lovely performance by Binoche.
Travolta's characterization, given the script and directorial demands, is okay. It will please the already-committed; but it won't win him any new fans.	Too bad the kids didn't really jump off that bridge...	In the end, the real killer is the movie's abject sincerity.	One of the best films of all time	Today mostly regarded as disco camp, Saturday Night Fever should rank as one of the great American films.	Boasting a smart, poignant story, a classic soundtrack, and a starmaking performance from John Travolta, Saturday Night Fever ranks among the finest dramas of the 1970s.
A sprawling wasteland of inflammatory tabloid moviemaking, it's more white-hot and frenetic and honestly emotional than any other movie this year.	t's loud, long and interesting, yet it also feels cold and distant.	Manages to zero in on issues of class and race, while expanding the casting assumptions of black-directed films.	Even with the slick cinematography and pulsating rock soundtrack, the final product is a big disappointment.	Lee's ensemble cast does uniformly fine work, with the often underused Leguizamo as a tremendous standout.	Spike Lee offers intense visuals but his storytelling feels crowded and overambitious.
Clearly this is a serious topic, but right from the title - meant as a child's malapropism for "totally bipolar"-the instinct is to go cute.	It often finds a lighter touch to some dark subjects. At times this is charming, but just as often, it feels tone-deaf.	Deeply personal and filled with love, Maya Forbes' Infinitely Polar Bear is nonetheless a hard movie to watch - hard to watch comfortably.	Ruffalo gives another in a string of great performances, this time as a loving father with bipolar disorder.	There's a real inner struggle conveyed by Mark Ruffalo in scenes filled with the desperation of a man forever trying to find his way to psychological freedom.	Infinitely Polar Bear handles its thorny themes with a somewhat troublesomely light touch, but Mark Ruffalo's complex performance keeps the drama solidly grounded.
Our Song has an admirably raw, unkempt air about it, as do its performances.	An honest and compelling movie about the friendship between three girls in a high school band.	An exemplary coming-of-age tale not least because it so gracefully transcends its genre.	Though a high school marching band is prominently featured, you don't have to be a band geek to get jazzed about this Song.	It is hard to imagine a movie less self-indulgent than Our Song, or one more completely absorbed in the complex humanity of its subjects.	Graced with such a realistic feel that it resembles a documentary, Our Song is a sensitive portrayal of three teenage girls.
Penn and cinematographer Eric Gautier capture with lucid beauty the feel of the road and the vastness of the wilderness.	Tempting as it might be to dismiss McCandless as a hare-brained hippie, he's not so easily reduced, and Penn does well to honor his slippery nature, even as he's clearly awed by his grand adventure.	This saga was the subject of Into the Wild, a short but fascinating book by Jon Krakauer that, 11 years later, has resulted in a gorgeously photographed and less intermittently fascinating 2 1/2-hour film by Sean Penn.	Into The Wild gets lost in a self-indulgent wilderness.	Sean Penn's achingly poetic Into the Wild seduces gently, creeping up in incremental steps. Yet in the end it leaves us drained and devastated.	With his sturdy cast and confident direction, Sean Penn has turned a complex work of non-fiction like Into the Wild into an accessible and poignant character study.
Scotsman not only lacks vision, a true sense of how to mesh Obree's sporting triumphs and personal setbacks, but it also lacks passion. What it needs, as strange and tacky as it may sound, is a bit more madness.	Manages to be both an unsatisfying human drama and a confusing sports movie at the same time. Fans of both genres will be disappointed.	It moves, but it never flies.	Obree's psychology is fascinating and, even though the competitive scenes mostly involve him racing against himself in a spectator-free indoor track, the movie manages to give its audience a suitable adrenaline rush here and there.	Tells a tale both fast and moving. And when Miller as Obree takes his whirls around the track, it gets your heart pumping and your blood up.	The Flying Scotsman's too-brisk pacing reduces the scale of cyclist Graham Obree's accomplishments while not uncovering what makes him tick.
What will rouse empathy and exasperation, though, is one teacher's attempt to act more like a colleague or mentor than an intimidating white male authority figure%u2014a teacher a student can call un ami.	...this doesn't fall into the easy cliches of the teacher at the bad school miraculously winning over the kids.	Cantet, whose parents were both teachers, carries it on and he elicits marvellous performances from a cast who are, we're assured, not merely playing versions of themselves.	...the sort of film that one admires more than one enjoys...	An uncompromising and humane look at issues facing both teachers and students, The Class is an uplifting, thought-provoking, and it's only when the final bell rings you realise just how good it is.	Energetic and bright, this hybrid of documentary style and dramatic plotting looks at the present and future of France through the interactions of a teacher and his students in an inner city high school.
As fun as the film occasionally is, it just plays like a compilation of greatest hits.	Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is easily the best stop-motion animated necrophiliac musical romantic comedy of all time. It is also just simply, wonderful: a morbid, merry tale of true love that dazzles the eyes and delights the soul.	You'd be hard pressed to find a film with this level of visual and storytelling potency this year.	Sure to please the legions of kids who have bought every Jack Skellington item at their local Hot Topic.	If only there were more going on story-wise, Corpse Bride might deserve a better reception.	As can be expected from a Tim Burton movie, Corpse Bride is whimsically macabre, visually imaginative, and emotionally bittersweet.
Early on, [Downey Jr.] remarks that his goal is to understand how and why a person can go from Juilliard to the streets. If only The Soloist had the same intent.	"The Soloist" is not a film in which you anticipate Robert Downey Jr. will be twice doused in urine. Such are the territorial markings of Joe Wright, whose directorial quirks undermine moving moments and committed performances in this musical biopic.	Although ambitious in its lyrical presentation, filmmaker Joe Wright's The Soloist plays a stale tune of cliched melancholy musical chairs.	The studio would like to sell a candied inspirational story, but director Joe Wright avoids the sugared path at all turns, producing a stunning, transcendent celluloid event.	When [Catherine] Keener's Mary Weston suggests that Lopez may be exploiting Ayers, it is tempting to wonder how the filmmakers would react to the same accusation.	Though it features strong performances by its lead players, a lack of narrative focus prevents The Soloist from hitting its mark.
Coraline's dangerous predicament, coupled with the eye-popping set design, makes for a sinister and menacing universe that provides excitement and thrills, but may be a little too intense for younger viewers used to more sanitised fare.	[Director] Selick has a great fantasy filmmaker's artistry, but he lacks that overflowing Geppetto-esque love that brings puppets to life. In Coraline, he's woozy with his own lyricism.	For all its visual delights, Coraline remains more an engaging spectacle than a connective drama.	Coraline looks fantastic and is wonderfully told, but you should probably leave your five and six year olds at home, especially if they get nightmares easily.	The effect is enchanting, and in the best sense of the word, homemade.	With its vivid stop-motion animation combined with Neil Gaiman's imaginative story, Coraline is a film that's both visually stunning and wondrously entertaining.
Stubborn, high-spirited and carefully calculated rebellion is Mr. Ghobadi's subject, and also the prevailing ethic of his film.	Ghobadi's yarn is loosely ravelled, but the songs are likable.	Transporting the audience into Tehran's illegal underworld scene of "western-influenced" music, director Bahman Ghobadi reveals America's pervasive influence of indie rock and rap music on Iran's youth.	The underground music scene in Tehran comes to life in all these different sort of clandestine studio scenes.	Over and over, the movie stops in its tracks to listen to musicians play, offering witness to their travails and ingenuity.	Bringing a dose of humor and a fresh perspective to a very serious subject, No One Knows About Persian Cats is an exhilarating, quietly powerful tribute to the courage of Iran's underground musicians.
Calling all 'Transporter' fans: Here's a fast-paced 'Transporter' sibling starring Liam Neeson!	Fortunately, somewhat-sloppy storytelling never gets in the way of this briskly paced action adventure.	Taken is a stripped-down action flick offering a single bloodlusty pleasure: You get to spend 90 minutes watching a world-class leading man cut a totally justified swath of violence through an army of central-casting scumbags.	This is not a movie about moral dilemmas-it's about a father who will rip out your eyeballs if you don't give him his daughter back.	Taken is neither original nor meaningful...but that's not really the point, is it?	Taken is undeniably fun with slick action, but is largely a brainless exercise.
This is not only the best documentary I've seen this year, it's one that shows other documentaries how to do it.	Imagine the story of Nick Drake with a happy ending and you will have some idea what to expect from this terrific, staggeringly unlikely documentary.	The rustic folk-rock sound and politically provocative lyrics provide the seductive soundtrack for the film. They often serve as a stand-in for the artist as well. It is how we get to know him.	The search for a long-lost pop icon has an unexpected payoff.	This innovative documentary tells a stranger-than-fiction tale about a remarkable Phil Ochs-like singer/songwriter from the Motor City who metaphorically rises from the dead, to the delight of his South African fans and now us.	A fascinating portrait of a forgotten musical pioneer, Searching for Sugar Man is by turns informative and mysterious.
Should have stayed in the funny pages.	One of the most entertaining and creative event movies of the Reagan-era	In sheer visual terms, this is the most convincing of the comic book movies that have been popular for the last decade or so.	This has an appealing two-dimensional comic-book look, but lacks the vision to go with it, not to mention an interesting hero or a feeling for action.	For all its superficial pleasures, Dick Tracy ultimately flounders because it provides an audience with nothing to take home and dream about.	Dick Tracy is stylish, unique, and an undeniable technical triumph, but it ultimately struggles to rise above its two-dimensional artificiality.
One might say the ultimate irony in the clash of cultures and approaches to storytelling exemplified by P.L Travers and Walt Disney's tussle over Mary Poppins, is the Disneyification of the dispute: Uncle Walt's empire enjoying the last word.	Like Disney's 'Mary Poppins,' 'Saving Mr. Banks' is pure movie magic. It's the most captivating film of 2013 for me.	The view is blocked by repetitive pathos and overlength, missing the true electricity generated by the actors and the headstrong characters they're beautifully portraying.	The movie ironically but, perhaps, indirectly, points out that Walt Disney believed his own hype. In contrast to Travers stark view of the real world, Disney looked at the world through animated rose-colored glasses.	It's a slow-moving but lightly charming story that brings back memories of the delightful Julie Andrews classic movie.	Aggressively likable and sentimental to a fault, Saving Mr. Banks pays tribute to the Disney legacy with excellent performances and sweet, high-spirited charm.
[T]otal-immersion science fiction... we are hip-deep in this sprawling, interplanetary society...	One of the most satisfying action movies in a long, long time.	Serenity isn't about effects. It's about narrative and characters, and it does a solid job in both areas.	Just when you think Whedon has fallen into the generic action film void, he injects Serenity with a dose of feeling...	an action-packed thriller with a sense of humor, several ingenious ideas and a few startling scares... full of genre-bending fun and pop-culture trivia...	Snappy dialogue and goofy characters make this Wild Wild West soap opera in space fun and adventurous.
Marvel Comics meets George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic, and an uneasy, bland alliance it is, too.	It really is that bad.	As bad as you've heard. Actually, it's worse.	Choose the part that suits your taste, but this is a case where half a movie -- either half -- is apt to be better than the whole.	Reservations aside, it's hard to fault the tongue-in-bill high spirits of a movie like Howard the Duck.	While it has its moments, Howard the Duck suffers from an uneven tone and mediocre performances.
In his first English-language feature, Muccino plays it disappointingly safe, leaving creativity by the wayside and adopting a conservative by-the-numbers style. The result is terribly maudlin and predictable.	Smith is resourceful in the role, though the story stretches one's credulity about his character's resourcefulness.	There are worse ways to spend the holidays, and, at the least, it will likely make you appreciate your own circumstances.	That Will Smith is capable of this great performance should not be surprising.	Gardner's fight is everyman's fight... to remain true to his material objectives without sacrificing that which really matters to him-- his trusting little shadow.	Will Smith's heartfelt performance elevates The Pursuit of Happyness above mere melodrama.
There's no questioning the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants trying to make it in Manhattan. It got to me.	Sheridan finds room to examine the experience of immigrants, AIDS patients, struggling artists, pregnant mothers, and fathers losing faith in both themselves and God	Sheridan's semi-personal immigration drama is simple and modest to a fault but it's sporadically touching and well acted, particularly by Samantha Morton, who deserves an Oscar nod.	From its first frame to its final fade-out, In America is about her family's passage into the land of dreams, a place where wishes do come true, but only if you understand how to make them.	Lesson-laden, tear-jerking fairy tale.	A rich and moving story about an immigrant family adjusting to life in New York.
Packs laughs, over-the-top plot twists and even a socially conscious message or two into a twisted story about the ruthless competition between a couple of would-be managers in a sprawling department store.	El Crimen Perfecto has energy, color, spirit and lively performances, but what it does not have are very many laughs.	Dark comedy with lots of laughs - too bad the ending doesn't fit the ferpecto beginning.	Though the movie's tremendously funny and entertaining, it's also very nicely shot	The Spanish have been masters of sly black comedy, and El Crimen Perfecto (The Perfect Crime) is a splendid example.	If you like your comedies wicked and pitch-black, El Crimen Perfecto delivers without flinching.
The raw power of the material, accompanied by breathtaking acting, lift the film to fascinating drama.	We never doubt where Mullan's polemical biases lie, [but] such simplifications rob the movie of much of its dramatic effect.	Angry and deliberately provocative, The Magdalene Sisters sets out to offend those who deserve it.	A grim and unmistakable masterpiece of bleak, black sorrow.	Too much like a sexualized Dickensian rant right out of Nicholas Nickelby or Oliver Twist to ever rise beyond the level of obvious propaganda.	A typical women-in-prision film made untypical because it's based on real events.
Brown's panic is capably rendered, but his ordeals are not worth enduring to the bitter end.	...one of the most exciting, flat-out captivating thrillers to come around in quite some time.	[A] hilarious satire on male inadequacy disguised as an outrageously violent crime thriller. It's all the d*ck-measuring and overcompensating elevated out of the subtext to actively fuel the humor and the suspense...	"Headhunters" is a well-oiled, nasty machine.	in this cat-and-mouse thriller, while red herrings might be expected, it is the black comedy that is the real surprise, rescuing Headhunters from both Norwegian dourness and Tinseltown blandness.	Grisly, twisty, and darkly comic, Headhunters is an exhilaratingly oddball take on familiar thriller elements.
For a topic as inherently boring as economics, [director Patrick] Creadon has managed a creditable job of keeping our attention throughout I.O.U.S.A.	Bottom line: The party's over. There's no such thing as a free lunch. America itself may be a bubble.	A documentary about the U.S. addiction to debt, I.O.U.S.A. could have easily taken the title of another movie released this week, What Just Happened?	Though the filmmaking is playful at times, the film is essentially 90 percent message, 10 percent movie. Then again, sometimes a message is important enough to make other considerations seem irrelevant.	If you believe the terrifying documentary I.O.U.S.A., America is headed for a financial crisis of monumental proportions - and apparently, we are probably too late to keep it from happening.	A potent and lithely constructed documentary about America's financial crisis, I.O.U.S.A grabs you with figures but holds you with irreverent wit.
You will have made your mind up about Babs one way or the other, but for the rare uninitiated, this is a fine introduction to her talents.	A worthwhile nostalgia trip.	Streisand is stunning, but the film is a trial, particularly when the music disappears somewhere around the 90-minute mark and all that's left is leaden melodrama.	Dazzling musical romance is long but entertaining.	In any other hands this might seem like paper-thin stuff, but Streisand's a consummate professional with the Midas touch.	Barbara Streisand elevates this otherwise rote melodramatic musical with her ultra-memorable star turn as Fanny Brice.
After the promisingly nasty beginning, the filmmakers settle into a sort of campaign mode, lulling and flattering the audience with a fairy-tale vision of the common man's victory over the Washington establishment.	Darned near the Second Coming of Capra in Reitman's account of common decency under siege by political treacheries.	In spite of this sogginess, and despite a self-congratulatory, do-gooder streak that the film discovers within Dave, this comedy remains bright and buoyant much of the way through.	Pleasant comedy for older kids and up.	Offers feel-good guffaws.	Ivan Reitman's refreshingly earnest political comedy benefits from an understated, charming script and a breezy performance by Kevin Kline.
A brilliant directorial debut.	Emotions of friendship, infatuation and love bound off the screen with such potency and authenticity that you can't help but think, 'Yes, yes, exactly, I have been there, I have felt that, that is life!'	An amusing distraction with clever writing and performances.	Everything seems too glossy, crises are resolved too easily, situations seem pat.	We could be looking at a word-of-mouth sleeper here.	A dramedy featuring an unusual love triangle, Keeping the Faith is a perceptive look at how religion affects us in everyday life.
Nearly as exuberant as the original, How to Train Your Dragon 2 nimbly avoids sequel-itis.	The characters in this movie are charmers. They've got me so well-trained, I'm even looking forward to HTTYD3.	Continues a very compelling mythology I hope carries in to the third film.	How refreshing it is to find a summer sequel that's not simply louder or wackier than its predecessor, but rather feels like an extension of its first film and all of its best qualities.	It's a rip-roaring ride.	Exciting, emotionally resonant, and beautifully animated, How to Train Your Dragon 2 builds on its predecessor's successes just the way a sequel should.
If you love stories with powdered wigs and scandal, you won't want to miss "The Duchess."	Provided you don't take it seriously, it makes for an addictively entertaining diversion that's as hard to stop watching as the books are to stop reading.	Considerable talent lifts this wallowing soap opera up to a more powerful and accomplished level.	Focusing on the costumes and frippery, rather than the inherent drama of Georgiana Spencer's dilemma, diminishes its impact.	Director Saul Dibb pretends that all this stuff is new without actually making it so, and Knightley provides a few requisite Oscar clips with her performance.	While The Duchess treads the now-familiar terrain of the corset-ripper, the costumes look great and Keira Knightley's performance is stellar in this subtly feminist, period drama.
Cop Out marks a new low which is really saying something given that Smith's the man behind Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Jersey Girl.	Kevin Smith's hilarious homage to 1980s buddy cop action comedies.	Smith and the screenwriters keep trotting out one limp gag after another, including a foul-mouthed child car thief and a parkour routine that ends in a splat.	The victim swears the director is one Kevin Smith. Yet the high level of non-funniness here, registering 7.6 on a yawn-alyzer, suggests Mr. Smith is being impersonated by a talentless gun-for-hire trying to pass for someone who can make people	How's the idea of a grown man punching an 11-year-old in the groin sound? There you go.	Cop Out is a cliched buddy action/comedy that suffers from stale gags and slack pacing.
[Director Laura] Dunn's elegant, full-length debut presents a frightening and powerful argument against the kind of reckless, profit-driven land development that not only threatens natural resources, but life itself.	A thought-provoking documentary that's both informative and strangely poignant--as well as beautifully shot and edited.	Helmer [Laura] Dunn, though her heart is on her sleeve, gives an even-handed view of things from both sides.	The kind of transformative viewing experience that has made the current period a golden age for nonfiction film.	If The Unforeseen has a fault, it would be a slight lack of focus. A flawed, but beautiful documentary.	A calm documentary that doesn't resort to shrill polemics, The Unforeseen also benefits from great interview subjects and jaw-dropping cinematography.
The Ya-Ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better. Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be Ya-Ya.	What have we done to deserve this treacly, badly-acted nonsense? Whose children have we run over in a previous life?	This Southern-belle saga is convinced that it's charming enough to mow down any viewer's skepticism. For the most part, its confidence is justified.	Ya-Ya. Yuk-Yuk.	Well-made, but frequently boring and predictable drama -- a couple of decent performances but the climax doesn't work and it's all been done better elsewhere.	Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is more melodramatic than emotionally truthful, and uneven in its mixture of time periods, actresses, laughter and tears.
Would most likely have made for a decent late-night Cinemax staple, but its stabs at higher significance only bring on the giggles.	For its ever shifting attitudes toward men, women, and murder, Waist Deep is one of the sloppiest movies ever to reach the screen.	A carjacking leads to violence, revenge and antiheroes impossible to root for in Waist Deep, an urban gangster crime-thriller.	Marred by absurd plot digressions and choppy, sloppy and incoherent shaky-camera action sequences.	Skillfully directed by Vondie Curtis-Hall, Waist Deep is a taut, grittily entertaining B-movie reminiscent of the gangster films that Warner Bros. used to crank out with assembly line efficiency in the 1930s and '40s.	A well-meaning B-movie that suffers from a cliche-ridden script and poorly drawn characters that fail to inspire much sympathy.
...more self-congratulatory than genuinely edgy, and the best reason to see it is MacLachlan's tidy impersonation.	Touch Of Pink is more of a save than a genuinely good movie. I'm recommending it because it turns out so much better than its clumsy start would lead anyone to expect.	It takes a while for him to find the right pace and rhythm, but the overall result is diverting yet provocative, and Rashid is as strong a director of actors as he is a writer capable of creating complex, multifaceted characters.	Ian Iqbal Rashid's movie, flawed as it is, works precisely because of its fantasy elements.	Kyle MacLachlan's robust impersonation of Cary Grant is good for a laugh, but its overuse is just one of the crimes against this joyless cross-cultural gay romance.	Kyle MacLachlan does a very good imitation Cary Grant in this forced and contrived tale.
Like all of Almodóvar's films, Bad Education takes the audience down unexpected roads and switchbacks.	Almodóvar has toyed with film noir before, most memorably in his 1997 film Live Flesh. But his newest movie, Bad Education, is a delirious, headlong immersion and re-invention of a style.	An hour in, everything in the movie is upended in a way that is not so much difficult to swallow as simply out of left field.	Tal vez La Mala Educación sea su película más honesta, más íntima, más personal, sin que ello signifique necesariamente una autobiografía.	A heady mix of Franco-era repression, gay relationships and religious education all wrapped up in some of the conventions of film noir.	A layered, wonderfully-acted, and passionate drama.
The creepiest version yet of the Magical Negro routine	Will Smith's previous film with director Gabriele Muccino, The Pursuit of Happyness, was a tale well told. Their new one is a gimmicky tale annoyingly told.	Not a bad tearjerker for the holiday season and as Smith's in it, it'll probably make a mint.	Más allá de lo caprichoso de la historia, e incluso de lo fragmentario del relato -a lo 21 Gramos- es innegable la capacidad que exhibe Muccino para atrapar la atención del espectador.	El ritmo de la cinta es algo lento en un inicio pero después mejora, aunque hay que decirlo, se siente la mano manipuladora del director que parece haber estado más concentrado en pensar si el público se sentiría conmovido que en hacer un filme memorable.	Grim and morose, Seven Pounds is also undone by an illogical plot.
Even when it's only got its vampire wings on, this film has a lot more bite than the Twilight series.	Low-budget vampire apocalypse flick that makes up for in mood and ideas what it lacks in flash and pizazz.	It may try to cram too much incident into the narrative and loses its way from time to time, but this is a superior horror.	Like Romero, Mickle has a pragmatic attitude to genre convention: even the corniest stereotypes can be turned to new purposes.	This is The Road meets Testament by way of The Devil's Rejects, in the best possible way: a brutal, elegiac take on how a post-apocalyptic America might look and feel.	Though the genre is well worn at this point, director Jim Mickle focuses on strong characterization and eerie atmosphere to craft an effective apocalyptic vampire chiller that also manages to pack a mean punch.
Irreverent and politically incorrect, it's a poignant, melancholy morality tale - with a savvy, smart, self-aware performance by Paul Giamatti.	Giamatti and Hoffman are so much fun, and they are tied to a narrative that, while slightly overambitious, never flags	Despite the deficiencies in the script, everyone on screen works effectively hard to build a full story of a fairly average human being who can't seem to appreciate his own life, much less those around him.	The actors are the whole show here, trapped in characters never really worth their time, or ours.	An acting showcase with more mood swings than its drunken protagonist.	With a magnificent performance by Paul Giamatti, Barney's Version offers much comedy and insight to the complexities of modern romance.
It's hard not to smile at this one and be moved by it at the same time. (Anniversary Edition)	This is the dullest and least successful adaptation of the Christmas chestnut I've ever seen.	Fun, but seems to be missing a magical tone that'd you'd hope for when combining the Muppets and Dickens.	Director Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson, has captured his father's vision and carries on the tradition better than anyone could have expected.	The fit between sentiment and satire is not always a comfortable one and the more dedicated fans of either the story or the Muppets may leave theaters dissatisfied.	It may not be the finest version of Charles Dickens' tale to grace the screen, but The Muppet Christmas Carol is funny and heartwarming, and serves as a good introduction to the story for young viewers.
Deliriously alive on screen, with an energy that's often electrifying, it's a movie that in its best moments recalls Scorsese's gangster classic GoodFellas, with a bit of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights thrown in to sweeten the pot.	"American Hustle" is what might result if a movie snorted cocaine.	American Hustle contains fireworks aplenty-dramatic outbursts of bravura filmmaking, sly acting choices, a scene that makes Robert De Niro scary again-but also a few too many familiar moments.	Overweight, balding, and outfitted in supremely ugly '70s high fashion-I seem to recall a pumpkin-colored polyester three-piece suit-Bale has never looked worse, or been better.	A zany comedy that makes FBI agents look like keystone cops.	Riotously funny and impeccably cast, American Hustle compensates for its flaws with unbridled energy and some of David O. Russell's most irrepressibly vibrant direction.
Cute and amusing.	This fringe milieu is inhabited with all sorts of eccentric characters to wring laughs from.	You're rocking with laughter at the film with the most inventive improvisational dialogue of the year.	Christopher Guest and his well-groomed entourage of improv artists push pseudo dog show mentality to the upper limits of droll wit in Best in Show.	Not quite strong enough for a champion status, Best in Show still makes a pretty solid case for runner-up.	A fine example of writer-director-star Christopher Guest's gift for improv comedy, Best in Show boasts an appealingly quirky premise and a brilliantly talented cast.
About as fresh and vital as a fifth-generation dub of The Star Wars Holiday Special.	The temptation exists to call the movie one missed opportunity, but honestly, I don't think anyone involved in this mess ever seriously tried to make something good.	For a would-be frightfest built around a supernatural premise, One Missed Call is so glum and businesslike that it's not nearly as much pulpy fun as it should be.	The unintentional camp makes for some eye-rolling interest early on, and French director Eric Valette does manage a few hair-raising moments, but by then, the movie has missed by a mile.	Another demonstration of how certain studios and producers care neither about us nor the skill required to pull off a respectable work of garbage.	One of the weakest entries in the J-horror remake sweepstakes, One Missed Call is undone by bland performances and shopworn shocks.
A dreamy triumph for Scorsese	A passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure, Hugo dazzlingly conjoins the earliest days of cinema with the very latest big screen technology.	Just as sure as Hugo will make some viewers restless, it's also guaranteed to provide everyone who sees it with an astonishing array of dazzling sequences to remember forever.	Movie magic hangs in the air of Martin Scorsese's Hugo, much like the steam and dust that fills almost every frame.	"Hugo" is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life.	Hugo is an extravagant, elegant fantasy with an innocence lacking in many modern kids' movies, and one that emanates an unabashed love for the magic of cinema.
A perennially unsettling masterpiece from which modern chillers could learn much.	... one of the most beautiful pastoral nightmares the cinema has seen.	This thriller is one of the great masterpieces of American cinema, a movie so strangely repellent, so poetic and so utterly hypnotic that it sadly never found an audience.	The Night of the Hunter (1955) is a truly compelling and terrifying classic masterpiece thriller, and the only film ever directed by actor Charles Laughton	Easily ranks among the greatest American films.	Featuring Robert Mitchum's formidable performance as child-hunting preacher, The Night of the Hunter is a disturbing look at good and evil.
Pausing the special effects kills the established oomph, bestowing tedious exposition to actors who aren't skilled enough to make their transformations interesting, led around by an overwhelmed Apted.	So vivid are many of Lewis's tableaux that you are barely given time to linger before being whisked on to the next.	At least the sea serpent -- part cobra, part eel -- is fierce, and welcome...	This f/x-heavy third adaptation of the Christian-themed fantasy series feels routine and risk-averse in every respect, as if investment anxiety had fatally hobbled its sense of wonder.	The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is still very much a "Narnia" movie. In other words, it's filled with fantastical creatures, bloodless battles, quasi-mystical undercurrents and an unfortunate helping of hooey.	Its leisurely, businesslike pace won't win the franchise many new fans, but Voyage of the Dawn Treader restores some of the Narnia franchise's lost luster with strong performances and impressive special effects.
A cluttered, uninspired hash of familiar genre ideas.	I wanted to enjoy Dylan Dog: Dead of Night, if only because films of this ilk are rarely produced anymore. However, it's a bust. An extraordinarily talky, tedious, unmonstery bust.	Director Munroe is clearly a fan and attempted his best on an admittedly limited budget, but some things just don't translate that well.	The movie wants to be a combination film noir and horror comedy, but the timing is all off and the performances are flat across the board.	Lets the likeable erstwhile Superman do his best impression of a jaded P.I., down to one of the most ineffectually boyish attempts at a grizzled voiceover in memory.	An uninspired, feebly-acted horror/comedy that produces little scares and laughs.
As the plot has as many complications as characters, much of the fun comes in watching Scripter Samson Raphaelson neatly tangle and untangle them without tying himself in a hard knot.	Thoroughly different from To Be or Not To Be but just as exhilarating, it's one of the few films truly justifying Lubitsch's reputation for a 'touch.'	This charming and well-scripted comedy exploits the ingenious set-up with delightful results.	Wonderful period low-budget light romantic comedy taking place during the Depression among a few underpaid neurotics surviving in the workforce of a small notions store.	The charm of the gimmick in Lubitsch's take is passed over quickly in favor of studying both its effects on those involved, as well as the dynamics of the workplace at large.	Deftly directed by Ernst Lubitsch from a smart, funny script by Samson Raphaelson, The Shop Around the Corner is a romantic comedy in the finest sense of the term.
Watching Where the Heart Is, in fact, is a little like listening to the town gossip run her mouth about everyone she knows.	The scenes feel forced, producing episodic plotting and calling attention to the characters' superficiality.	Sure, there are men in this movie, but they simply cannot compete with the likes of Portman, Sarandon, Channing, Judd, Cusack, and Fields.	The movie isn't all that much -- it's too cloyingly ramshackle -- but Portman isn't playing down to her character this time around.	Terrific, grounded performances by Natalie Portman as Novalee and Ms. Judd as Lexie are the saving graces of the movie.	Poor script and messy plot undermines the decent cast.
When he's not keening and shucking and jiving and behaving altogether spastically, Cuba kicks into full-on "dramatic mode" and the results are unquestionably more amusing.	That its title isn't something of an ironic warning is mostly the product of the fact that no one in their right mind was ever tempted in the first place.	The Fighting Temptations exists for its rousing gospel soundtrack, which is at times so good that you can forgive the movie its flaws.	Implausible and predictable.	A mildly entertaining comedy, carried by its rousing Gospel choir numbers, about the internal makeover of a selfish liar who finds community just when he needs it most.	The music is the only saving grace in this predictable and eager-to-please comedy.
Alexandrowicz manages to express most of his ideas without getting too heavy-handed, and the low-key tone is refreshing -- not just the humor but also the characterizations and story developments.	A morality tale that transcends its specific details to resonate with a universality.	Here is a creative parable about a young Christian pilgrim from Africa whose quest to see the holy city is set aside as he undergoes a series of trials and tribulations.	An engaging and poignant film, one that could only be done by an insider.	A deceptively modest fable of innocence abroad that resonates with the situation within Israel and without.	A smart and funny social satire about modern-day Jerusalem.
Perhaps a productive use for Daddy Day Camp may be found among death row inmates who wish to make their final minutes feel like weeks.	Daddy Day Camp should just limp off to the nurse's tent and call it quits.	If your idea of fun is an hour and a half surrounded by screaming, whining, vomiting children, then this may be your movie.	The worst kind of sequel. No original stars or director, just a cobbled-together script by one of the writers of Daddy Day Care. There should have been a big red flag when Eddie Murphy declined to appear.	Have your little ones already seen Ratatouille and rented Thunderpants?	A mirthless, fairly desperate family film, Daddy Day Camp relies too heavily on bodily functions for comedic effect, resulting in plenty of cheap gags but no laughs.
Vavooom!	For all the three-dimensional attractions of its two leading ladies, this is a rather flat cinemusical.	Smashing.	[A] frothy, thoroughly enjoyable frolic.	Sensuais ao extremo, as duas protagonistas conquistam o espectador em números como aquele em que Russell canta em meio a atletas e Monroe faz seu número clássico de Diamonds are a girl's best friend.	Anchored by Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell's sparkling magnetism, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a delightfully entertaining 1950s musical.
The fast pace and force-fed wisecracks are as seamless as ever, but rarely has audience laughter sounded as hollow.	Fans of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' Indiana Jones series may rest assured that the latest installment, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, is fully up to, as well as virtually indistinguishable from, its predecessors.	The Last Crusade is a step backward for [Spielberg], but backwardness is an integral part of the Indy series right from its kiddie-matinee origins.	Harrison Ford overacts. Everytime he says "dad," I want to cringe.	As usual, the action is on an epic scale and delivered with breathless enthusiasm and much panache by director Steven Spielberg.	Lighter and more comedic than its predecessor, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade returns the series to the brisk serial adventure of Raiders, while adding a dynamite double act between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.
What makes MARCH OF THE PENGUINS such a fascinating film to watch is the thought that someone was crazy enough to actually go and film it.	Birth, death, romance, danger: All play a role in Jacquet's homage to a remarkably endearing creature.	A real charmer even if it's no Winged Migration.	For the emperor penguin, celibacy is not an option.	Beautiful, stimulating and painstaking.	Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc.
A snappy, fun adaptation that entertains young viewers without speaking down to them.	Mrs. Ladybug sums it all up with one marvelous line, though: 'It's better than aphids.' Who am I to argue?	At its lyrical best, James and the Giant Peach, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1961 children's classic, evokes the casual enchantment of a book that, for many kids (including me), cast the spell of a goofily blissed-out mirage.	This very unconventional tale is well-told with an imaginative combination of live-action and stop-motion animation, all colored with Selick's uniquely dramatic, preternatural aesthetics.	This weird story has been transformed into a playful, visually arresting experience with more than a few allusions to The Wizard of Oz.	The arresting and dynamic visuals, offbeat details and light-as-air storytelling make James and the Giant Peach solid family entertainment.
One of Coppola's very best.	A masterpiece of mounting paranoia.	There's a strong case to be made for The Conversation being Coppola's greatest film. Which, when you consider what else he's made, is high praise indeed.	Hackman is fabulous in a performance that might be the best of his career.	A wonderfully intelligent experience.	This tense, paranoid thriller presents Francis Ford Coppola at his finest -- and makes some remarkably advanced arguments about technology's role in society that still resonate today.
Though it keeps raising the stakes, it never actually allows anything to happen. It is intent on remaining a talky drama.	To borrow a phrase from Pauline Kael, Intimate Strangers suggests bits of Alfred Hitchcock and bits of Woody Allen. But the wrong bits.	A handsome, intelligent film that feels as restrained as its protagonist -- a comic premise without many laughs, a thriller without many thrills.	A small masterpiece of tonal balance.	A seamless, sensual film; its dialogue is sprinkled with double entendre and wit.	Intimate Strangers is Hitchcockian noir with a Gallic twist: Rather than simply imitating the genre's form, director/screenwriter Patrice Leconte delves into the underlying psychological drama.
A lot fresher than its premise, largely because of the terrific casting.	Makes no emotional or narrative sense.	Often 13 Going on 30's pleasures aren't deep so much as they are the trained responses to a push of our MTV-programmed buttons.	It's not silly enough to be a youth comedy and not sophisticated enough to be a satisfying adult movie.	Whenever [Garner's] on screen you don't want to look anywhere else.	The plot's nothing new, but Garner shows a lovable flair for romantic comedies.
Director Beeban Kidron spends most of her time re-working the original movie's formulas.	Instead of laughing with Bridget, The Edge of Reason laughs at her.	With the exception of Zellweger, it's a film that has assembled its cast only for continuity of facial recognition and nothing so important as story, characters or emotion.	In the strain to explore new territory, the film pushes into areas that that don't fit comfortably into the lightly comic world of Bridget Jones.	A little too much like the movie version of a 'greatest hits' package -- only with the originals replaced by engaging but uninspired cover versions of all the songs.	Edge of Reason is a predictable continuation to the Bridget Jones story, with too much slapstick and silliness.
The greatest excuse yet to get that anti-M. Night petition started. The last thing we want is a future of Shyamalan films with the knowledge that we all could have done something sooner.	A patchy, uninspired eco-thriller whose R rating (a first for Shyamalan) looks more like a B.O. hindrance than an artistic boon.	Shyamalan's approach is more effective than smash-and-grab plot-mongering. His use of the landscape is disturbingly effective. The performances by Wahlberg and Deschanel bring a quiet dignity to their characters.	Shyamalan crafts a somewhat chilling cautionary tale; it just might have been more chilling if he had been a little less cautious.	Bad and weird.	The Happening begins with promise, but unfortunately descends into an incoherent and unconvincing trifle.
Fans like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan express unvarnished awe, but it's the well-told arc of Seeger's life that makes the strongest impression, as director Jim Brown takes us from the highs to the lows and back up again.	An amazing man and an amazing film.	More than an appreciation, Pete Seeger: The Power of Song is an inspiration.	You sense that Seeger may feel his greatest legacy is not what he accomplished, but what his presence gave others the courage to accomplish. Even if it was just singing along with a roomful of strangers.	Shallow, very officially sanctioned, and overly compressed.	Pete Seeger: The Power of Song is both a tribute to a legendary singer and an informative account of the birth of American counterculture.
Above Mission Impossible and Twister put together. But being better than two bloated, style-over-substance movies does not equal good.	What The Rock does best is pay homage to some of the classic, if not well-worn, films and themes to emerge from Hollywood in the last three decades.	One hell of a story -- and hands down the best action flick of the year to date.	There isn't a shot, scene or sequence in The Rock that doesn't move furiously, typically with colored lights flashing into our faces or onto those of the actors.	When film more or less took over melodrama from the theater ninety years ago, it proudly provided real oceans instead of canvas waves rippled by stagehands; but the plots remained humbug ... The Rock is as ridiculous an example as one could want.	For visceral thrills, it can't be beat. Just don't expect The Rock to engage your brain.
a high school fantasy for indie rock nerds... but sadly, it's not as much fun as it looks	It's like looking through a dreamy, indiemope kaleidoscope at a party you're not invited to, and, frankly, not even sure you'd want to attend.	It is a fresh and engaging film that thankfully lacks the schmaltz and sentimentality of most romcoms aimed at older age-groups.	This movie is so cute. They're not pushing anything. It's just sweet behavior. There's nothing outrageous. It's all just mellow moving through situations, and every minor act has such a heartfelt motivation.	Sputters like a broken iPod ... Cera's Juno character would probably hate this movie.	Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist combines a pair of charming leads, the classic New York backdrop, and a sweet soundtrack.
In Every Little Step, life imitates art, art reflects life, and the distinctions threaten, quite pleasantly, to blur altogether.	It's all up there on the screen in this impassioned, exhilarating documentary. They want to dance for you. It's what they did for love.	... wonderfully entertaining and emotionally genuine ... Every Little Step actually improves on the original.	I know what to expect. I am going to see some dancers make it, some not make it, and that's what it is.	Broadway fans -- as well as aficionados of A Chorus Line -- should get a kick out of Every Little Step.	Fascinating and insightful, Every Little Step is a thoroughly engrossing behind the scenes look at Broadway performers.
There are only so many ways you can frame a bunch of hairy men and a token girl stumbling over the prow of a hill while moaning about being thirsty, before it gets boring.	Weir and cowriter Keith R. Clarke resist the temptation to add Hollywood happy endings to Rawicz's story.	The abiding sensation, at the end, is one not of fulfillment but of exhaustion.	..extreme challenge of human endeavour that ends with an overwhelming flush of emotion	Landscape trumps character in The Way Back, just as the Siberian and Mongolian wilderness overwhelms the seven gulag escapees at the heart of Peter Weir's 1940-set film.	It isn't as emotionally involving as it should be, but this Peter Weir epic offers sweeping ambition and strong performances to go with its grand visual spectacle.
The delivery in Idiocracy is frequently flat, but its vision is dead-on.	We may look back at this film in 500 years and realize that Mike Judge was better able to predict the future than Arthur C. Clarke did with 2001: A Space Odyssey.	So-so attempt at revisiting Sleeper. Unfortunately Mike Judge is no Woody Allen, nor is Woody Allen himself nowadays.	It's a low-boil affair from the Office Space auteur that wears out its dumb-and-dumbest playbook early on.	Even if some of the gags about dumb people start becoming tiresome, it's linked to a sensation of discomfort that should make us legitimately worry about the direction we're headed in.	Idiocracy delivers the hilarity and biting satire that could only come from Mike Judge.
It illuminates profoundly in matters of class, age, family, friendship, economics and even nationality.	...a bittersweet study of a happy family, its discontented satellites and the ways we sabotage ourselves.	The performances are winning, the story is surprising without relying on unlikely twists, and the relationships are the richest and most nuanced since Leigh's Secrets & Lies.	A penetrating study of happiness, the search for happiness, and the impossibility of happiness for some.	Another Year, a terrific new Mike Leigh movie, assesses that moment in every thinking person's life when the question "what now?" exceeds physical survival.	Characterized by strong performances and the director's trademark feel for the nuances of everyday life, Another Year marks another solid entry in Mike Leigh's career of kitchen-sink English drama.
...as the credits rolled, I did hope for more.	What biopics and issue-driven films could be if they had the guts to go beyond the easy answers.	The characters are not plot-serving constructs, so they behave in ways that are often contradictory, much like real people.	Luke is ... a relatable stand-in for those who may be falsely accused - and seething - in prisons of our own.	It doesn't quite have the adrenaline to be a great thriller, but Catch a Fire makes up for it with compelling characters and a genuinely important theme, skillfully told. There's not much else you can ask from a film than that.	No stranger to the political thriller, director Phillip Noyce tackles apartheid and terrorism with experienced gusto, while Derek Luke and Tim Robbins hand in nuanced performances.
While it obviously won't appeal to all viewers, the film benefits enough from some charming performances, as well as a unique enough storyline that will keep viewers wondering where it's headed, to earn a passing grade.	The film ends up never quite explaining what makes Adam tick.	This sprightly romantic comedy proves that the most seductive phrase in the English language is 'I need you.'	An airy, accented romantic comedy romp of infidelity and animal attraction [that hinges on] your personal threshold for average, of-the-moment romantic comedies.	Smart, sexy and uncompromised.	Although some of the characters' motivation may not be that clear, the movie is still a funny and sexy charmer.
I've Loved You So Long is a love letter to family. It's an homage to the restorative power of love. It's a gift of forgiveness.	I've Loved You So Long is a heart-rending movie that takes the audience by surprise.	Scott Thomas' spare movements and flinty expression reflect Juliette's will to hold in her emotions like a dam about to burst - and when it finally does, the results are heartbreaking.	A scintillating drama about pain and healing made with intelligence and compassion.	Kristen Scott Thomas' performance is the backbone to an emotionally moving story about a woman searching for redemption within herself. Seek this out!	I've Loved You So Long is a sublimely acted family drama as well as a noteworthy directorial debut from Phillipe Claudel.
While the message that a girl can defend herself against the boys threatening her is a good one, it's lost in a movie where the bullies look like Mussolini's bodyguards and where Julie waits for her boyfriend and Miyagi to come to her defense.	Swank and Morita make a personable pair, enough so that we don't miss Macchio. The monks exude a benevolent presence in a film less trivial than it could have been.	Swank, here demonstrating that for as wooden and exasperating as her performance is in this picture, it's the only performance she's ever contributed to any film.	Not that girls will go see this or boys will care.	The overt message of any Karate Kid movie: Don't fight unless you absolutely have to. The implicit message: You'll always have to. Let the smitings begin!	The Next Karate Kid is noteworthy for giving audiences the chance to see a pre-Oscars Hilary Swank, but other than a typically solid performance from Pat Morita, this unnecessary fourth installment in the franchise has very little to offer.
If it never quite reaches the heights of comic brilliance that Brooks and his lunatic cast achieved in 1968, it still generates plenty of laughs.	If The Producers isn't the most perfect movie musical in years, then it comes pretty damn close	My suggestion: rent the original	If you're not laughing at The Producers, you have no sense of humor and if you're somehow offended, you are a moron not worthy of its genius.	The small, silly details that made you laugh in spite of yourself are only garish and hammy on a screen the size of a mobile trailer.	Despite the rich source material, The Producers has a stale, stagy feel more suited to the theater than the big screen.
Gripping, heartfelt and eye-opening film.	In a way, "Devil" is two horror stories, the first is what Steidle saw in Darfur, the second what he saw when he left.	It is difficult to fault a film that only asks for an end to an unfathomably evil campaign that has left some 400,000 dead, and another 2.5 million homeless.	The Devil Came on Horseback means to upset you. To this end, it presents Steidle's photos and very vocal frustrations.	more than a great film, it's also the rare kind of non-fiction film that can actually open eyes.	The Devil Came on Horseback is both a strong primer on the complexities of the situation in Darfur and a harrowing first-person doc.
Great camera work and postproduction combined with the genuine grit of police work make this a film to see.	The mosaic of cases and caseworkers is like a season of The Wire distilled into two hours.	Whatever you think of it, you won't be neutral.	This hard-driving drama won't disappoint art-house crowds.	Sure, you've seen this sort of material before -- comparisons to HBO's "The Wire" are frequent and obvious -- but when it's done right, as it is here, it's gripping.	Polisse is a gripping and powerful procedural drama filled with fine acting and unflinching eye for truth and brutality.
There's a distinct thrill in watching in watching a movie that's confident enough in the material its presenting that it doesn't constantly feel the need to stop and explain itself.	Even in its most perplexing moments, it's always a delight to watch thanks to the astonishing performances and the gorgeous 70mm imagery.	a compelling, beautiful, troubling puzzle of a film	Anderson cunningly lets the viewer add the "sinister" here. We can ponder a group that sees value in collecting and guarding the secrets of its members, that seeks out celebrities, the passion for litigation as a means of battling those who question it.	Gorgeous to look at and an absolute feast of strong and interesting acting.	Smart and solidly engrossing, The Master extends Paul Thomas Anderson's winning streak of challenging films for serious audiences.
There are a couple of decently staged fight scenes, but there's no visceral charge to this visually undistinguished and monotonously formulaic action film.	Think of what might happen if someone grafted parts of Batman and Robin onto The Crow, and you'll have an idea of how unpalatable The Punisher is.	An uneven yet workable mix of deft humor, slam-bang action and colorful pulp-novel punch.	[S]uffering is the whole point of the story. That may make viewers who haven't disengaged all of their higher thought processes somewhat uncomfortable.	Acted and directed with conviction.	A good cast fails to elevate this overly violent and by-the-numbers revenge flick.
You also have to admire the creepy arrogance of Schwartzman's performance.	The charm is a little too forced, the story barely believable, and its allure overly-calculated.	The music of life compressed into a ninety minute sonata.	Rushmore is intended to be hip and funny, but it's not really either.	One of the most original, good-hearted comedies in a long time, Rushmore is the sort of movie where the strangest sequences of discords somehow keep managing to reach giddily improbable resolutions.	This cult favorite is a quirky coming of age story, with fine, off-kilter performances from Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray.
Just because someone wants to tell you a story you've already heard doesn't mean that person won't tell it in a way that totally entertains you, even when it take two hours and 40 minutes to do that.	Superfly vs. Serpico!	A cultivated and more temperate version of Scarface.	American Gangster isn't bad or poorly-made or unsatisfactory; it's just good enough to make you painfully aware of all the ways it could have been better, too big and observed to watch as simple entertainment and too glossy and glib to watch as meaningful	Well-crafted but eerily familiar....while they were making it, the crew dubbed it, "Superfly meets Serpico."	American Gangster is a gritty and entertaining throwback to classic gangster films, with its lead performers firing on all cylinders.
A histуria bem amarrada й beneficiada ainda pelo senso de humor seco e eficaz, ao passo que o elenco confere charme a um bando de personagens inescrupulosos e a direзгo de Vaughn, associada а inventiva montagem, torna o filme sempre instigante.	The newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years.	Matthew Vaughn's confident debut's reserved pace and composed nastiness lends the action a matter-of-fact menace.	The film's a diverting enough 105 minutes, with a few surprises in store.	[Craig] is a great anti-hero, tough yet vulnerable, conflicted and amused, sincere and scared, without a hint of any of it on his sleeve.	A stylized, electric British crime thriller.
Nicholas Nickleby may be the only two-hour, 15-minute movie this year that feels like it's going by too fast.	Perhaps too much got boiled away. As it is, the plot contrivances are too obvious, if not preposterous, and the portrayal of evil seems remote for modern audiences.	To paraphrase a line from another Dickens' novel, Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato.	This may just be the funniest Dickens film ever mounted for the screen.	The project honors [Dickens'] passionate voice, and the strong ensemble cast sees us through a few tonal shifts.	Thanks to a strong cast of experienced actors and director Douglas McGrath's steady hand, Nicholas Nickleby is a worthy and respectful adaptation of the Dickens novel.
Throughout the movie Nicolas Cage wears a contorted facial expression that suggests the need for more fiber in his diet.	Slow action thriller from bored-looking Nic Cage.	Cage is believable as the brooding lone-wolf gunman, but the "hit man screwing himself by growing a conscience on his final kill" ploy needs to be put down for good.	[Cage takes] the big bucks to star in slovenly, inert pulp of the sort no actor of his magnitude should be stooping to.	As a Cage remake goes, it's never as terrible or inadvertently hilarious as The Wicker Man; but its functionality, over-familiarity and misguided morality makes it more Bangkok Dubious.	With murky cinematography, a meandering pace, a dull storyline, and rather wooden performances, The Pang Brothers' Hollywood remake of Bangkok Dangerous is unsuccessful.
The biggest surprise is the humour. With David Gulpilil's often irreverent and occasional mischievous narration, the dialogue is revealing and at times hilarious. We are taken into a world that we have never seen before.	Australian director Rolf de Heer deftly mingles two styles of storytelling: cinema and aboriginal oral customs.	The first feature in an Australian Aboriginal language feels authentic to the core as it tells a cautionary tale set 1,000 years ago.	One of the best films of the year and what will become an ageless standard in preserving and depicting aborigine culture and the tragicomedy of the human race.	Parts of that narrative are surprisingly frank and irreverent.	Ten Canoes combines adventure, comedy, and anthropology to explore an Aborigine folk tale both fallibly human and legendary. Helmer Rolf de Heer depicts a barely represented oral tradition with a clean style.
A great film, and a major leap forward in the career of Sam Raimi.	A surprisingly effective piece of work.	A very special and uncompromising piece of work. Wrap up warm.	Raimi takes the old story about dishonour among thieves and renders it fresh through the calm, cool, steady assurance of the telling.	It's been done before, and Raimi doesn't do it much differently or put his own stamp on it.	A riveting crime thriller full of emotional tension.
A crackerjack B-movie.	The only performance that kind of works is the one from Chiwetel Ejiofor as the central bad guy.	Most distressing, however, isn't the movie's high tide of bogus gangsta posturing, but its genuinely idiotic and irresponsible glorification of precisely the attitudes that Boyz n the Hood once depicted as vapid, self-replicating and suicidal.	The film seems to be intentionally C-grade, reveling in its TV-cop-show expository dialogue, cartoonish violence and 1970s soul songs that fit scenes a bit too snugly.	It's rare that you catch an acclaimed mainstream filmmaker dropping all pretenses and giving in to the desire to make pure pulp.	Despite striking a believable rapport among its principal actors, Four Brothers overwhelms with ultra-violent, vigilante-glorifying action and devolves into too many fractured, insubstantial thematic directions.
Winterbottom captures the spirit of the times, although the film's camera shakes and psychedelic colour bursts may make many viewers feel like reaching for Gravol rather than Ecstasy.	The film went on for too long, delivered very little substance, offered zero interesting characters and ultimately just bored the crap out of me.	There's nothing quite as amusing as watching the rise and fall of an arrogant prick who's both delusional and visionary.	Amazing, rich in authentic period atmosphere and detail, an ever-changing cyclorama of a movie that contains and frames Wilson, who never is allowed to overwhelm it.	The Manchester creation myth is thrillingly re-enacted.	The colorful, chaotic 24 Hour Party People nimbly captures the spirit of the Manchester music scene.
The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) is producer Samuel Goldwyn's classic, significant American film about the difficult adjustments of veterans	I found it notable mainly because its massive 172 minutes are exclusively devoted to exploring characters, rather than showing any giant-sized, dazzling "epic" scenes.	William Wyler's heartbreaking postwar ballad seems even more radical today than it did in its Oscar-thick heyday. It's as non-propagandistic as an unemployment line.	[A] powerful, if cumbersome prestige picture.	One of the few films that deserved all the awards heaped on it from the Oscars.	An engrossing look at the triumphs and travails of war veterans, The Best Years of Our Lives is concerned specifically with the aftermath of World War II, but its messages speak to the overall American experience.
Edgerton is unsettling you every moment that he's on and off screen.	"The Gift" is a movie full of surprises - and one of them is that it is surprisingly good.	"The Gift" is a low-budget, high-reward thriller and a confident first feature from a talented filmmaker.	The Gift may not be a true revelation, but it is an effective and workmanlike thriller	Edgerton's talent as an actor has been evident for a while, but The Gift announces him as a genuine triple threat.	The Gift is wickedly smart and playfully subversive, challenging the audience's expectations while leaving them leaning on the edges of their seats.
Tomorrowland isn't terrible but, given its potential to be great, I left the cinema feeling rather sad.	Despite a first hour that sometimes seems as if the movie itself will never arrive anywhere, hold on. The future is bright.	Is anything more dispiriting than a failed attempt at inspiration?	The movie leaves a bunch of questions unanswered but rockets ahead in such entertaining style that I scarcely minded.	Tomorrowland is an audacious, untidy work that wants us to be better and dream bigger. It's that rare summer blockbuster with something to say, and even if it stumbles over its words at times, we'd nonetheless be well advised to listen.	Ambitious and visually stunning, Tomorrowland is unfortunately weighted down by uneven storytelling.
At the midpoint... it got more and more confined, claustrophobic and flatter.	[The filmmakers] should go back and revisit the original film to discover what made it good in the first place.	Predators reboot a pleasant, gory surprise.	Predators is good if gory grindhouse fun. It tweaks the conventions of the summer monster movie, even as it observes them.	Brody does his best Clint Eastwood/Snake Plissken impression (yes, there is such a thing as good miscasting), but he knows what kind of movie he's in; watch him practice his "tough guy" faces even when he's in the background of a shot.	After a string of subpar sequels, this bloody, action-packed reboot takes the Predator franchise back to its testosterone-fueled roots.
It's as alive, as unpredictable, and certainly as devoid of cliches as few movies I've seen in quite a while.	Every movement [Gosling] makes comes from the same reservoir of dwindling faith and rising shame, so steady that you can practically see the cracks in Dan starting to spread.	Half Nelson offers an opportunity to marvel, once again, at the dazzling talent of Ryan Gosling for playing young men as believable as they are psychologically trip-wired.	An After School Special done up in gritty indie style.	Half Nelson gives the musty theme a full twist, and what emerges seems remarkably fresh. And yet mature too.	Half Nelson features powerful performances from Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps. It's a wise, unsentimental portrait of lonely people at the crossroads.
A compelling and compassionate portrait of a survivor.	Herzog proves that realism can be more thrilling than most cinematic gimmicks.	...a finely crafted work that benefits from the vision and talent of Werner Herzog.	This gritty tale pulls no punches in its depiction of a brutal prison in Laos and the even worse conditions outside prison in the jungle.	Herzog shows all of this with a fresh, observant eye. While sadism is a staple of most POW movies, Herzog focuses on the punishing tedium and deprivation of confinement. And filming on location in Thailand gives the film a harshly sensual look.	Director Werner Herzog has once again made a compelling tale of man versus nature, and Christian Bale completely immerses himself in the role of fighter pilot (and prisoner of war) Dieter Dengler.
Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman is ultimately so entertaining, with its oddball mixture of tongue-in-cheek humor and exciting fight sequences, that you're more than willing to overlook its flaws.	I'd call Zatoichi stylish to the point of distraction, except I'm not sure what I was being distracted from.	...Kitano concludes the film in such a way that one almost forgets the tedium that came before it (almost, but not quite).	Despite its period setting, it's a return to the combination of slapstick humor, dramatic intrigue, and sudden bloodshed that distinguished his early efforts. In other words, it's vintage Kitano.	Overlong, underpopulated and essentially pointless.	Colorful, rich with action and wonderfully choreographed, Takeshi Kitano takes on the classic samurai character with his own brand of cinematic flair.
Ironically, the problem with 'Daredevil' is that it takes absolutely no risks...even when you're watching it for the first time, it feels like a movie you've already seen.	This Daredevil doesn't take any risks.	Cut so frantically you'd think the studio chiefs were holding a pistol to the editor's head, Daredevil's 96 minutes feel compressed, rushed, and jumbled.	Daredevil isn’t a masterpiece, but ... it’s worth a trip to the local multi-plex.	It's pretty hollow at its core -- even for a comic book.	While Ben Affleck fits the role and the story is sporadically interesting, Daredevil is ultimately a dull, brooding origin story that fails to bring anything new to the genre.
Waters finds it nearly impossible to generate stimulation from a lovey-dovey narrative formula so lifeless it wouldn't register on any ER equipment.	With apologies to The Cure... 'Show me show me show me/ How you make a flick/ That has a hackneyed theme,' she said.	A film without the ghost of originality.	Given the positive crowd response to Just Like Heaven, it's hard to beat up on it too much, but it's the least of Waters' films	A gender-reversed variant of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir for a new generation.	Delightfully sweet like a lollipop, Just Like Heaven is a dreamy romantic comedy that may give you a toothache when it attempts to broach difficult end of life issues by throwing a cherry on top.
Ray turns out to be a proudly conventional film that combines an involving true story, irresistible music and a charismatic performance in a way that makes us not only forgive but actually almost relish how standard the presentation is.	Jamie Foxx is incredible as musical giant Ray Charles.	'Jamie Foxx brinda una de esas interpretaciones que, aunque suene a cliché, quedan para la historia'	... so suffused with clichéd mock-eventfulness and insipid veneration that you'd think [director Taylor] Hackford might be nominating [Ray Charles] for sainthood.	It's good that Hackford and company have allowed themselves to touch so many bases in Charles's biography.	An engrossing and energetic portrait of a great musician's achievements and foibles, Ray is anchored by Jamie Foxx's stunning performance as Ray Charles.
The drama effectively combines combat and potboiler courtroom drama.	Rules of Engagement avoids most of the typical courtroom pitfalls.	At their best, [Jackson and Jones] are merely two of the most cunning, commanding performers in all of movies.	Tense but shallow military drama heavy on violence, language	Whereas a TV version of the same material might flounder, this slick, big-budget film works because there is legitimate doubt as to both the level of guilt of the accused and the outcome of the trial.	The script is unconvincing and the courtroom action is unegaging.
Obviously aimed at an international audience, the film evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating.	The world the characters inhabit is less expressionist than impressionist, blessed with a delicate evocation of natural light and color that subtly incorporates Miyazaki's environmentalism.	The lack of sentimentality will be utterly refreshing to those raised on a diet of Disney.	A classic children's film from the master of Japanese animation.	Despite the cuteness, there's little in the way of icky sentiment - indeed the spectre of death hangs over the story - but it's a captivating world you won't want to come home from.	My Neighbor Totoro is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood.
[A] working class tragedy of mythic proportions, bristling with the inchoate rage of an underclass that . . . wouldn't know how to look up even if it knew that it could	...better than anything mainstream that I have seen all year.	At once a well spun story, a poignant and moving character study, and an indictment of contemporary society's indifference to the plight of the underprivileged.	The story is extremely powerful. This is a very depressing film, but also very well crafted.	The combination of its casual violence, its street sense and a loose cinematography makes the film feel like a documentary.	A bleak, but heartbreaking coming-of-age tale that resonates with truth.
Landmark Paul Newman vehicle--only took the Academy 25 years to recognize the greatness of his original "Fast Eddie" character	A Streetcar Named Desire for the con man.	Under Robert Rossen's strong direction, its ruthless and odorous account of one young hustler's eventual emancipation is positive and alive.	One of the most compelling character-based films to emerge from the decade of the 1960s.	A rich paean to the low-life pool players, dank pool halls and its pool sharks.	Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason give iconic performances in this dark, morally complex tale of redemption.
The chemistry between Matthau and O'Neal makes it work.	Bad News Bears is one of those rare films that I loved as a child and I still love just as much as an adult.	Isn't it great when a piece of classical music gets forever redefined by a movie about a bunch of foul mouthed brats? What could be a better way to spend 102 minutes of the truth?	This charming, funny film takes a gentle poke at Little League baseball and the American obsession with winning.	A small winner.	The Bad News Bears is rude, profane, and cynical, but shot through with honest, unforced humor, and held together by a deft, understated performance from Walter Matthau.
The Crash Reel is an intelligent, exciting and compassionate film... and Kevin Pearce a remarkable personality.	Operating on several levels, this engaging documentary holds our attention with eye-opening information and pulse-quickening action, but what makes it unmissable is its emotional kick.	The Crash Reel is an atypical sports movie. It's about placing your ambition on the back burner, about winning through giving up.	This compassionate account of the thrills and risks of extreme sports makes it required viewing for both aspirants and enthusiasts.	The Crash Reel is too smart a film to present any easy answers, but while Walker is careful to record the prices paid by Pearce...she doesn't pretend not to understand the impulse to push everything to the edge.	Smart, compassionate, and moving, The Crash Reel uses the familiar sport-doc formula to subvert expectations and ask challenging questions about ambition and achievement.
While that makes for an intriguing experiment, the results are at times befuddling -- and, even more often, underwhelming.	Thrilling euro-western with a darkly comic twist.	The film is too artsy for its own good, but it has some marvelous Coen Brothers-style black humor.	The feature-film debut for UK director John Maclean, Slow West is a strange beast that looks like the Coen brothers and Wes Anderson teamed up to shoot alternating scenes.	Brisk at 80ish minutes, Maclean's movie feels like a folk song, and features fine work from the cast, especially Fassbender.	Slow West serves as an impressive calling card for first-time writer-director John M. Maclean -- and offers an inventive treat for fans of the Western.
It's art, not fun, be warned. Actually, it has to be said the portrait it so fondly gives of life in Leeds is repellent: drunken, abusive, indolent, violent, and just ugly in every possible respect.	Tyrannosaur is a fearsome debut but it's subtler than the title suggests - and the film's uplifting moments make it easier to recommend than the average British misery flick.	A searing drama buoyed by exquisite performances and a keen understanding from its first-time director of the power of the absence of dialog.	A relentlessly-grim yarn revolving around a tragically-flawed trio being slowly swallowed whole by the emotional quicksand of a blue-collar wasteland where there really aren't any winners.	[H]arrowing [and] difficult to watch -- films about violent men should be harrowing and difficult, not slam-bang entertaining...	Tyrannosaur is a brutal, frank, and ultimately rewarding story of violent men seeking far-off redemption.
No movie called 'Leviathan' that's not about a sea alien eating Daniel Stern (or about fish) should be this nimble.	Director Andrey Zvyagintsev puts contemporary Russia, as up-to-the-minute as Putin and Pussy Riot, under the microscope. Leviathan is a stupendous piece of work that transcends language and borders.	A devasating film as starkly beautiful as its setting.	Leviathan is another downer, but it's considerably looser and livelier than its predecessors, verging at times on black comedy.	Politically charged and viscerally moving, Leviathan is a powerful film that challenges viewers to think about the injustices in the world that evade our tunnel vision.	Leviathan lives up to its title, offering trenchant, well-crafted social satire on a suitably grand scale.
A modestly fun exercise in predictability thanks to a cast that appears to relish playing cardboard cutouts.	There's something to be said for a cookie-cutter genre flick that delivers its payload with a minimum of obnoxiousness.	Good science fiction awakens a sense of awe, and even mediocre sci-fi sometimes manages wonder. But The Core does neither.	There's a marked absence of panic in The Core.	The only pressing burden in this deep interior world is the question: What in or on Earth is a cast this good doing in a movie this ridiculous?	A B-movie with its tongue planted firmly in cheek, The Core is so unintentionally (intentionally?) bad that it's a hoot.
Affleck's meta-satire riffs amusingly on celebrity culture without hitting too many faux-doc highs.	...does for the celebrity crash-and-burn story what This Is Spinal Tap did for rock docs. Except Spinal Tap only toured as a real band after the movie.	[It] may or may not be a put-on. If it is, it's done with a visceral edge that is as difficult to watch as it is morbidly fascinating	An ugly and disturbing deconstruction of self-destruction and emptiness.	Real documentary or hoax it's pathetic; there are definitely only losers here, in the film, behind the camera, and in the audience.	As unkempt and inscrutable as Joaquin Phoenix himself, I'm Still Here raises some interesting questions about its subject, as well as the nature of celebrity, but it fails to answer many of them convincingly.
Who would have thought? The Hangover is a crude, crass comedy that manages to be smart at the same time - oh, and funny as hell.	I highly recommend going into this film blind, just to keep some of the surprises from being ruined. Oh, and being a 21-year-old male will also really help you to enjoy this flick.	Phillips, with a script credited to Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (and with loads of loose-limbed interpretations from the cast), captures the amity among a group of grown men set loose without spouses, girlfriends, or sobriety to hinder them. (Or help.)	It's a non-stop laugh riot that's destined to become a comedy classic.	I can definitely understand why it was a humongous hit, but when all is said and done, once was enough for this partier...	With a clever script and hilarious interplay among the cast, The Hangover nails just the right tone of raunchy humor, and the non-stop laughs overshadow any flaw.
Driving Miss Daisy makes the simple point that combating racism can sometimes mean confronting a part of ourselves that we'd rather pretend does not exist. For Miss Daisy, it's as simple as admitting that Hoke is not just her driver, but her best friend.	This is a story about people, not politics. And perhaps because we can see the actors in closeup on the screen, that is even truer of the movie than the play.	The movie never resorts to sentimentality. It has a dry wit as well as genuine warmth. Best of all it is the perfect showcase for two deserving actors -- Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman.	For Tandy, it's her most substantial film role since her sublime work in Alfred Hitchcock`s 1963 The Birds, and she takes full advantage of it; never playing for sympathy, she earns it completely.	One of today's best movies	Warm and smartly paced, and boasting impeccable performances from Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy.
Clever, often hilarious.	A dark and often unattractive movie.	I thought Brooks mailed this script in.	The Muse is an underdeveloped, lackluster effort, despite a sparkling comic turn by Sharon Stone.	There are lots of punchy lines, but the one-joke movie doesn't have all that much to say.	Despite quirky and original writing, the subject matter feels too removed to produce laughs.
The best Bond yet.	There's little to link this thrilling action flick with the clichéd redundancy that the 007 movies had become.	Daniel Craig is all THAT and a bag of chips. Kudos to the new Bond regime.	Daniel Craig is a fair-haired, bare-knuckle antidote to Pierce Brosnan. On the action-adventure level, it hits the bulls-eye.	Of course, we don't really go to Bond movies for the dialogue and the romance. We go for the action, and on that front Casino Royale delivers -- if, like everything else about the picture, in a refreshingly downsized way.	Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.
an emotional roller-coaster ride that you won't be able to shake for days afterwards	Overwhelmingly sad, honest, creepy and ultimately hopeful.	If this really did unfold as the filmmakers claim, then the story is indeed sad and provocative, but its reputation has preceded it and aware audiences will expect something about what like happens.	The film's freewheeling strangeness leaves the viewer unable to decide if it is truthful or exploitative, genuine or faked.	...an enthralling documentary about loneliness, deception and that place where the two often meet: Facebook.	Catfish may tread the line between real-life drama and crass exploitation a little too unsteadily for some viewers' tastes, but its timely premise and tightly wound mystery make for a gripping documentary.
Food for thought for anyone who digs on existential narrative and adult, mannered, stylized, well-acted character pieces.	Does make you think, but it doesn't entertain.	Watching this film is not easy, but it is rewarding and thought provoking.	Will no doubt figure prominently in the awards season. But be warned, you can cut the gloom with a knife.	Like The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Hours is one of those reputedly "unfilmable" novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right.	The movie may be a downer, but it packs an emotional wallop. Some fine acting on display here.
An uncomfortable intermingling of message movie and gross-out comedy, a sporadically funny vehicle that indicts its audience for laughing. Come on, guys. You can't have your fun and eat it too.	Plays it safe, humanizing the real athletes just enough so as not to be offensive, but going just far enough with the offending material as to be entirely unfunny.	A good-natured comedy that isn't particularly interesting or, for that matter, very funny.	There's something about a movie deft enough to have fun with mental disability, yet still get a stamp of approval from the Special Olympics.	Predictable and unconvincing as romantic comedy, the movie is surprisingly sweet and funny whenever Steve is hanging out with his fellow Special Olympics players.	Despite a few laughs and good intentions, The Ringer is too predictable to really score the points it aims for.
I was hoping this production would inject some urgency and empathy into the rather oppressive tale. Unfortunately, it does not.	Macbeth has been previously well served by Roman Polanski and Akira Kurosawa but Kurzel has fashioned a pared-down success of his own.	It is effective in its own dour way and some of the set-pieces are magnificent but, watching it, you feel as if you are being pummelled.	This ferocious, masterful interpretation of the Scottish play lets rip with an onslaught of visual and emotional bravado, setting its story of ruthless ambition and spilt blood amid billowing smoke and red, raging fire.	Drenched in darkness and illuminated by hellfire, Macbeth is a grand yet grizzly story of power, violence and madness.	Faithful to the source material without sacrificing its own cinematic flair, Justin Kurzel's Macbeth rises on the strength of a mesmerizing Michael Fassbender performance to join the upper echelon of big-screen Shakespeare adaptations.
There is a potent national epic struggling to find expression here, but this movie is too rushed and fragmented to do it justice.	A ride that doesn't take us far enough.	If Ned Kelly is supposed to be an anti-hero to root for, his speeches border on parody and his cause is really unclear.	Ledger, talking into his chest for much of the film in an apparent effort to lend gravity to his performance, is pretty stiff, but so is Jordan's direction.	Offers a couple of well-filmed showdowns and lots of pretty landscapes, but you need more than scenic views and stylish action to chronicle a life, especially one as controversial as Kelly's.	More depth about the legendary outlaw would be welcome, but as it is, Ned Kelly is a reasonably entertaining Western.
Lars and the Real Girl proves love is blind - and it can be inanimate as well.	Lars and the Real Girl is a tenderly observed and affecting Capra-esque fable that is well-acted and gently funny.	Lars and the Real Girl is poised on the line between earnestness and farce.	Lars and the Real Girl is an SNL sketch reconfigured as quirky-corny Sundance pap.	The cast of Gosling, Schneider, Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson as Lars' doctor is more perfect than anything you can order on the Internet.	Lars and the Real Girl could've so easily been a one-joke movie. But the talented cast, a great script, and direction never condescends to its character or the audience.
British funny man Simon Pegg continues his downwards spiral with this lame, "'Devil Wears Prada"-styled "comedy."	Hollywood took a mediocre script and hired Pegg, relying on his charms alone to carry the picture. Sorry, it just doesn't work that way. The movie has to be good too.	Many critics will make some quip on the film's title doing precisely that to the audience looking for a little inside baseball, but there's so much general familiarity going for it already, why add to it?	Fluffed satirical targets, a shortfall of required rom-com charm, cheap gags and a thoroughly unpleasant 'hero' situate How To Lose Friends several floors below the desired Apartment-esque heights.	Too often, though, director Robert Weide resorts to the horribly hackneyed gag.	A decent performance from Pegg in a disappointing film. Neither sharp nor satirical, Weide's adaptation relies too heavily on slapstick, and misses the point of the source material in the process.
What distinguishes Flawless from other movies of the kind, unfortunately, is its absence of humor.	Though the central mystery does hold one's interest, tin-eared dialogue, unlikely staging and dramatic conveniences all work against our being swept up in the chicanery.	If ever a film title begged to be abused, this is it.	Flawless is a fictional tale, but something in director Michael Radford's conscientious, methodical presentation gives it the feeling of true history. Watching it is like watching a historical dramatization of something that never really happened.	Yet for all the imperfections, Flawless is a film you find yourself rooting for. Heists involving a keen sense of history are pleasant to stumble across.	Michael Caine's excellent performance makes Flawless something more than an average heist movie.
The comedic bits fall flat - but the action sequences are quite outlandish.	Despite some frustrating flaws, the thrills, spills and laughs are there.	Proves that throwing everything at the camera sometimes works a treat.	An old-fashioned, high-tech, fun time at the movies.	Good action sequences marred by a mean-spirited, misanthropic tone.	If it doesn't reach the heights of director James Cameron's and star Arnold Schwarzenegger's previous collaborations, True Lies still packs enough action and humor into its sometimes absurd plot to entertain.
The immersive power of the entire trilogy carries the day; if you go to the movies to be transported to another time and place--even if that time and place is '70s-era Yorkshire--the Red Riding films offer that escape.	This is a hugely ambitious piece of work that packs a cumulative wallop when it's all over.	One leaves this long but fascinating series appalled at the level of depravity one tiny corner of the globe can hold, but strangely exhilarated--as well as moved--by the craft and cunning with which it's been portrayed.	Thematically adventurous...the bloody shocks that paint the town Red emerge from suburban squalor: dirty streets, dirty crimes, and dirty politicians. [Blu-ray]	The films are complex, long-form storytelling, requiring you to observe, recall and interpret as the story bleeds through three movie-length episodes.	This crime drama features great performances and the three directors make the setting -- 1970s and 1980s Yorkshire -- an immersive, gritty, and dangerous place.
Suck it, Avatar.	"Jackass 3D gives fans exactly what they want from Knoxville and his crew: an outrageous, gross and raucous good time."	The real quibble with the film is that while a few stunts raise some decent laughs, too much of Jackass 3D relies on grossness for its own sake, which can become a tad tedious	Jackass 3-D is powered by a shamelessly regressive but infectious adolescent prankishness.	The boys often wear helmets for their stunts, evidently believing their heads contain something worth protecting.	The Jackass gang might be running out of gross-out stunts, but this installment contains plenty of brilliantly brain-dead comedy -- and the 3-D adds a pungent new dimension.
Undoubtedly one of the most romantic movies of all time...	Agreeably alluring.	There's a vulnerable undercurrent beneath this film, one that beats and throbs with the stolen looks, brief touches and romantic under-the-stars kisses.	the film asks us to consider the very nature and purpose of our existence in a fragmentary, superficial and transient universe.	Acting tour de force that feels exceptionally real	Thought-provoking and beautifully filmed, Before Sunrise is an intelligent, unabashedly romantic look at modern love, led by marvelously natural performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.
For an Oscar-baiting movie, Milk doesn't beg for attention, but it certainly earns it.	Van Sant's skill as a film-maker is showcased here to inspiring effect. Rarely has a lesson in political history felt so involving and alive. What's more, it's a genuinely important film that could not be better timed.	Giving himself utterly to the role, Penn takes an actor's craft and dedication to soulful heights, making a demand for dignity that becomes universal.	The sweetness and thrill of a heady new sense of possibilities in the pre-AIDS era is almost unbearably poignant.	Van Sant makes sure Milk's flaws are also shown, as details his ultimately inspirational and tragic story.	Anchored by Sean Penn's powerhouse performance, Milk is a triumphant account of America's first openly gay man elected to public office.
A thriller that actually thrills.	The [movie's] visual signature ... is the sight of a bullet wound in the head - which, one imagines, might feel similar to the head-pounding felt after watching [it].	The cheese factor is satisfying and the no-frills approach has a gut-level appeal.	It's a surprisingly tough and unrelenting action picture.	At its best, though, this is witty, tense and bloody: a homage that Carpenter might appreciate.	This remake has been praised by some as an expertly made B-movie, and dismissed by others as formulaic.
feels like it should have always been in 3-D.	A timeless (and often headless) classic.	This brilliant combination of stop-motion animation, three-dimensional sets and superbly imaginative graphics, brings animation to new peaks.	A well-realized and weirdly amusing animated treat.	A fun house of funereal glamour.	The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.
A hastily-edited-to-a-PG-13 werewolf movie, with acting so dreadful it makes Troll 2 look like a Mercury Theater production.	Admittedly, there's something about a bunch of hot-looking Goth-type vampires on motorcycles that has, well, a little bite to it.	A thoroughly undistinguished addition to a genre that probably reached its peak a quarter-century ago with An American Werewolf in London.	A werewolf movie so bad it merits a silver bullet.	One of the year's more pleasant surprises.	Skinwalkers is an atrociously-acted project whose unoriginal and ineptly-staged action sequences remind viewers of far better werewolf and action movies.
Scare-wise, the film had potential, but it used very cookie-cutter traits to approach it.	At least the Blair Witch kids knew how to hold the camera steady.	A straight-up, seen-it-all-before found footage terror feature starring a bunch of untested actors, directed by two men who have no interest in disrupting audience expectations.	The Gallows has a cleverness that bobs, occasionally, above the surface of cesspool murk. You can't tell whether it's just flotsam or a corpse, but for most of the 80-minute run time it almost doesn't matter. It's at least something.	There are plenty of jump scares which might satisfy the Friday night crowd, but if you're a genre fan looking for a pleasant surprise, you won't find one here.	Narratively contrived and visually a mess, The Gallows sends viewers on a shaky tumble to the bottom of the found-footage horror barrel.
Just when you think Haneke will slip away under the cloak of total obfuscation, he hits us with a long, final mega-shot.	There's a sense that Hitchcock is hovering in the background and cheering for Auteuil, who musters all his French superstardom to play a man having his mask of blandness torn off.	... a brilliantly sinister mystery fraught with guilt, deceit and denial.	Thrillers often betray their audiences in order to entertain them. In "Cache," it's the footage itself that betrays us.	Writer-director Michael Haneke's unnerving new mystery Cache (Hidden) worms its way into your brain and doesn't leave for days.	A creepy French psychological thriller that commands the audience's attention throughout.
[Hartnett's and Jackson's] scenes are underscored with some memorably good writing.	Everything is about winning respect versus earning it. This film earned mine. I'm glad I took a chance on it. By the look of my theater, not many others did.	As the film descends into its big life-changing final scenes and unresolved family issues, things turn soggy; it's a movie with a glass jaw.	Subtlety is knocked on its ass and put out for the count, though a chilling sense of white self-entitlement and ethical superiority tingles on.	Ultimately, the film fails because it never answers the question of why anyone should care about this guy who cares so little about himself that he lands himself in trouble in the first place.	While sluggish in spots, Resurrecting the Champ is a sports/newsroom drama elevated by high-caliber performances by Samuel Jackson, Josh Hartnet, and Alan Alda.
It's a quiet, contemplative film that reminded me of Mike Nichols' Closer, with too many shots of lighting cigarettes and looking pensive in train windows, but I liked it.	The actors try their best to transcend the flimsy script and unappealing direction, but ultimately the movie offers a mostly hollow experience that delivers a night that you will struggle to remember.	He's withheld and she's, frankly, grating. So we don't really care if they weather the current storm, because sooner or later they're bound to get divorced, anyway.	Will Michael succumb and prove Joanna correct in her suspicions? Will Alex's French accent conquer all? Do you care? I didn't.	It's hard to care about the fate of a marriage that never quite comes into focus.	Last Night doesn't opt for easy answers, but the framework and characters overall are too slight and plain to be compelling.
The picture has a tone - smart and slashingly sarcastic - that's all its own. It's actually kind of brilliant.	Feeling awfully long for a short movie, two-dimensional characters and spotty editing fail to capitalize on a clever idea.	With women calling the shots on this production, I'm sure we're supposed to think this is empowerment, but I'm not sure this is what feminism is really about.	Funny, sexy, cool and destined to become a cult classic.	Your better smelling garbage teen horror pic.	Jennifer's Body features occasionally clever dialogue but the horror/comic premise fails to be either funny or scary enough to satisfy.
Unlike the target of its scorn, Outfoxed does not attempt to hide its bias.	The entertaining "Outfoxed" comes to the ourageous conclusion that Fox News is not fair and balanced. Gosh, who knew?	Outfoxed is effective at undermining the no-news-all-screaming FOX News Channel and giving it a taste of its own medicine.	Unlike Michael Moore, Greenwald does not interject himself. Instead, he hangs Fox News with its own words.	An often grave but sometimes hilarious picture of a hugely powerful network.	Neither fair nor balanced itself, Outfoxed offers an often entertaining indictment of the Fox News Channel.
A cliched and predictable script mixed with the miscasting of Jaden Smith make The Karate Kid a pretty dull film. Stick with the original.	There's only one area in which the film doesn't appear to be pandering to its perceived audience of impatient 10-year-olds, and that's its runtime.	Jaden Smith is the perfect mix of cockiness and vulnerability and, taking after his old man Will, the kid can deliver the funnies too.	The action sequences, as expected with Chan, are amazing. These, along with a snappy pace, stunning locations and credible performances, counterbalance the film's overlong running time.	Smith might be the focus, but while he's got the charisma and the moves, it's Chan who makes it punch above its weight. Nice scenery too.	It may not be as powerful as the 1984 edition, but the 2010 Karate Kid delivers a surprisingly satisfying update on the original.
The more weight the story of Maggie and Jamie takes on, the more distracting is the screenplay's need to intercut updates on the pharmaceutical wars.	Edward Zwick successfully cloaks his critique of Big Pharma in the guise of a funny, sexy romantic comedy...until the third-act doldrums set in, that is.	There were several potential avenues to develop here, but the film settles for something conventional and sentimental with its love story.	I'm not saying this is a perfect film. It's not. But it is a daring, challenging piece, and deserves to be seriously considered for all of its strengths, as well as the weaknesses.	Love And Other Drugs gets wound up in a fascinating tangle of ill-advised romance and even more ill-advised pill-pushing gamesmanship. It's the untangling that's the problem.	It's a pleasure to see Hollywood produce a romance this refreshingly adult, but Love and Other Drugs struggles to find a balance between its disparate plot elements.
Morgen's strange, wonderful, audio-visual assault takes an icon and makes him all too human.	An often brilliant, sometimes overheated but always humane documentary, one in which Nirvana's music and fame is just the scaffolding to Cobain's inner life.	Montage of Heck is a fascinating look at the man who created music that still matters to so many people.	The annoying title notwithstanding, Cobain: Montage of Heck does a decent job of capturing the charisma and restless creativity of Nirvana's frontman Kurt Cobain without getting bogged down in hagiography.	Doesn't just summarize his life. He gets in deep, digging up his passions and relevant works of art.	Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck makes a persuasive case for its subject without resorting to hagiography -- and includes plenty of rare and unreleased footage for fans.
Not even half a year since Baumbach's gem The Squid and the Whale, another film has emerged conveying similar themes of domestic discomfort and disenchantment.	Eimbcke attempts to give this story a melancholy overlay, but its main interest is in its confirmation that teenagers are pretty much the same everywhere.	Sometimes it is amusing, but mostly it is boring and icky.	Lovingly cast, suavely directed and always pitched perfectly, whatever its tone, Duck Season is the kind of small, quiet, thoughtful movie that ought to be as abundant as Sunday afternoons.	I have one word for these kids: Monopoly.	This modest cinematic slice-of-life manages to subtly capture many small but resonant and truthful moments of adolescence.
The film lost me there (it seems much more likely he would simply have left the baby in the car), so what follows didn't work for me either. But if you can buy the premise, you may enjoy this film.	Un drama urbano duro y conmovedor, si bien algo previsible, con un estupendo protagonista. Una película realmente atendible que nos acerca al infrecuente cine sudafricano.	For all its dark edges, Tsotsi comes with a silver lining making it worthy of its squirmy ride.	Director Gavin Hood, along with cinematographer Lance Gower, bring us another exquisite and meaningful film.	The details of township life, in all their violence and quotidian drudgery and bursts of lost child playfulness, ring persuasively true.	Chweneyagae's powerful performance carries this simple yet searing tale of a shantytown teenager's redemption.
Bombarded by cliché, you wilt in your seat like a discarded rose.	A bonafide romantic comedy for the OMG generation...	Valueless as entertainment, it's still useful as a disambiguation tool for those who confuse Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel, or Taylor Dayne and Taylor Swift.	A perfect date movie with more stars than script appeal... it's contrived and predictable, although there are a couple of surprises	Despite the best efforts of the players, the script is just flat.	Eager to please and stuffed with stars, Valentine's Day squanders its promise with a frantic, episodic plot and an abundance of rom-com cliches.
It's short, sweet, romantic, and leaves you wanting more.	introduces a number of very human characters that we grow to care about	Despite its seemingly thin skein and short running time, Yossi & Jagger emerges as a deeply felt, complex and non-stereotypical story.	A minor but affecting story of men caught between their personal desires and societal expectations... distinguished by sharp writing and nicely understated acting.	Remarkable for its economy and depth of feeling even as it skims along a plot that could have been formulaic, the film is both a window to another culture and a mirror on our own.	A tersely told yet deeply felt romance.
What Merchants of Doubt makes clearest is that these issues shouldn't be political.	There isn't a tremendous amount of new information in this generally well-crafted documentary. But it makes a potent, urgent case against the merchants of doubt who play games with the planet's future.	By the film's own implicit admission, those who most need to see 'Merchants of Doubt' are also the least likely to be swayed by its argument.	Merchants is full of incredibly telling interactions and visuals to help make its case.	When your objective is to get nothing done, you have a serious advantage. If honesty isn't a priority, things get even easier. This is the most impactful -- and the most depressing -- takeaway of Robert Kenner's documentary.	Merchants of Doubt is a thought-provoking documentary assembled with energy and style, even if it doesn't dig as deep as it could.
Harrison Ford isn't exactly the kind of guy you might envision as a computer expert, but then again he did make the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs	Another Hollywood movie that presents a 'typical' American family as ultra-privileged and glamorous.	No matter how accomplished the performers, it's difficult to make tapping on a keyboard and staring at computer screens exciting.	The plot of Firewall is about as complex as a game of Pong.	It runs along a time-worn path at a leisurely pace and holds few surprises.	Harrison Ford's rote performance brings little to this uninspired techno-heist film whose formulaic plot is befuddled with tedious and improbable twists.
Self-indulgent? To a point. But Jarmusch makes seductive work of it: the deep, dusty images, the hypnotic pacing.	Jarmusch understands that what's really relatable about vampires is the getting-old part: the sense, illusion or not, that as you get older, everyone younger than you is somehow stupid, crass, immature, and just not at all like you.	Trust Jarmusch to eschew cliché and think about the vampire condition.	This is Jim Jarmusch's dark and mournful version of Wim Wenders Wings of Desire ... immortals watching over a decaying city ... burdened by disappointment.	While Jarmusch's vision is an original take on the genre, it's also hard to fully engage with his efforts, the pace too stately, the script too self-conscious, and the initially intriguing characters ultimately outstaying their welcome.	Worth watching for Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton's performances alone, Only Lovers Left Alive finds writer-director Jim Jarmusch adding a typically offbeat entry to the vampire genre.
Soderbergh fans will rejoice. The rest of the world will scratch its collective head.	The crimer suffers from a slim, underdeveloped script by Lem Dobbs (who also write Kafka), but benefits from Soderbergh's astute direction that posits two 1960s cinematic icons, Brit Terrence Stamp and American Peter Fonda as long-time enemies.	I was distracted to the point of contention at several points in The Limey by cinematic technique. I must write that Stamp's mesmerizing performance eventually drew me back in, every time.	A tart and juicy genre aperitif.	The movie belongs to Stamp and Fonda.	Crafted with eccentric moodiness and style by Steven Soderbergh, The Limey is also a gritty neo-noir showcase for the talent of leading man Terence Stamp.
In the aggregate, though, it's a fractious Christmas spent with unpleasant relatives you'd rather avoid.	Clumsy, well-meaning, and almost rescued by the amazing Diane Keaton.	In the spirit of the holiday family saga, I cry, Uncle.	There are many ways to define the shrieking awfulness of The Family Stone, from the general lack of wit to the cheap exploitation of cancer to its casual cruelty.	A smart, tart but mildly undercooked Christmas pudding.	This family holiday dramedy features fine performances but awkward shifts of tone.
...a disappointingly by-the-numbers drama that rarely lives up to the effectiveness of its performances.	It's certainly a moving film, and many will find its close examination of a father-son relationship particularly cathartic and reflective.	Though ... well-acted by Firth, Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson, the slow pacing makes it feel as if everyone is walking through a waist-deep bog of emotional reserve.	When it comes down to it, the story of a son who needs validation and his dying father is utterly predictable.	The source is Blake Morrison's memoir of the same title, an impressionistic account that the filmmakers -- director Anand Tucker with screenwriter David Nichols -- have cast impeccably and, without losing the nuance, shaped into a strong narrative arc.	Sensitive to a fault, Tucker's adaptation of the Morrison novel is nonetheless solidly scripted and well-acted; guard your heartstrings.
For all its charm, there's nothing in The Holiday you haven't seen in a dozen romantic comedies.	You'll find it hard to leave the theater not beaming.	The Holiday is a drippily sentimental and contrived movie that ladles on the treacle with a particularly heavy hand and strands some good actors -- and not so good ones -- along the way.	Might be considered a decent date movie... but only if guys were allowed to leave their testicles at home.	Sappy, sugary, star-driven, The Holiday is a confection right off the Hollywood assembly line.	The Holiday, while sweet and somewhat touching, lacks any surprises and eventually overstays its welcome.
Ten years on, we can finally call this film a classic. It's an unparalleled work of social and cultural study. The new, remastered cut means it looks better than ever.	A windfall for serious film fanatics, the documentary is a visually rich, highly personal and opinionated meditation on the role that Los Angeles has played in film history and in a multitude of features.	Arguably the best movie about movies ever made.	Smart, funny, stimulating.	What Andersen does best is capture the sense of growing up and living among the landmarks of Hollywood's authentic back lot.	A treat for cinephiles, this documentary is a comprehensive, academic, and enlightening film essay concerning Los Angeles and its depiction in the movies.
Quite funny for the type of movie it is...	You'll likely hate yourself for laughing, but laugh you will.	Had it not wandered into aforementioned eclair territory, it could have been better than a discount video rental.	Occasionally a joke hits its target, but that can be explained by the law of averages.	When you start giving National Lampoon movies a bad name, you must be doing something really wrong.	A derivative gross-out comedy that's short on laughs.
...high art as a refreshing summer spritzer.	This fast and loose independent production is enjoyable as a home movie, but not much more.	A joyous, utterly contemporary treatment of the Bard's 400-year old play. While the production's bare-bones budget shows at time, (the film) is clearly a labor of love on the part of all involved.	A creative blend of contemporary wit and love with Shakespearian vernacular.	I enjoyed Whedon's film both as a species of stunt and also as a legitimately entertaining entry in the voluminous Shakespeare adaptation sweepstakes.	Lighthearted to a fault, Much Ado About Nothing's giddy energy and intimate charm make for an entertaining romantic comedy -- and a Shakespearean adaptation that's hard to resist.
It's a provocative, challenging study in denial and one of its star's and its director's all-time bests.	A biopic about Crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video.	At times Auto Focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope. Yet in its own aloof, unreachable way it's fascinating.	A repetitive and disappointingly shallow look at what is in fact an intriguing Hollywood mystery.	The brave conduit of Schrader's doom-laden moralism is Greg Kinnear, giving one of those revelatory performances that makes everything an actor does prior seem like marking time.	Kinnear and Dafoe help make this downward spiral of one man's life a compelling watch.
With a nod and a wink to Sergio Leone, South Korean filmmaker Kim Jee-woon delivers a slam-bang western set in Manchuria after the Japanese invasion in 1931.	The Good, the Bad, the Weird is little more than a series of anonymous, elaborate shoot-outs. Like its title, it's just a goof.	Imagine the sparseness of classic oaters matched with the energy of martial arts movies and you've got what Kim Jee-won has wrought.	Imagine if Terry Gilliam decided to make a spaghetti western by substituting some Asian noodles and leftover beats from Quentin Tarantino and Takashi Miike	This is filmmaking as rodeo ride: bruising and ultimately pointless, but thrilling as hell while it lasts.	Whilst never taking itself too seriously, this riotous and rollicking Sergio Leone-inspired Korean Western is serious fun.
Polanski's best by a wide margin. The walls! The walls!	A fascinating if slow-moving study of the onset of madness.	It's been an inspiration ever since for films about claustrophobic hysteria, but not necessarily in a good way ...	Roman Polanski's1965 psychological thriller uncoils like a primordial poisonous snake disguised by unfathomable beauty that conceals its deadly feminine bite	Haunting and ominous from first frame to last, Polanski's first English film is a masterpiece, a subtle horror tale about the descent into madness of an isolated, sexually repressed woman, stunningly played by Catherine Deneuve who was only 22 at the time	Roman Polanski's first English film follows a schizophrenic woman's descent into madness, and makes the audience feel as claustrophobic as the character.
Funny enough.	Click to read review	Third time was not a charm for this winning franchise.	Wherever you are in the story, there's always something funny coming at you.	There are painfully few good gags here.	This overly silly third installment attempts to hit the same funny notes as the original, but falls flat overall.
Alex Proyas's pulp revenge fantasy, based on a comic-book saga by James O'Barr, is dark, moody, and seductively overwrought; it's an amazingly pure expression of morbid adolescent romanticism.	Totally dated, totally terrific. "Darker-than-thou" types should stay to listen to Jane over the end credits	A spectacular-looking new film that sets new standards for visual style.	Follows an entirely predictable path, but does so with style and intensity.	The movie's central value and its most melancholy tone -- Lee's star presence. It's amazing and it's tragic.	Filled with style and dark, lurid energy, The Crow is an action-packed visual feast that also has a soul in the performance of the late Brandon Lee.
Sitch deserves the highest praise for recapturing the global feeling of rapture and awe at watching a man walk on the moon. ... For a few minutes we can party like it's 1969.	A smiling human comedy.	A quietly engaging experience that skips down memory lane with bona fide sincerity.	Might just snap North American viewers out of the poop joke rut.	The cast is wonderful, the soundtrack features a well-chosen array of bouncy period pop tunes, and Graeme Wood's cinematography makes the most of the stately beauty of the dish itself.	A feel good movie without an abundance of mush.
It's a great ride.	The intelligent and clever script has enough humor to break the tension periodically.	The stalking struggle between reason and unreason that precedes it is much more gripping--and fun.	Unfortunately, as the film winds to a close, claustrophobic tension once again gives way to overblown digital effects and set pieces.	An exciting, entertaining variation of the Die Hard formula where our kick-*** hero is none other than the President of the United States.	This late-period Harrison Ford actioner is full of palpable, if not entirely seamless, thrills.
This movie is the glass in the soup, the big bad wolf under the bed.	Using the imagery of German Expressionism and the creepy techniques of David Lynch, Kent has created a psychological horror which gradually shifts the ground beneath our feet.	Intelligently presented creepy mood piece 'Old Dark House' horror thriller.	"Babadook" an Impressive Calling Card	We can't help but follow because we empathize with every character -- even the big black sharp-fingered monster that pops up from the dark depths of the subconscious to wreak havoc in the supposed safety of daylight.	The Babadook relies on real horror rather than cheap jump scares -- and boasts a heartfelt, genuinely moving story to boot.
While networks can no longer fire people for wedding a co-worker and the once-terrifying threat of Communism has long since evaporated, many of the other problems addressed in 'Good Night' are still startlingly relevant.	Dense, direct and digression-free.	Could actor-writer-director George Clooney's smart reenactment of the 50-year-old fracas between a courageous newsman and a paranoid, power-mad U.S. senator be the most politically relevant Hollywood film of 2005? It just might.	bez obzira na plemenite namjere svojih tvoraca, ipak ne zaslu%u017Euje "Oscara", jer je iznevjerio visoke standarde objektivnosti koje pripisuje svom junaku.	That it's a film both timely and timeless goes without saying. Yet Clooney is too canny a storyteller to let didacticism obscure the complexities of Murrow's character.	A passionate and concise cinematic civics lesson, Good Night, And Good Luck has plenty to say about today's political and cultural climate, and its ensemble cast is stellar.
Dial M remains more of a filmed play than a motion picture, unfortunately revealed as a conversation piece about murder which talks up much more suspense than it actually delivers.	Grace Kelly reaches out into the audience for murder scissors; foreground tea tables all but clonk your knees; a tell-tale door key - how many Hitchcock revelation moments feature those! - is brandished inches from your nose.	Was by far the most visually compelling of studio stereoscopic movies.	Milland's sinister sophistication catches the eye, but Kelly's subtly shaded suffering is superb.	A tightly wound psychological parlour game, expanded only slightly from its claustrophobic stage roots.	Dial M for Murder may be slightly off-peak Hitchcock, but by any other standard, it's a sophisticated, chillingly sinister thriller -- and one that boasts an unforgettable performance from Grace Kelly to boot.
Manages to capture the raw energy of the band.	What Scorsese captures is the outpouring of energy that can revitalize rock lovers en masse.	Shine A Light is pure rock'n'roll nirvana, standing mightily as one of the truly great concert films.	Scorsese captures the Stones at their ancient, un-ironic best, bluesy showmen who leave it all on the stage every night, never for a moment letting on that they're playing, for the 10,000th time, 40-year-old hits.	There is no such thing as a blank slate with such cultural icons -- too much informs our viewing experience -- and that's both one of the film's biggest strengths and weaknesses.	It may offer little new for fans, but Martin Scorsese's document of the Rolling Stones' electrifying live show should provide satisfaction to audiences.
The minor miracle of My Cousin Vinny is that--though the picture never scores any guffaws, the villains remain off-screen, and the conclusion is never in doubt--the movie's full two-hour running time passes so breezily. [Blu-ray]	[An] enjoyable fish-out-of-water comedy.	Big dumb comedy that somehow works.	It's the kind of movie home video was invented for: Not worth the trip to the theater, but slam it into the VCR and you get your rental's worth.	My Cousin Vinny is the definition of obvious, and it's way too long (do films like this really need an hour's worth of setup?). But Pesci and Tomei make a first-rate team.	The deft comic interplay between Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei helps to elevate My Cousin Vinny's predictable script, and the result is a sharp, hilarious courtroom comedy.
Influenced by Thelma & Louise and Waiting to Exhale, this well-crafted Girls N the Hood has social conscience and soul; Queen Latifah gives a career-making performance that should made her a big Hollywood star	Despite Gray's galvanic ability with action sequences, there are very few surprises to be found in Set It Off	One of the rare movies sporting great action sequences and a ring of truth.	Overlong, overdone and overwrought, the narratively challenged Set It Off gets off on exploitation shock and social-conscience schlock in equal measure.	Fierce and emotionally resonant action-drama, anchored by four smart performances.	It may not boast an original plot, but Set It Off is a satisfying, socially conscious heist film thanks largely to fine performances from its leads.
A great idea, good send off with bold intentions, that doesn't quite mature; that said, you probably won't be bored.	In the new film, it's personal tragedy that provokes the journey, not social upheaval or even scientific curiosity -- which, predictably, makes for a story that's at once more familiar and less interesting.	The usually charismatic Pearce, however, shows all the emotional range of a rock, making it all the harder to buy the moment in which his wispy prof charges unarmed after inhumanly strong beast-men rather than coming up with a superior-minded plan.	... Wells the director has created little more than a weak love story with some action thrown in to stop the movie-goers' time in the theatre from crawling.	The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine.' But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless.	This Machine has all the razzle-dazzles of modern special effects, but the movie takes a turn for the worst when it switches from a story about lost love to a confusing action-thriller.
By the time it's all over audiences may feel they've been had by a fiendishly manipulative storyteller. But then, being had is one of the reasons we go to the movies.	As transparent as this device is, Angels has elemental satisfactions in its blend of movie genre that could appeal to wide segments of the audience.	I get that saving the world from disaster is important business. But is it too much to ask for it to be fun for the audience?	This graceless and overwrought piece of storytelling will probably earn a Pope's ransom at the box office, despite its many flaws.	Right now in Florida, there is a slick-haired tele-evangelist claiming to be both the second coming of Christ and the Antichrist. He has his own church, a "666" tattoo and hundreds of thousands of adoring believers tuning in worldwide. In other words, the	Angels and Demons is a fast-paced thrill ride, and an improvement on the last Dan Brown adaptation, but the storyline too often wavers between implausible and ridiculous, and does not translate effectively to the big screen.
Lined with fetid chunks of Oscar bait like so many droppings in an untended stable	A rousing and heartwarming film, Diane Lane may get Disney the Best Actress Oscar.	Secretariat earns its best accolades for asking even larger questions as it highlights the story not just of a terrific horse but of his greatest champion, owner Penny Chenery, portrayed with grace, edge and a growing sense of self by Diane Lane.	Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment. What're the odds?	...oldstyle Hollywood, family entertainment done at a very high level. It doesn't lay out all the facts and complications, but it's a very honest movie.	Rousing, heartwarming, and squarely traditional, Secretariat offers exactly what you'd expect from an inspirational Disney drama -- no more, and no less.
Beneath the overreaching ambition (pretension?) lies a solidly entertaining creature feature of superior style--maybe not exactly the deep existential examination Scott and Lindelof were striving for, but no small feat all the same.	While it lacks Alien's ferocious simplicity and focus, Scott's determination to see his often loopy ideas through gives his film a single-minded vigour rarely found in pictures of this scale.	In space, no one can hear you having a good time.	Of all the revelations in Ridley Scott's Prometheus, perhaps the most astounding is that Scott doesn't understand his own work.	It's a striking composition that's burdened by frustrating unanswered questions that distract from the greater themes of faith and religion in science.	Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to Alien may not answer all of its big questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances -- particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android.
...pretty standard mean-girls stuff, made enjoyable by the deft casting of Bynes...	...should satisfy Bynes fans looking for a pleasant, innocuous follow-up to her last vehicle.	Despite a predictable and formulaic storyline, there are enough genuine laugh-inducing moments... that Sydney White is rarely boring if not exactly fresh or original.	Sydney White isn't incompetently made. It's not even particularly offensive. It's just very, very uninspired and almost instantly forgettable.	Whoever thought to merge "Snow White" with "Revenge of the Nerds" had a clever idea there. And you can watch it unfold in "Sydney White."	Amanda Bynes is charming, but Sydney White is a poorly adapted take on Snow White, relying on tired ethnic stereotypes laughs.
A classic comedy! Proves Mike Myers was funny once.	Mike Myers' first claim to fame. Funny.	Mike Myers got better later	Hilariously endearing.	Myers and Carvey cut it up on the rare Saturday Night Live skit that shines on the silver screen.	An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catch phrases, Wayne's World is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters.
You should skip the theatrical release and rent it -- don't buy it -- when it arrives on video, where it should have gone in the first place.	John Goodman's Baloo admits, 'King Louie? He split!' Before the third defibrillation of 'Bare Necessities,' you and your kids might too.	The music here, though at times toe-tapping, is uninspired.	As someone who enjoys an above-average cartoon ... I'm a little cheesed by the pro forma story line and ruthlessly brief running time of Book.	Rudyard Kipling, on whose book all this is based, managed to have his name taken off the credits from beyond the grave, proving that in death he has a savvier agent than those responsible for this script.	This inferior rehash of The Jungle Book should have gone straight to video.
Imagine Ordinary People with half its IQ deducted.	Sad movies can rock you when they are well-paced and believable, but if you ever laugh because they go too far, the emotional connection is lost.	...chisel away the superfluous, and there is a very fine movie here.	Family crosscurrents are so rarely explored with any kind of intelligence in commercial American filmmaking, one applauds Harris for going there at all.	An ambitious, uneven directorial debut.	Imaginary Heroes is a muddled, melodramatic and unconvincing drama.
A Lion King clone that's tailored to the Fisher-Price crowd.	Don't the filmmakers know there are children watching -- and listening?	...has energy to spare but a flimsy and only mildly amusing script that doesn't allow it to stand out from the current glut of kid-friendly CGI competitors.	There are far better ways of keeping the kids happy.	Forget the confusion of the he-cows that populate the film; the real problem is that Barnyard is just a lousy, lousy movie.	Unimaginative and unfunny, this tale of barnyard mischief borders on 'udder' creepiness and adds little to this summer's repertoire of animated films.
Well paced and perfect for moviegoers who want their minds occupied as well as their adrenal glands stimulated.	Let down by a tepid script, plodding direction and--amazingly, in view of the talent involved--indifferent acting; this isn't a winning 'Score.'	In a season of CG effects and thespians, the film's old-fashioned feel is not only refreshing but feels downright innovative.	The best pure heist movie in recent years.	DeNiro and Norton score while Brando simply sweats.	Though the movie treads familar ground in the heist/caper genre, DeNiro, Norton, and Brando make the movie worth watching.
Based on the, uh, classic kid's book, Fried Worms captures that feeling of spending a Saturday on a secret mission -- one that seems like the most important thing in the whole world -- until the next day, when you find another one.	...Isn't about or for anyone past puberty.	This is a delightfully snips and snails and puppy-dog tails-style movie, based on the book that has happily grossed out kids since 1973.	Unhealthy eating is paired with a wholesome message, as the story encourages youngsters to be themselves, keep their word and accept kids who are different.	This is a movie for kids in the 8-12 range who see it as something that reflects their own lives. You may not care about How to Eat Fried Worms, but your kids will.	This Fear Factor for kids is good-natured and tasty enough.
Encourages viewers of all ages to Dream: Bigger, Sweeter, Smarter.	Does an excellent job both making science fiction accessible for a younger audience.	The Last Mimzy, directed by New Line head honcho Bob Shaye, is very obviously aiming square at the ET target, which wouldn't be bad if Shaye had a clue what made ET work.	Classic kids' fantasy in the spirit of Flight of the Navigator and ET.	The gentleness of the film is almost unique in this day and age. It's a true family movie, one that adults likely won't groan at when they are told that the problems of the future are because 'our precious quality of humanity had been turned off.'	The Last Mimzy makes efforts to be a fun children's movie, but unsuccessfully juggles too many genres and subplots -- eventually settling as an unfocused, slightly dull affair.
It's an odd yet oddly engaging combination of horror, romance, and dark comedy, and it's certainly one of the most original genre films you'll see all year.	The protagonist of this low-budget indie is so well characterized that it might have developed into a straight drama instead of the horror movie it becomes, though of course that's the key to most good genre films.	Even a not-so-great ending can't overturn everything that came before it.	Every so often, a film comes along that takes so weird a turn that it completely discombobulates the viewer. Spring is such a film.	Starts as a downbeat beatdown of a bad luck drama, then blossoms into a European journey, a fraught romantic pursuit, a horror movie and, ultimately, a sweet, haunting enigma with layers of subtext.	Rich in atmosphere and intelligence, Spring is a singular horror film with a sneaky, lingering impact.
Levinson's movie is highly enjoyable, if cast in a conventional mold, but I'm fully going on the warpath for Barkin, who has soldiered on through a long period of post-stardom and deserves an Oscar nomination for this role, right now.	Dislikable movie characters don't always result in dislikable movies but that's certainly the case with Sam Levinson's Another Happy Day.	It's unpleasant, shrill and exhausting - everyone's so busy airing their own grievances no one has time to listen to anyone else's - but it's a genuine actors' film anchored by some good performances...	Ellen Barkin - playing the estranged mother of the groom - does a big heap of acting as one of the more histrionic members of the clan.	For all of difficulties, there is an authenticity in Levinson's work that you can see in the film, and his is a compelling voice playing in that minor key.	Another Happy Day features outstanding performances (Ellen Barkin's especially) but the characters are too unpleasant to endure.
A classic head-game of perception versus reality.	There is so much content in its 88-minute running time that even careful viewers feel their heads spinning when they first see it.	The film, a 1950 landmark exploration of the confoundingly elusive nature of truth, received an Academy Award at a time when the prize for foreign-language film did not exist.	Rashomon is a great piece of entertainment that engages your brain and your emotions	Kurosawa is always worth a look but this is a particular classic that has influenced so much to come, it's almost essential.	One of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most acclaimed films, Rashomon features an innovative narrative structure, brilliant acting, and a thoughtful exploration of reality versus perception.
The actresses, notably Fonda, are fine, but the characters are a collection of clichés and behaviors that feel as patently false as the generic town built around them.	Spin it however they like, the troubled but talented Lohan isn't what's wrong with this misbegotten mess.	Georgia Rule veers back and forth awkwardly between humour and drama, getting both wrong. The various family secrets and plot twisties in the tale are painfully, psych 101 obvious.	The characters would be better off on the set of The Jerry Springer Show than anchoring their own film.	The brassy performances and pure, at-odds variance of Georgia Rule with much of Hollywood studio product make it a welcome-enough May visitor.	Comedic and dramatic in all the wrong places, Georgia Rule is a confused dramedy that wastes the talents of its fine cast.
...it's not difficult to see why the film has endured since it's release or why a sequel was commissioned just a few years later.	Not much more than a fluffy little valentine of a movie, but there's still some actual warmth and wit underneath the "been there, seen that, nice wedding" exterior.	Too cute not to enjoy on some level, although Short manages to walk away with the film.	Some sequences and dialogue are lifted directly from the original, but in the wider context, this merely serves to underline the remake's comparative lack of tenderness and subtlety.	This Christmas film is like a chocolate Easter egg. It is sugary sweet around the outside and very light because it is really hollow.	While it doesn't quite hit the heights of the original, this remake of the 1950 classic is pleasantly enjoyable, thanks in large part to winning performances from Steve Martin and Martin Short.
James Gandolfini will be missed. He could play a brute, as in 'Killing Them Softly,' or, as he does here in 'Enough Said,' a lovable, albeit flawed, regular guy. Either way, you cared about the characters into whom the late Gandolfini breathed life.	It's a funny, tender, impactful story of two divorcées, authentically in their early 50s, struggling to trust and love again.	"Enough Said" demonstrates that adult storytelling is not dead.	A wry and moving look at a time in life that tends to get short shrift in U.S. cinema.	Louis-Dreyfus gives Enough Said exquisite vulnerability and crack comic timing, helping the helmer lift a slightly tiresome plot off the ground, finding behavioral realism in the midst of sitcom tension.	Wryly charming, impeccably acted, and ultimately quite bittersweet, Enough Said is a grown-up movie in the best possible way.
So very good in so many scenes that it almost makes you angry the movie is hampered by an uneven, flawed screenplay.	What Lies Beneath is really nothing more than a scary re-run of some better films.	It's some scary fun to watch.	Robert Zemeckis is usually such a reliable filmmaker that you really have to wonder how he managed to criminally misuse the marquee dream team of Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer.	A decent popcorn movie for adults, but not much lies beneath	Robert Zemeckis is unable to salvage an uncompelling and unoriginal film.
I always root for these kids like this. You want them to fit in and have a good experience. It's what this movie does to you; it's so full of life and spirit but it can also get real dark in places. A lot like going on a date with Mark Ellis.	The notoriously-perilous journey through late adolescence is at the heart of this ambitious child-to-adult drama.	It might not be a massive hit, but it will certainly ease a few paths through the awkwardness of adolescence.	Chbosky creates a rich and authentic portrait of high-school bohemians, searching for freedom in the stifling environment of adolescent conformity.	One of the year's most agreeable surprises on every level.	The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a heartfelt and sincere adaptation that's bolstered by strong lead performances.
The story of Pat Tillman's life and untimely death is one that lends itself to legend. Legend makes for engaging cinema. In the hands of filmmaker Amir Bar Lev, The Tillman Story is great verite cinema.	The Tillman Story puts the lie that the cover-up of his death was the result of a series of errors firmly in the ground at last.	Even if you've read a fair amount about Tillman's famous case, I bet there's stuff here to shock you.	The Tillman Story has been endorsed by Michael Moore, but that's no reason to avoid seeing it.	It's heartbreaking.	Passionate, angry, and insightful, The Tillman Story offers a revealing portrait of its subject's inspiring life and untimely death.
A romantic comedy is only as irresistible as are its temporarily star-crossed lovers. By this barometer, the enjoyably breezy Must Love Dogs boasts quite a pedigree.	...the film is ultimately difficult to resist, though it's clear that those who generally dislike this sort of thing will really hate this.	A somewhat generic romantic comedy blessed with a generous heart, bright dialogue and irresistible stars. Plus, it's not averse to taking risks.	I like the characters and the story but find that the film just doesn't go the distance in some areas.	I wouldn't call the movie a dog, but I didn't love it either. Our search for the next Great Romantic Comedy, like so many Hollywood singletons' quest for love, continues.	Despite good work from its likable leads, the romantic comedy Must Love Dogs is too predictable.
Though one can question the movie's quality as a documentary ... Aileen raises such troubling issues that it stays, hellishly, in your mind.	Alйm de investigar com maior profundidade as origens da violкncia de Aileen, o documentбrio ainda comprova a perfeiзгo da performance de Charlize Theron em Monster.	Broomfield is mostly just shooting from the hip and missing as much as he scores	Except for the sermonizing, altogether a deeper, more interesting movie than Monster.	Broomfield frequently seems as willing as his subject to indulge in conspiracy theories and there often exists the queasy hunch that his interest in her feeds her sickness.	This chilling, unsettling documentary provides an eye-opening look at both Wuornos and the American justice system.
To think of this marvelous film as merely a boxing documentary is to miss a lot.	There is a palpable tension, as the two men step into the ring, that is not lessened because we know the outcome.	Ali didn't fumble often, and neither do Gast and Hackford. This is a love-match of filmmakers and subject. Together, they go the distance.	A penetrating emotional analysis of the boxing which is nothing short of inspired.	One of the best and most emotionally affecting documentaries ever made.	An engrossing documentary that's as much about at time and a place as it is about a fight.
Seeing Kingsley sink his teeth into his pit bull hoodlum rates as Sexy Beast's greatest pleasure, but not its only one.	Ray Winstone does a fine job as the troubled Gal.	This darkly comic UK crime thriller has far more style than substance -- but what style!	Confident, mature, deeply conceived, and convincingly inhabited, it's a surprisingly humane film.	Its central theme of the lure and danger of the criminal life and a villain so perfect at personifying that theme are the propelling force of the film.	Sexy Beast rises above other movies in the British gangster genre due to its performances -- particularly an electrifying one by Ben Kingsley -- and the script's attention to character development.
The portrayal of a wounded society is compelling, and the film ends on a very modestly hopeful note, appropriate for a country where the 'dreams' have been mostly painful.	Centering on a mother-daughter relationship, the Berlin Fest winner Grbavica operates on both realistic and symbolic levels, a personal film about the country's attempt to reconcile with the brutal Bosnian civil war and its painful aftermath.	The dramatic conflicts are soapy and unsubtle, but Karanovic pours intense authority into Esma's scarred psyche.	A powerful human drama exposing family dynamics and the deep wounds that war exacts.	Gbravica is a womanly movie in the best sense: [writer-director] Zbanic has a deeply feminine sense of how crisis gets filtered through the moments of daily life.	An emotionally blunt and gripping drama, Grbavica deftly explores the emotional toll that all wars take upon those who survive them.
What appears, on the surface, to be yet another a family road movie will have you laughing out loud often and quite possibly applauding at the very end as the credits roll.	A smart, dark road comedy about a dysfunctional family that had them rolling in the aisles at this year's Sundance Film Festival.	It's got a little bit for everyone, an easily identifiable premise that makes anyone who thought their family was the nuttiest feel a little closer to normal.	This indie favorite came out of the 2006 Sundance festival with its highest price tag ever ($10.5 million, paid by Fox Searchlight) and audience raves. Fox and the fans were right.	The chaotic dinner scene pops like syncopated jazz, setting the tone for a warm, funny film that has more smiles than belly laughs.	Little Miss Sunshine succeeds thanks to a strong ensemble cast that includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, and Abigail Breslin, as well as a delightfully funny script.
Writer/director Haifaa Al-Mansour is not only the first female Saudi Arabian filmmaker, she's made the first film completely shot in her home country and the fact that it is critical of Islamic views towards women makes it all the more remarkable.	A simple story told with economy, "Wadjda" is a notable example of old-school, humanistic filmmaking.	Wadjda captures Saudi life on the cusp of serious change, but it's by no means a solemn drama. Al-Mansour writes and directs with a light touch and hopeful aspect.	It's a stunningly assured debut, a slyly subversive delight, and one of my favorite movies of the year so far.	Movies written and directed by women are unthinkable in Saudi Arabia, and indeed this film is banned in filmmaker Mansour's home country.	Transgressive in the best possible way, Wadjda presents a startlingly assured new voice from a corner of the globe where cinema has been all but silenced.
This low-budget production is all about the performances, with Kyle Chandler turning up late in the piece as Sutter's father, Smashed's Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his slightly snobby sister and a cool supporting cast of appealing young 'uns.	I think the fact that these lovers are teenagers is a bit of a distraction. This is a relationship every bit as exhilarating and thorny as any adult relationship we'll see on a movie screen.	Written by the screenwriters of (500) Days of Summer, the film injects some hard-won poignancy into the tale of a young man wavering on the precipice of adulthood.	the lessons its measures out and the means it uses to explain them create one of the best, most compelling cases for growing up ever put on film.	Teller and Woodley make lasting impressions in this bittersweet, unassuming little summer gem, a movie that's "spectacular" in own simple way.	The Spectacular Now is an adroit, sensitive film that avoids typical coming-of-age story trappings.
Counterbalancing the energy vacuum that is Cruise is the good news that this is also a Bryan Singer movie.	I love how Singer plays the whole damn thing like the greatest suspense comic-book story ever told...	Ultimately it is redeemed by its palpably clammy sense of foreboding, plus its offering of a valuable history lesson.	To Singer's credit, the film is remarkably suspenseful, even though we know pretty much how it will end.	Valkyrie is a taut suspense flick for grown-ups that asks: What if ruthless German efficiency had been used against Hitler?	Given the subject matter, Valkyrie could have been an outstanding historical thriller, but settles for being a mildly entertaining, but disposable yarn.
The actors, especially the leads, give performances ... rich, connected and full of nuance and spontaneity.	Gets at what most Hollywood movies are afraid to say about the way we live on the edge of tragedy.	My, what a delicately orchestrated film!	Field directed Tom Wilkinson, Sissy Spacek, Marisa Tomei and others to performances of true distinction.	Todd Field has constructed a remarkable first feature, directing with patient, effective pacing and a good eye for detail.	Expertly crafted and performed, In the Bedroom is a quietly wrenching portrayal of grief.
Billy Connolly alone upholds the X-Files creepiness brand. His visionary Father Joe is darkly credible, throwing into relief the film's many weaknesses.	Rather than providing a springboard to a movie franchise, this film puts the final nail in The X-Files' coffin. Mulder and Scully can now fade into pop culture history.	It's like an especially gloomy episode of the series, stretched a bit too long. And we miss the ad breaks.	The stand-alone story is an uninspired excuse to drag Fox Mulder and Dana Scully through the same faith vs. reason debates that encumbered the TV program.	A handful of TV series have moved from lengthy small screen runs to the big screen; few can match The X-Files in consistent quality and ability to engage its audience.	The chemistry between leads David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do live up to The X-Files' televised legacy, but the roving plot and droning routines make it hard to identify just what we're meant to believe in.
It's Farrell's portrayal of the smug publicist that turns the improbably absurd premise into weird, pulpy fun.	What keeps Phone Booth going, despite its premise, is the acting and the writing, both of which are top-notch.	One of those intimate and tense urban-standoff dramas of the sort that helped make the 1970s a landmark period in American film.	The stratagems that compel the film to stay put are as improbable as they are illogical.	More of a stunt than a fully-developed motion picture, but it is nonetheless pulled off with an engrossing flair.	Quick pacing and Farrell's performance help make Phone Booth a tense nail-biter.
Maybe the best of Hitchcock's early, pre-USA productions.	It's a flawless mix of paranoid suspense, pacing, timing and even comedy.	Underrated early Hitch with a killer finale.	Mais interessado em explorar a inabalável fleuma britânica como fonte de humor do que em realmente criar um suspense intrigante, este é um dos últimos exemplares da primeira fase da carreira de Hitchcock e diverte mais do que impressiona.	One of Hitch's best from his rich British period	One of Alfred Hitchcock's last British films, this glamorous thriller provides an early glimpse of the director at his most stylishly entertaining.
A fascinating documentary about a peculiarly American institution.	Intensely fascinating.	Who'd have thought a film about recreational spelling would be so completely entertaining!	Gripping and fascinating work by first-time filmmaker Jeffrey Blitz. Bravo!	Whether from a Texas ranch, a Missouri trailer park or a Washington, D.C., housing project, these spellers define something unique about the American character.	A suspenseful, gripping documentary that features an engaging cross section of American children.
Invincible is the story of Vince Papale, who was an actual figure -- a part-time bartender who went to a tryout, survived training camp, made the Eagles team, and became a Philadelphia legend.	Even though there's never any question about how it's going to play out, you still find yourself on the verge of cheering at the end.	There's a sugar coating to the way Papale's story unfolds, but not so much that you'll spoil your dinner.	The long and tedious first third of the movie is set in a working class bar in south Philly. This plodding part is pure sitcom.	fact or fiction, Invincible is still a rousing good time at the movies.	As simple and authentic as the gritty South Philly invirons in which it's set in, Invincible sends a uplifting and heartfelt message packed with an athletic enthusiasm that shouldn't be missed.
Manages to sweep you in with great help from the chemistry of Weisz and Fraser.	The movie's a blast.	It's da 'balm!'	Too bad the biggest laughs come when it takes itself seriously.	"succeeds, due to a playful sense of fun"	In The Mummy Returns, the special effects are impressive, but the characters seem secondary to the computer generated imagery.
The result is not a great film, but it is great fun.	Boldly go and revel in the awesomeness and nostalgia this action-packed prequel will elicit.	A gigantic bore for more than half its running time, but it eventually grows surprisingly involving, thanks mostly to its great cast.	Unless you live in the weeds like me, obsessing over minutia that others never even see, Star Trek is going to be a jaw-dropping experience. The rest of us will just have to get over ourselves.	Somehow pulling off the trick of appealing to the wider mass audience with one foot in Star WARS, the most startling thing about this new TREK is how it avoids being AWFUL.	Star Trek reignites a classic franchise with action, humor, a strong story, and brilliant visuals, and will please traditional Trekkies and new fans alike.
The real draw here is Swinton's subtle and extremely believable portrayal of a mother who will do anything to protect her children.	An intensely focussed piece of work, told quietly and with great texture.	Superbly acted, strangely moving.	A spare and stylish thriller that intrigues with intelligence rather than cheap shocks.	A thrummingly satisfying '40s-style women's melodrama cleverly disguised as an art-house picture.	A well-acted film noir with arresting visuals.
A romantic comedy both men and women can fall in love with ... the kind of movie you could watch all day.	The movie would have benefited from a lot more of Russell Brand, whose surreal egocentricity and vast reserves of disdain light up every scene he's in. The man wields every great line he's given like a whip.	For a film that's been lauded for its daring display of full-frontal male nudity, I got the nagging feeling that it actually played things pretty safe.	Nope, the real reason "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is so unforgettable is that its screenwriter and star Jason Segel ("Knocked Up" and TV's "How I Met Your Mother") lets it all hang out, both literally and figuratively.	Forgetting Sarah Marshall pretends to be an outrageous comedy, but still ends up finding a way to relate to everyone on a much more emotional level.	With ample laughs and sharp performances, Forgetting Sarah Marshall finds just the right mix of romantic and raunchy comedy.
The child actors are so funny that even the stalest jokes seem fresh.	Gotta love Emma Thompson. Her Nanny McPhee persona? That's another story.	Poopy fun for the tots, but Maggie Smith deserves better	Nanny McPhee turns up like magic when you need her.	It's a not-completely unwelcome and not-completely terrible sequel, one that actually betters its predecessor.	Emma Thompson's second labor of love with the Nanny McPhee character actually improves on the first, delivering charming family fare with an excellent cast.
With so many performers contributing so much solid work, it may be time to acknowledge that Daniels knows what he's doing. The guy can handle actors.	This raw and honest drama tells a story that cuts to the core of some extremely serious issues	It's hard to be unmoved by Precious' determination. Despite its melodramatic moments, remarkable performances drive home the film's inspiring message.	Though he frequently makes use of the kind of gritty aesthetic usually associated with social realism, he's not afraid of throwing more polished visual flourishes, fantasy sequences and moments of comedy into the mix.	I felt ill at ease every time Precious arrived home and I can only imagine how those unfortunate souls really living this life must feel. It's heartbreaking stuff.	Precious is a grim yet ultimately triumphant film about abuse and inner-city life, largely bolstered by exceptional performances from its cast.
Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet.	A wacky, happy, daring, darkly comic tale of parenting outside the law.	[T]his kidnapping farce from Joel and Ethan Coen is a deft nod to classic screwball comedy.	Sharp, inventive and hilarious, with a marvellous cast of Coen regulars.	One of the most original and clever little comedies I've really ever seen, and it's all due to the greatness that is the Coen Brothers.	A terrifically original, eccentric screwball comedy, Raising Arizona may not be the Coens' most disciplined movie, but it's one of their most purely entertaining.
Time paradoxes are supposed to be mind-boggling; Timecop has reduced them to a level somewhere between confusing and dumb.	In spite of its glitches, Timecop is lots of fun, a blast from the past.	Some impressive Terminator-type special effects, various plot holes, kung-fu derring-do and action as well as some wooden acting by the muscles from Brussels make for Saturday matinee entertainment, but little else.	Those who aren't easily insulted with cliches and disregard for scientific facts might still enjoy it.	It's just a bit too uneven to take advantage of its strengths.	It's no Terminator, but for those willing to suspend disbelief and rational thought, Timecop provides limited sci-fi action rewards.
As a portrait of an American family under paranormal siege, this can proudly stand next to Poltergeist.	The tension builds in 'Paranormal Activity 2,' a kind of prequel to the hit 'Paranormal Activity.' And I see a Halloween franchise in the making - one that's much weaker and less worthy than the 'Saw' films.	Instead of being trapped in one bedroom, this family has quite a few escape routes that they use quite a bit, which doesn't really help build a sense of dread. It just makes you think, "Get out of the house, fools. The door's right there."	Well, if you loved the first one, here's more of that thing you love.	PA2 is an absolute success that is smarter and scarier than the original.	Paranormal Activity 2 doesn't cover any new ground, but its premise is still scary -- and in some respects, it's a better film than the original.
Never reaches its full potential, but still manages to be better than the average, run-of-the-mill crime thriller.	Very good...	It's paced well, filmed well, and acted well, and it looks like everyone managed to pick up their paychecks well, too.	A thriller whose style, structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story, you cannot separate them.	Insomnia proves that Memento wasn't a fluke: Nolan is a major talent with many more good films ahead of him.	Driven by Pacino's performance, Insomnia is a smart and riveting psychological drama.
There's not nearly enough actual intrigue or suspense to maintain a feature film.	If not quite pornography of violence, it comes sniffingly close.	The excitement and tension comes from never knowing when Chopper is really going to lose it.	Compelling and funny even when it is indiscriminately splattering blood.	For every viewer who is revolted, at least as many will probably be intrigued, if not charmed. For Chopper is nothing if not fearless.	Eric Bana's performance as the charming but twisted Chopper is the highlight of this disturbing portrait about Australia's notorious author/criminal.
We get fast and slow motion, crane shots, split screens, handheld cinematography, tracking shots, lateral wipes, jump cuts, candy coloring, MTV-style editing, whip pans, still photographs and rapid-fire montages. You name it.	...a thrilling adventure mixing animation and live action against a propulsive techno soundtrack.	Accompanied by techno music and populated by young and likeable "hip" protagonists, Run Lola Run is very pleasing to the eyes and ears of its viewers.	Though lacking the solidity of a full feature drama, this colorfully nerve-wracking art film is an interesting study in chance	it is a German film that is being hailed for its stylishness, even to the degree that it's worth seeing just for its look...	More fun than a barrel of Jean-Paul Sartre, pic's energy riffs on an engaging love story and really human performances while offering a series of what-ifs and a blood-stirring soundtrack.
Still more evidence of how healthy and alive the Iranian cinema is, even in a society we think of as closed.	reasonably intriguing	A remarkable combination of stark realism and poetic fantasy, providing further evidence of the vibrancy of contemporary Iranian filmmaking.	What appears on the screen has a starkness that is almost indelible.	Slight but affecting.	Meshkini has made an excellent contribution to Iranian cinema with this poetic, emotionally poignant film.
Remade with lots of pizzazz but little wit or soul.	Production has been lavished with extravagant sets and locations that welcome the audience into a fantasy world of untold luxury.	Inconsistent!	The Thomas Crown Affair is a refreshingly straightforward entertainment film, made with great style.	The Thomas Crown Affair is a fun and lively thriller!	Sleek, stylish, and painlessly diverting, The Thomas Crown Affair is a remake of uncommon charm.
Smith effectively recreates the chaos of the medieval era, where the educated and ignorant alike make life-and-death decisions based on superstition.	When your bubonic-plague movie manages to avoid the specter of Monty Python's Flying Circus ("Bring out'cha dead!"), it's definitely doing something right.	Dario Poloni's script pays tribute to Werner Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath Of God, and British cult films such as The Wicker Man, but fails to bind the ingredients into anything like a plausible or satisfactory narrative.	It shows the worst things that people do to each other in the name of religion. This could have been more of a thought-provoking film, but it turns into a gore porn display.	Though deadly serious, Christopher Smith's European-made bubonic- plague melodrama provides good value with lots of blood and guts, as well as a solid cast.	Black Death delivers the fire and brimstone violence its subject matter warrants, while posing some interesting questions of faith and religion.
Though it is in constant, breathtaking motion, Zhang Yimou's gorgeous entertainment is not especially moving.	If you loved "Hero" and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," then you'll also enjoy the gorgeous "House of Flying Daggers."	Even with contrived and exaggerated emotional moments and silly action, the movie has haunting images that will stay with you.	An almost perfect expression of the genre...may not warm the heart, but it will make it jump for sheer joy at the cinematic exuberance it displays.	The action sequences are often joltingly spectacular (sure, you've seen battles staged from the tops of bamboo trees, but never in quite-so-dense forests) but largely overbaked in the CGI department.	The visual splendor of the movie makes up for the weak story.
Not exactly the toughest movie on the block, but especially compared to most American comedies, it conveys a sense of scrofulous rue.	Pungent and spirited, Up and Down shows us a nation in transition that's not necessarily a nice place to live, but it's certainly worth a visit. Especially at the movies.	Played so broadly as to be mocking.	It's been a long time since a movie allowed so many diverse narratives to fold into so unexpected, unified and satisfying a story.	A biting, darkly funny portrait of xenophobia, poverty and social confusion that has enveloped the Czech Republic some 15 years after Vaclav Havel's Velvet Revolution.	A tragi-comic exploration of the universal search for stability in post-Communist Prague.
[It's] a much-needed maturation of the Babel/Crash formula but also fails to rattle your bones the way those movies did. Pick your poison, I suppose.	There's a profundity to Fatih Akin's film as it explores relationships between father and son, mother and daughter, friends and lovers, as their lives become interconnected and their actions impact on each other. A gripping film.	Pretentious nonsense cut from the same cloth as "Crash" and "Babel". Filled to the brim with unbelievable coincidences and liberal pieties. Just the sort of thing that makes film festival panels salivate apparently.	Like a more personal, less pretentious version of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Babel, this spiraling dissection of circumstance, choice and fate is more about thoroughness of vision than tricky storytelling.	As a director [Akin] is clearly a humanist, championing the virtues of forgiveness and relying on strong narrative and deep sympathy for his characters to drive his movies.	Evocative and complex, this story of struggling immigrants in Germany will stay with you after you leave the theater.
A tired, humorless pastiche of various exploitation genres that is not the least bit imaginative in its campy deconstruction of conventions.	This is horror with a wink and a nod to drive-in theatres and sweaty back seats. This is how it's done.	Fans of the genre will like it, especially in the no-holds barred second half. Others are advised to avoid this one.	These bad-boy auteurs will have to discover some new ideas if they don't want to end up as terminally soulless as the monsters who stalk their movie.	This is a B-movie, albeit a largish budget B-movie, but with an undeniable B-movie spirit.	A pulpy crime drama/vampire film hybrid, From Dusk Till Dawn is an uneven but often deliriously enjoyable B-movie.
Heaven Knows What is a stringently unromantic portrait of fringe dwelling and love, but its authentically monotone picture of street life also makes it kind of deadening.	Together, the images and the sounds turn Harley's reality into a pulverizing grind from which escape is barely even a distant thought.	It centers on electrifying newcomer Arielle Holmes as a homeless junkie named Harley, a character largely shaped by the performer's own extremely recent past.	Cinematography by Sean Price Williams is extraordinary, overhead shots of junkies walking along a tony NYC street or a tight shot in a corner of a public library creating a specific, insular world within a diverse and distinctive city	I have to commend its messy truthfulness and near-documentary DNA.	Grueling and rewarding in equal measure, Heaven Knows What hits hard -- and serves as a powerful calling card for its captivating star, Arielle Holmes.
Mad Max is the exciting original that got the whole series (and Mel Gibson) rolling.	Beyond the explosive nature of the road movie, Mad Max also works as a character piece.	No imitation can compete with the grindhouse jaggedness of Miller's original pursuit	The most impressive feature film debut by any Australian director is also one of the best action-exploitation films ever committed to celluloid.	An action masterpiece...	Staging the improbable car stunts and crashes to perfection, director George Miller succeeds completely in bringing the violent, post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max to visceral life.
What's forceful about The Weather Underground is how effectively the filmmakers convey the violent zeitgeist of those years.	A remarkable journey.	It's hard to sit and listen to these people that are in their 50's speaking fondly of the good ole days when they had sex and drug parties and blew up stuff (yes, this is a huge exaggeration, but that's it in a nutshell - and nutty is how they sound).	The filmmakers build a compelling case for the effect of the radical left on late 20th-century American politics.	It's the thought of telling the other side of the story, or at least the side that has been forgotten, that makes the subject matter so refreshing and enthralling.	Fascinating documentary about the militant Weathermen.
Touches upon the profound human longing to escape the constraints of time, to see the wrongs and mistakes of the past somehow set right, redeemed.	Why, in the second half of Frequency, does the script allow its guts to overwhelm its spirit?	One thing the film does have in its favor is an appealing cast.	Frequency submits itself for our approval as a solid thriller, if not necessarily a timeless one.	Gripping.	A tight blend of surprises and suspense keeps audiences spellbound.
Sandler's brash, unpretentious and unsubtle family comedy might be more enjoyable if it wasn't so mean.	Hastily assembled, uneven and severely lacking in charm and laughs, Jack and Jill is one of Sandler's weakest outings to date. Which is saying something.	Jack and Jill needs less Sandler, more Pacino.	The whole drag routine just isn't all that funny, and the character eases from intolerably abrasive to tolerably dumb only when it is time to shoehorn in the usual nominal life lessons.	One can only wonder if Steve Koren's screenplay is in part inspired by Sandler's real-life attempt as a producer to pull Pacino into this wreck.	Although it features an inexplicably committed performance from Al Pacino, Jack and Jill is impossible to recommend on any level whatsoever.
It's a pleasure to see a potential franchise develop from such an unlikely source.	If Sahara weren't quite so dumb, it might have been a lot of fun.	It's a little hard to have silly fun when you are constantly being reminded that Hotel Rwanda and similar stories have been playing out down the road.	For "Sahara," the problem is that we have the Indiana Jones movies to compare it to, and I'm afraid there's no comparison. It's never more than a likable poseur.	...will leave a parched sensation in one's dry throat...a recycled buddy-buddy vehicle that's about as welcoming as hugging a cactus tree	A mindless adventure flick with a preposterous plot.
Ends up making you pine for Lucy's gift of forgetting.	It's just about impossible to dislike any movie that offers Rob Schneider getting the crap beaten out of him with a baseball bat.	When it's good, it's delightful and charming, with enough laughs to make you want to go on 50 dates with Henry and Lucy. When it's bad, it's awful.	The spark between the stars and a surprisingly thoughtful screenplay ensures that, despite the odd gross-out misstep, this is a sweet, warm and funny romantic comedy.	When not obsessed with hitting the giggly teenage boy demographic, 50 First Dates concentrates on a situation that requires Sandler to act grown up and responsible.	Gross-out humor overwhelms the easy chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, who bring some energy and yucks to this tale of a girl with short-term memory loss and the guy who tries to get her to love him.
If nothing else, it brilliantly captures the moods and tempo of New York: its vibrant pulse, its energy, its ethnic diversity, its clamorous excitement.	To see this film is to understand why it is better to have loved and maybe lost, as the cliché goes, than to have missed out on the messy exhilaration of it all	This love letter to the Big Apple has more than its share of worms.	The vignettes range from mildly humorous to relentlessly tedious, as the seemingly endless 'look at me' vanity procession drags its feet along to the credits.	... for all the voices brought in to the project there's not much variety of style or story or even neighborhood, and very little effort to explore the variety of cultures...	Like many anthologies, New York, I Love You has problems of consistency, but it isn't without its moments.
In his finest, funniest, most poignant film to date, Tim Burton plays cinematic alchemist, turning drive-in schlock into movie gold.	[It] remains the greatest movie about the pleasures and hardships of independent filmmaking.	It certainly succeeds as a funny, touching tribute to tenacity, energy, ambition and friendship.	Tim Burton's best movie.	Given the finished film, one also has to wonder if Ed Wood was interesting enough to base a two- hour movie on.	Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team up to fete the life and work of cult hero Ed Wood, with typically strange and wonderful results.
[They] think all the world wants is an inane plot to justify the drawing of it,and that's enough. Kids have never been that stupid & they will never be.	While the movie is visually stunning, the characterizations and music are a bit weak.	An entertaining romp through history and romance that is best suited to young girls who should enjoy its G-rated passion.	What redeems Anastasia from its dramatic slackness and drab songs are the performances from the actors.	Having something for everyone seems to be a driving force for this film.	Beautiful animation, an affable take on Russian history, and strong voice performances make Anastasia a winning first film from Fox animation studios.
Light hearted and fun!	The film creaked to a halt like a 1956 Buick running on fumes!	...applies a layer of Hollywood gloss, sentimentality, and hyperbole to the proceedings.	The trio of credited writers exhibits a complete failure of imagination!	Practical Magic is delightful sweetmeat for Halloween.	Comedy, romance, and humor mix with unsatisfying results.
Cool yet scathing.	As a clever joke, the filmmakers run down a list of the traits of a psychopath and find a corporate action to match each one. Diagnosis: psychopath. It's cute, but it's a logical fallacy.	The information is there, it is important, and The Corporation gets it across in mostly engaging style.	A staggering number of interviews and piles of footage both stock and new provide insight and provoke thought, and the whole thing's pretty darn entertaining, too.	...engaging in the best sense of the word.	The Corporation is a satisfyingly dense, thought-provoking rebuttal to some of capitalism's central arguments.
Has none of the social edge that made the Vietnam-era film the pride of the hixploitation genre.	Is this a dumb movie? Yes. Is it rich with character? No. But is it fun? Yes -- thanks to The Rock's Bam-Bam antics, agreeable demeanor, and natural screen abilities.	This revised Walking Tall has only kinetic energy going for it.	The Rock Walking Tall	This is a classic example of a film assuming we will be on the side of its protagonist just BECAUSE he's the protagonist. In fact, he behaves like a big, dumb animal.	The Rock makes a competent hero, but the movie is content to let a 2x4 do all the talking.
Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry.	The film is probably worth seeing for the sheer spectacle of it all, for the sake of obtaining valuable information, and for finding more closure on a story that has always been missing several pieces.	Though, lacking in plotline it makes up for in action and entertainment.	Wonder, hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along, especially if it begins with the name of Star Wars	Watching Attack of the Clones is like getting rapped on the head with a rubber mallet -- no lasting damage (I pray and hope), but bad enough to bring on an acute bout of dizziness and disorientation.	Though it still suffers from an overabundance of exposition, the action quotient is upped considerably in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, which makes it an improvement over The Phantom Menace.
A somber, studiedly intense drama that is absorbing despite its total predictability.	The intellectual cut-and-thrust of the courtroom is largely absent here, and the denouement seems slick, arbitrary, and derived from the Captain Queeg catalogue.	That rarest of things: a top-level Hollywood court-room drama with the smarts to match its slick style.	The film, as it progresses, begins to seem like Reiner's own military exercise -- all professional polish, no soul.	I'm usually a sucker for courtroom dramas, but Rob Reiner's highly mechanical 1992 feature... kept putting me to sleep.	An old-fashioned courtroom drama with a contemporary edge, A Few Good Men succeeds on the strength of its stars, with Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, and especially Jack Nicholson delivering powerful performances that more than compensate for the predictable plot.
...We take pleasure in screenwriters [Harold] Ramis and Danny Rubin out-fantasizing us.	An inventive and consistently humorous movie that depends on the ultimate gimmick.	Something very rare in today's Hollywood -- a film that is in the same time very funny and very humane, thought-provoking yet entertaining.	While Murray's deadpan putdowns and dry dismissals of provincial peccadilloes are the comic highlights, Groundhog Day is no supercilious rip of small-town U.S.A.	[Murray] carries Groundhog Day with his uniquely frittery nonchalance and makes the movie a comic time warp anyone should be happy to get stuck in.	Smart, sweet, and inventive, Groundhog Day highlights Murray's dramatic gifts while still leaving plenty of room for laughs.
The screenplay by David Odell, based on a story by Mr. Henson, is without any narrative drive whatever. It's without charm as well as interest.	You have to love a fantasy whose greatest peril is the Bog of Eternal Stench.	A bittersweet spectacle.	It's a story as old as time redone in books and films over and over again. But this one's got the one-of-a-kind Henson vision and style.	This ersatz Tolkien with puppets looks and plays like ersatz Tolkien with puppets.	The Dark Crystal's narrative never quite lives up to the movie's visual splendor, but it remains an admirably inventive and uniquely intense entry in the Jim Henson canon.
The movie contains the usual stock horror characters, but they are supplied with dialogue, often surprisingly smart and funny, that serves as a running, biting commentary on slasher conventions.	If the people who made Scream were half as clever as they seem to think they are, this would be a much smarter movie.	The pic's chills are top-notch, but its underlying mockish tone won't please die-hard fans.	Scream may be a cut above the gore fests that line the dimly lit back wall at your video store, but it is a far cry from genre classics like Halloween or Craven's own Nightmare On Elm Street.	Scream builds to a splattering finale that should leave genre fans highly satisfied. Here's one of the year's better thrillers.	Horror icon Wes Craven's subversive deconstruction of the genre is sly, witty, and surprisingly effective as a slasher film itself, even if it's a little too cheeky for some.
It feels less like a movie and more like a violation... Noe subverts cheap satisfactions of the genre and questions how we look at revenge pictures in the first place.	This movie is over-the-top and infuriating at times, but in the end, I consider it a success on some very ****ed up level.	It should not be dismissed as cheap gimmickry or a shock tactic.	Fails because of its gratuitous rape and violence and also because of its pretentious and intellectually one-dimensional grounds, which make the violence at the end feel even worse.	Convinces me as nothing else so far that I have reached the point of diminishing returns with movies that pretend to be profound by having their pulpy, banal stories told backwards and sideways and upside-down.	Though well-filmed, Irreversible feels gratuitous in its extreme violence.
Curious but acceptable.	Some of it is terrific. And some of it is spectacular.	One of the best Bond movie ever, this thriller offers up great action sequences and a smart dialogue.	...tough and grim but still spry ... feels like something of a rearguard action in the case of the British Empire.	Mendes distills the Bond ethos in a single sequence: it's sex and death as irresistible surface and sheen.	Sam Mendes brings Bond surging back with a smart, sexy, riveting action thriller that qualifies as one of the best 007 films to date.
While arousing trepidations, this latest entry is oft-times digestible, thanks largely to its juicy subject.	A winning cast and a magnum's worth of subplots make Bottle Shock extremely watchable, perhaps a bit fruity, with grace notes of leather, oak and no ham.	Is there room in the world for yet another movie about wine? If the movie is Bottle Shock then nope.	It's such a rewarding movie going experience it's tempting to trot out all the adjectives generally used to describe a good wine. Not being a connoisseur I'll just say that it left me with a very pleasant buzz.	It's passable, while hinting at better things.	Bottle Shock fails to properly utilize the inspiring true tale at its core, settling instead for an ordinary, plodding account.
The movie is overproduced in every way but the most important one: Other than an occasional token rhyme, this Cat in the Hat lands flat-footed and with tin ear, drained of its essential Dr. Seussness.	I don't remember a rave scene with a cameo by hoochy hotel heiress Paris Hilton in Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat, do you?	Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat is a triumph above all of production design. That's partly because the production design is so good, partly because the movie is so disappointing.	About as creatively inspired as a giant hairball.	much of the film is padded out by the comic business of Mike Myers' cat, in a deeply flawed role falling somewhere between a stand-up dying on stage or an alcoholic clown harassing kids at a birthday party.	Filled with double entendres and potty humor, this Cat falls flat.
Bring earplugs to Batman & Robin. A pair of noseplugs wouldn't hurt, either.	Pointless, plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless, comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue.	Some nifty celestial surfing and a good finale compensate for a dead midsection.	For all its star power and stylish toys, it never really rises above the level of a Saturday morning cartoon.	It represents the things I really, really dislike about Hollywood and its overblown product.	Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in Batman & Robin resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to care much for.
...at its best when demonstrating its creator's talents rather than having characters explicitly expound on them.	There's nourishment to be had, if you lower your expectations. But be warned: a lot of it is just watching Jon Favreau make toasties in a van.	There's an important distinction between food porn and food propaganda, and Chef doesn't always know the difference. Still, mostly delightful whenever Favreau isn't making a 5th-grade book report about social media.	Good fun and happy, filling fare.	Like all good food porn, the story here is wafer-thin at best.	Chef's charming cast and sharp, funny script add enough spice to make this feel-good comedy a flavorful -- if familiar -- treat.
The concept is so hypocritical, it's like Britney Spears calling Christina Aguilera underdressed and overexposed.	Chock full of bad jokes, adult outfits no teen should ever attempt wearing and ditzy comments from the trio's drummer Melody.	The sour notes are all in a dumbed-down script, canned-ham performances that soon wear thin.	Keeping in mind that the film is based on comic book characters, the overall result is better than most ...	An antiadvertisement for itself, a subversive piece of work.	This live-action update of Josie and the Pussycats offers up bubbly, fluffy fun, but the constant appearance of product placements seems rather hypocritical.
The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame.	Told in scattered fashion, the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject.	Guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook, rattled, or rolled.	It's a blast!	I promise, you'll never listen to a Motown classic in the same way ever again.	A toe-tapping tribute to the band that gave Motown its sound.
There's so much death, but the dramatic intensity is missing. It should have you weeping and gripping your seat and sick over all the tragedy %u2013 and that just doesn't happen.	Shock cinema? Yes, but with a story and with a point.	The most controversial movie that Steven Spielberg has ever created. It's also one of his best	Munich rarely rises above its own predictability to become more than a noble failure.	Ten-time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski utilizes a technique dubbed 'skip bleach' (also used in Jarhead) that renders the image grainy and harsh.	Steven Spielberg's examination of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the aftermath of the Munich assassinations is politically even-handed and cinematically visceral.
Not quite a classic, but a marvelous movie.	...a captivating romantic comedy that lives up to its place as a classic of the genre.	Breakfast at Tiffany's will live on as long as there are lovers to watch it.	Although the movie won Oscars for music and song ("Moon River") by Henry Mancini, "Breakfast At Tiffany's" has a dark underbelly and unlikable characters made attractive by their eccentric behavior and expensive wardrobes.	When it comes to cinematic fashion and romance, perhaps none are more iconic than Blake Edwards' Breakfast at Tiffany's.	It contains some ugly anachronisms, but Blake Edwards is at his funniest in this iconic classic, and Audrey Hepburn absolutely lights up the screen.
I'd put [Johnnie] To's Exiled into the category of Hong Kong movies that even people who think they don't care about Hong Kong movies should see.	...Exiled is compromised by the feeling one gets that Johnnie To has been watching too many westerns. Like in a Sergio Leone movie, all the characters try to strike iconic poses, clad with shades, munching on cigars, tilted gun in hand.	a moody crime drama that doubles as a revolutionary political allegory - ringing the changes on China's evolving reunification even as it longs for a future that will return to the noblest values of the past.	If it weren't for those pesky subtitles, you'd swear it was the best summer action film of the year.	Ballet-like bloodsport reminiscent of the eye-pleasing, if gratuitous, gore of such over-stimulation mavens as John Woo and Sam Peckinpah. Taut testosterone-sodden titillation, if graphic gunplay's your pleasure.	Exiled has non-stop action, tension and style -- making it an excellent summer action movie. Johnnie To brings beautiful scenery and camerawork to the film, enhancing the action even more.
A film as rich in its visual presentation as it is in its emotional resonance.	By the way it's shot and directed, it's easy to see how people can spend their entire lives in the country.	Robert Redford is one of those unquenchable movie stars who look ever more fascinating as they mature. His new drama, The Horse Whisperer, shows him at his rugged best.	For such a long meal it certainly isn't very filling.	Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.	It might be a bit too eager to tug the heartstrings, but The Horse Whisperer is typically graceful, well-crafted Redford -- on both sides of the camera.
not a nihilistic work of cinematic art, but a laugh-out-loud slapstick free-for-all.	None of the four morality plays ... are necessarily original in plot, nor is the film itself particularly innovative in its structure ... it just seems flat and useless.	aforitis dithenias ki ysterikis fotoskiasis spondyloto drama gia ti zoi, to sympan, kai ola ayta, opoy tesseris istories periplekontai me tin haraktiristiki, anamenomena problepsimi apithanotita toy eidoys, gia na ftiaksoyn me to zori, tin hrysi pleksoyda	With any luck, The Air I Breathe should be the last gasp of the faux-Altmanesque school of serendipitous storytelling.	Brendan Fraser is Pleasure, Sarah Michelle Gellar is Sorrow, Kevin Bacon is Love, Forest Whitaker is Happiness, and the director is Pretension.	The Air I Breathe is a jumbled indie production that accomplishes little save for the squandering of a talented cast.
As forgettable as Austin Powers in Goldmember	This film is sometimes too familiar, especially in early scenes that deliberately repeat the first film's gags. But the formula isn't tired yet.	Hilarious.	[The] same concepts that looked refreshing and entertaining two years earlier, seem boring and repetitive now.	If ever there was an unnecessary sequel, it's Wayne's World 2.	The characters are still endearing, but the jokes in Wayne's World 2 are more hit-and-miss the second time around.
A meandering, confused, frustrating film about a meandering, confused, frustrating war.	What's so good about the movie is Gyllenhaal's refusal to show off; he doesn't seem jealous of the camera's attention when it goes to others and is content, for long stretches, to serve simply as a prism though which other young men can be observed.	We should all hope that our personal frustrating dead ends are directed by Sam Mendes...beautifully realized and sobering.	The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid the politics surrounding the first Gulf War even as they pay tribute to the Marines, the jarheads, who went to Saudi Arabia to fight. But the result is a movie rife with ambivalence.	... keeps the focus squarely on the embattled title characters, valiantly struggling to survive the only war they know: the one inside their heads.	This first person account of the first Gulf War scores with its performances and cinematography but lacks an emotional thrust.
This film explores the complexities and complications of modern love and life in an international setting with dialog that is smart and elegant, but it lacks the romance and sense of place featured in the first two films.	It's a brave, challenging and essential installment in what is one of modern cinema's finest trilogies.	The performances and dialogue are so good that it's quite possible to overlook what an elegant and fluid film Linklater has made	A couple persistently digging at each other might have been insufferable to watch except that Hawke and Delpy manage to be goofy, funny, witty and charming, even while they're fighting.	Before Midnight is fascinating to watch, and so long as Celine and Jesse are communicating, there's still hope.	Building on the first two installments in Richard Linklater's well-crafted Before trilogy, Before Midnight offers intelligent, powerfully acted perspectives on love, marriage, and long-term commitment.
Tykwer demonstra conhecer as convenушes bрsicas do gЖnero espionagem ao trazer uma atmosfera de intriga internacional Я narrativa.	This international conspiracy thriller is like a Robert Ludlum movie without Paul Greengrass	It's not that The International needed more action scenes per se, but a bigger dose of personality.	The whole indeed proves to be greater than the parts thanks to Tykwer's direction.	The International possesses the look and feel of a thriller, but not the heart or soul of one.	The International boasts some electric action sequences and picturesque locales, but is undone by its preposterous plot.
A ho-hum series of kills and lulls so predictable that it doesn't even look like much fun for the sharks; when they open wide, they might as well be yawning.	Shark Night, handled with impersonality by Snakes on a Plane pilot David R. Ellis, aspires to nothing more or less than carrying along an audience through a string of unremarkable kills, often involving high-jumping fish.	... a new movie genre: sharxploitation ...	It doesn't even live up to the minimal promises of the title: There isn't enough shark action, it mostly takes place during the day, and the 3-D only asserts itself in a couple of shots.	The one crime a B-movie should never commit is boring its audience. By even these low standards, "Shark Night 3D" is dead in the water.	A joyless excursion into the water that doesn't even produce good gore or nudity thanks to the neutered PG-13 rating.
With all of these crazy characters running around and Hans Zimmer's perfect Spaghetti Western score, "Rango" is a treat for everyone who enjoys animation.	Admirably ambitious animated ode to Spaghetti Westerns featuring a Johnny Depp-voiced lizard as the unlikely hero.	Neither Rango the mash-up movie nor Rango the lizard is particularly lovable. But there's no denying the intrigue in its combination of the good, the bad, and the ugly.	A CGI western comedy populated by desert critters, Rango gives the film year a belated jump start with a passel of movie-wise fun and a knockout animation style.	The strangeness is off the scale in a kooky concoction that might have been hatched at the bottom of a bong. Then again, what do you expect with Johnny involved?	Rango is a smart, giddily creative burst of beautifully animated entertainment, and Johnny Depp gives a colorful vocal performance as a household pet in an unfamiliar world.
The problem here is that, in telling his harrowing story, American filmmaker Matthew Ryan Hoge makes it so dry and pedantic that it feels like a doctoral thesis, not a drama.	Ambitious but flawed.	Hoge pours his heart and his considerable writing talent into this exploration of one of our time's most puzzling phenomena: juvenile violence.	An exasperating film about teen violence and suburban dysfunction that wears its confusion like a badge of honor.	Ponderous, un-clever, and almost aggressively humorless.	The United States of Leland has its moments, but they're undermined by a muddled plot, unsympathetic characters, and frustratingly uneven performances.
genuinely clunky	The clunky happily-ever-after ending is a bit too nicey-nice but with all of the wall-to-wall action, ultra-violent gunplay and over-the-top writing it is an amusing ride.	races along the thin line between tense thriller and overheated, campy exploitation flick.	You could laugh off the film's more over-the-top aspects -- including the performances and its quasi-Quentin Tarantino dialogue -- if it didn't treat women and children with such brutality and contempt.	A kinetic guilty pleasure.	This film runs with frenetic energy punctuated by gratuitous violence but sorely lacks in plot, character development and stylistic flair.
Some cracks -- and Snoop Dogg voicing a talking rat -- are funny, sure, but Malibu quickly becomes a repetitious beat of Kennedy not getting it.	Kennedy skewers the stereotypes that Bringing Down the House merely regurgitated and he plunges into the social satire that Head of State merely skimmed.	Malibu's Most Wanted is nothing to pinch your nose over, but it doesn't give Kennedy the street cred we know he's capable of.	Malibu gets to the heart of the manner by showing that sometimes Blackness is just an act - a collection of style, slang and movement being packaged and sold to everyone via three-minute music videos.	For shizzle, Malibu's Most Wanted is a comedy that's off the hizzie.	There are some laughs, but not enough to sustain the running time.
Northam provides low-key comic counterpoint to Zahn's hilariously manic turn. Macy's deadpan, earnest sheriff is the one to watch, though.	Happy, Texas is a good, winning combination of imitation and inventiveness.	This is one of those comedies that doesn't pound us on the head with the obvious, but simply lets us share vast amusement.	As sweet-natured and likable as it is, Happy, Texas still falls short in the one department that really counts for a movie comedy - real, honest-to-goodness belly laughs.	Uneven in places but with a few choice hilarious moments, it is well worth the rental.	A smart, light-hearted romantic comedy, Happy, Texas uses its well-written script and exceptional cast to prove there's still life left in the fish-out-of-water caper genre.
There's nothing revelatory and very little surprising in this Norwegian based-on-a-true-story drama, but you'd have to be a stone not to find it at least a little bit stirring.	Moody atmospherics enhance the conventional structure, and Holst's solid storytelling balances the heavy-handed symbolism.	The film plays well, and is involving, but in one form or another, this is a story often told.	beneath the staid, ordered, colour-dulled surfaces of Marius Holst's King of Devil's Island lurk various forms of hypocrisy, corruption and abuse, suggesting something very rotten in the (then) state of Norway.	This may be a familiar tale - rough-around-the edges dissenter against a barbaric system - but it's well told and the icy wastes of the island provide a chilling backdrop to the cruelty dealt out to the boys.	Scandinavian in the most bleakly satisfying way, King of Devil's Island satisfies with a richly layered narrative and a typically strong performance from Stellan Skarsgard.
Cars is the first Pixar flick I'd describe as "cynical," and that, frankly, breaks my heart just a little bit.	Musty, corny, and largely devoid of any enchanting magic, it's also the pioneering Pixar's first effort that, trailblazing technical virtuosity be damned, feels disappointingly regressive.	Runs on a half tank of entertainment	a steep step downwards for all and everything concerned, unless you're a Caucasian sports car	Pixar finally rolled out a clunker.	Cars offers visual treats that more than compensate for its somewhat thinly written story, adding up to a satisfying diversion for younger viewers.
Sesame Street fans will love this sweet movie.	Kids who love Barney or the Muppets will undoubtedly feel right at home.	The Jim Henson folks, who earlier this year gave us Muppets from Space, come up with another winner.	A delightful little picture.	The character is bereft of subtlety, the lessons are simple, loud, and clear, and there is a suprising dearth of comedy.	This fun and moral tale entertains both first-time Seasame Street watchers and seasoned veterans.
... a stylish effort that smartly avoids a straightforward approach in portraying Wilson as a troubled genius.	The result is a disorienting and disappointing experience that finds one thinking a bit too obsessively about how little Dano and Cusack look alike.	Paul Dano steals the show. Elizabeth Banks is terrific.	The Dano sequences also benefit enormously from the dense sound collages created by composer Atticus Ross and utilised by director Bill Pohlad to dramatise Wilson's inner turmoil.	Love & Mercy is a strong, unconventionally entertaining movie about the mysteries of the psyche the creative process and it's graced by a knowing, charismatic, heartbreaking performance from a never better Dano.	As unconventional and unwieldy as the life and legacy it honors, Love & Mercy should prove moving for Brian Wilson fans while still satisfying neophytes.
One of the busiest car-chase/ car-crash movies ever.	Have you noticed that the older he gets, the more Matt Damon resembles Ray Liotta? 'It's essential preparation for my remake of Operation Dumbo Drop,' notes Matt.	Almost everything that made The Bourne Identity refreshing -- the wit, the irony, the suspense, the novelty of its premise -- is gone.	Much like Spider-Man 2, this action sequel...essentially delivers more of exactly what you'd expect, along with a blatant hook for the inevitable part three.	While not as engaging as "The Bourne Identity," the sequel fills a void in the undernourished spy movie genre.	A well-maded sequel that delivers the thrills.
While the film breaks no new ground, it offers the kind of simple, well-crafted, family entertainment that used to be a staple of the Disney studio.	A friend and I go to a 'sort of trashy' movie every Christmas. This was less trashy than most.	There are enough laughs to make it worth a look for Allen's legion of fans.	Like most modern fantasies, The Santa Clause isn't very clear about the rules governing Scott's new powers.	Tim Allen made his feature debut in this engaging yuletide comedy, which is likely to appeal to the whole family and brims over with plenty of good ideas.	The Santa Clause is utterly undemanding, but it's firmly rooted in the sort of good old-fashioned holiday spirit missing from too many modern yuletide films.
A benign, tot-oriented fable sharing a heartwarming message about the true meaning of friendship.	The writers and directors make it work by never losing sight of the spirit of the characters, world, and Milne: imagination, innocence, and heaps of heart.	A back-to-basics charmer evoking the Pooh short films from the '60s and '70s. [Blu-ray]	This is a fantastic family movie-going experience.	Reassuring on such a deep level because the characters are aspects of each of us and each of their struggles and mistakes feels very true to us.	Short, nostalgic, and gently whimsical, Winnie the Pooh offers young audiences -- and their parents -- a sweetly traditional family treat.
Long, but lovely and romantic, and epic!	David Lean's 1965 adaptation of Pasternak's romance of the Russian Revolution is intelligent and handsomely mounted, though it doesn't use its length to build to a particularly complex emotional effect.	The movie is something that should be experienced by everyone at least once in a lifetime.	As always, Lean's handling of the purely physical aspects of the material is spectacular.	...an apocalypse movie in the guise of a romantic period piece.	It may not be the best of David Lean's epics, but Dr. Zhivago is still brilliantly photographed and sweepingly romantic.
Hard as nail crime saga with a blistering central performance.	It's hard to imagine it now, but there are only two types of cop movie: pre and post-The French Connection. That's how big it is.	Popeye also earned counterculture points by mistakenly shooting a federal agent and exhibiting a conspicuous lack of remorse.	Young director Friedkin produced a suspenseful and utterly absorbing film which incorporated thrills with street humor and routine police work with highly dramatic scenes.	This 1971 thriller about a heroin bust is solid, slick filmmaking, full of dirty cops, shrewd operators, and slam-bang action.	Realistic, fast-paced and uncommonly smart, The French Connection is bolstered by stellar performances by Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider, not to mention William Friedkin's thrilling production.
When MST3K is on the mark, it's a howl. Only a couple of jokes (like a dated John Sununu reference and one or two flatulence bits) really fall flat.	A flat-out hilarious celebration of B-moviemaking mastery.	In the theater, whenever Mike, Crow or Tom Servo flub a punchline or resort to a fart joke, you almost want to lean forward and shush them.	In the trip from small screen to big, virtually all of what made the show so smart and funny has emerged unscathed.	It's fun for the entire family. And one more thing. Push the button, Frank.	Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie may be thin and uneven, but it's hilarious in enough of the right spots to do the show's big-screen transition justice.
Rappaport does a yeoman's job in this tonally confused oddity.	What begins as a mildly amusing indie lark descends into a depressingly unappealing exercise in mico-budget filmmaking.	A beautiful metaphor for the desperate need to be important in a world where we rarely make personal connections any more, Special deserves to be seen.	Eccentric, depressing thriller won't grab teens' attention.	Special enjoyably toys with some knockabout comedy until it begins to take itself too seriously.	This quirky indie comedy's low budget is readily apparent, but it's elevated by Michael Rapaport's dedicated performance.
A masterfully smooth grift that's built on golden-age savvy but never feels like a rose-tinted throwback.	The camaraderie between the two principal actors is almost as appealing as it was in Butch Cassidy.	The film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it.	Smart, stylish caper -- but not for kids.	A perfectly calibrated machine designed to be as entertaining as possible in as many ways as possible.	Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and director George Roy Hill prove that charm, humor, and a few slick twists can add up to a great film.
Old-hand Craven delivers a delectably gruesome, well-crafted horror yarn that is crisply edited, inventively photographed and devilishly cast.	There's a lot more going on here than in Scream... So why isn't it a slam dunk? Because of the writing, which is just lousy in any number of ways.	I enjoyed Scream 2.	While the shocks come thick and fast, the real pleasure comes from the knowing humour and ingenious spoofing of genre tropes.	Williamson and Craven do a good job spoofing the first film, but they continue to drive some of the same points home over and over again.	As with the first film, Scream 2 is a gleeful takedown of scary movie conventions that manages to poke fun at terrible horror sequels without falling victim to the same fate.
When bodies appear through walls or fly up into the air, it is almost as if Cocteau's camera has miraculously recorded a dream.	One of the greatest fairy tales ever made. Pure film magic in any language.	This film is such a visual delight that I gave up worrying about ideological considerations and just embraced its beautiful and influential dreamlike imagery.	It is a credit to Cocteau's genius (and to that of his collaborators) that he has taken the unreal world of a fairy tale and made it as real as the world around us.	By conjuring up ... fairy-tale trappings, then aiming it all at adults, Beauty and the Beast reminds us that motion pictures can tap into our childlike fears and pleasures without becoming childish in the process.	With its magical optical effects and enchanting performances, Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast remains the most surreal -- and soulful -- of the fairy tale's film adaptations.
An invigorating, frequently hilarious piece of pop cinema that has a palpable heartbeat even amid its more archetypal beats.	Disney plus Marvel plus Pixar's John Lasseter equals an enjoyable jumble of kid-approved action.	Excess leads to excitement, and exhilaration, and entertainment.	Your kids will love it. And frankly, they should: Big Hero 6 is zippy, beautifully made, fraught with action and peril but never scary or bloody and features a vocal team of actors so smooth and polished it verges on the criminal.	The pudgy robot Baymax steals the show.	Agreeably entertaining and brilliantly animated, Big Hero 6 is briskly-paced, action-packed, and often touching.
Stories We Tell starts out as a simple investigation into the life of a mother that director Sarah Polley barely knew and slowly turns into a documentary that is as good as any movie you will see this year.	A genre-twisting documentary with a fictional vibe that playfully bares the elusive truths about a family of storytellers.	Don't let anyone spoil the surprises that unravel in this movie as Polley has her brilliant way with the elusiveness of truth.	As with her other films, when Sarah Polley takes it upon herself to tell us a story, you can bet it's a tale well-told and one that you'll want to hear.	Don't be fooled by its deceptively simple title or the hesitant, unassuming way it begins. Writer-director Sarah Polley's "Stories We Tell" ends up an invigorating powerhouse of a personal documentary, adventurous and absolutely fascinating.	In Stories We Tell, Sarah Polley plays with the documentary format to explore the nature of memory and storytelling, crafting a thoughtful, compelling narrative that unfolds like a mystery.
Legend's ultimate saving grace is that the haunting beauty of those little round faces is assured.	Grave and heavy from start to finish, Legends of the Guardians doesnt really take flight until the glorious battle scene at the end.	This is unlikely to win Kathryn Lansky's antipodean owl fantasy any new fans, but even the bemused (and confused) can luxuriate in some grand-scale visual storytelling.	A Secret of Nimh for a new era ... this time starring owls.	Though anything is possible, I seriously doubt that 'Use your gizzard' will supplant 'Trust the Force' anytime soon.	Legend of the Guardians' dark tone and dazzling visuals are to be admired, even if they're ultimately let down by a story that never lives up to its full potential.
While not lacking for lamentations from women or anybody else, primarily concentrates on the "crush your enemies" part. The movie fails because it can't make that gore interesting	You don't go to a movie like this expecting to hear Shakespearean dialogue, but the action, under Marcus Nispel's direction, is consistently vigorous and exciting. So are the visual effects, from an epic battle with sand creatures to a...	The 2011 version of Conan the Barbarian looks cheap and feels rushed. The few good elements are dwarfed by a generic, nonsensical plot and shoddy storytelling.	Born on a battlefield! Blood blood blood! Bone crunching! Burn burn burn! In 3D!	A mix of limb-lopping mayhem and mystical mumbo-jumbo.	While its relentless, gory violence is more faithful to the Robert E. Howard books, Conan the Barbarian forsakes three-dimensional characters, dialogue, and acting in favor of unnecessary 3D effects.
A helpful and healing documentary for families about the work of two woman who are caring for orphan elephants and orangutans.	This may make me sound like less of a man, but I'm going to say it anyway: Born to Be Wild is by far the most adorable movie I've seen in the theater in a long time.	Although it runs just a fleet 40 minutes, the film proves a rich and memorable journey.	Born to be Wild is both grand spectacle and intimate tale.	It's entertaining, poignant, educational (at least for kids), inspirational, and certainly beautiful to look at.	The human story of Born To Be Wild is captivating and the accompanying nature footage is utterly cute and charming.
The no-brow acting, oversimplifying of the path to success and supersappy ending are only some of the film's fatal flaws.	...what incentive did anyone have in even making this hopeless mess?	An instant camp classic.	The film seems to suffer from a kind of death wish, bent on offering itself up for audience ridicule.	It's so badly botched that it's entertaining ... for all the wrong reasons.	Glitter is a hodgepodge of movie cliches and bad acting that's sure to generate unintentional laughs. Unfortunately, the movie is not bad enough to be good.
A mixed bag.	Frequently disgusting and infantile, but entertaining nonetheless.	`Porky's' never had wit like this.	Just when you begin to wonder if it's ever going to get funny, or if it's going to be merely desperate all the way through, it lifts off like a wobbly helicopter -- and somehow it keeps flying.	The movie misses most of what is truly funny and compelling about the universal Western European adventure.	A trip worth taking if one's not offended by gratuitous nudity and bad taste.
As relaчѕes entre os personagens e as seqќъncias de perseguiчуo sуo fascinantes, mas a tentativa de "amarrar" a trama acaba comprometendo um roteiro que nуo precisava disso.	John Frankenheimer used to make real movies.	Depicts the amoral world of masterless warriors whose lives are filled with unending violence and betrayal.	A somewhat muddled yarn that's more tease than delivery.	Whatever the film lacks in coherence it makes up for in spectacular car chases.	This is comparable to French Connection with great action, dynamic road chase scenes, and solid performances.
It is an undeniably slow film, but there is something enchanting in its pace, as it gradually immerses you in its imagery, its soundtrack and its otherworldly quality.	What a lovely film this is, and what a welcome comeback for one of Britain's greatest film-makers.	Of Time and The City should inspire moviegoers to pursue full recognition of their cultural experience. Davies doesn't detach art from life; he knows it's the key to what makes us citizens and humans.	A lyrical poem about his hometown, this is Davies' first movie in eight years. And his artistic approach gives us a moving, kaleidoscopic portrait both of a city and of the filmmaker himself.	A compelling and unique character study.	Terrence Davies' heartfelt, sometimes funny new feature documentary is part scrapbook, part confessional.
This remarkable film's final shot evokes a changing season and perhaps a changing cultural tide.	A lot is demanded of Julianne Moore, and she comes through with a performance of superhumanly controlled stylization.	That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace.	A ravishingly beautiful film.	A handsome tribute to an era as quaintly distant as tail-fin Chevrolets and A-bomb scares.	An exquisitely designed and performed melodrama, Far From Heaven earns its viewers' tears with sincerity and intelligence.
Where Cemetery Junction's strength lies is in its depiction of the relationship between three friends.	This is a passable, mildly diverting, coming-of-age Brit-flick. Coming from the Gervais/Merchant stable though, it's a frustrating let-down after past successes.	A romanticised but still truthful look at how difficult it is to cut the ties to the hometown of your childhood and actually strike out on your own...	The plot ambles and Gervais and Merchant can't resist neatly tying up every loose end in a manner which strains credibility. Their dramatic crescendo is a mother pouring a cup of tea.	In its closing moments, Cemetery Junction is both youthfully optimistic and intelligently mature. But by then it's pretty much dead and buried.	It fails to challenge the well-established conventions of its storyline, but Cemetery Junction benefits from the genuine warmth of its script, as well as its refusal to give in to cheap nostalgia.
It's just a little too jarring to be top notch, but it sure is powerful.	Shakespeare's name fills up the title, but this is clearly Luhrmann's vision and it's a genuinely inventive one.	So obnoxiously brash and in-your-face that it just becomes tiresome.	A psychedelic assault on the senses; a trip of unparalleled originality.	It would be destined for the trash heap of Shakespeare adaptations, if not for its female lead, and its heart, 17-year-old Claire Danes.	Baz Luhrmann's visual aesthetic is as divisive as it is fresh and inventive.
Freudian's could have a field day examining the obsession that Harry has with the size of his weaponry in this flaccid police thriller	Worth watching, just for THEE line.	Considering that Sudden Impact delivers one of the most memorable lines in movie history, it's surprising how forgettable the rest of it is.	To all those cowboy movies we saw in our youth, all those TV Westerns and cop dramas and war movies, Dirty Harry has brought a great simplification: A big man, a big gun, a bad guy and instant justice.	not one of Dirty Harry's better days	Sudden Impact delivers all the firepower -- and the most enduring catchphrase -- fans associate with the Dirty Harry franchise, but it's far from the best film in the series.
Doesn't mess with a good thing. That means many prankish penguins, loony lemurs and that "move it, move it" song, all over again.	If you weren't particularly enamored with the first one, chances are this isn't gonna change your opinion on the Madagascar cast	den eihe kamia idiaiteri istoria na proekteinei, oyte apaitiseis kanenos fan base na ikanopoiisei, opote logika, den prospathei na kanei tipote ap' ta dyo	[Sua] irreveręncia só (surge) realmente quando os personagens secundários seqüestram a história.	There's amusement in this jungle jumble but "Happy Feet" left me happier.	Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is an improvement on the original, with more fleshed-out characters, crisper animation and more consistent humor.
I wanted "The Butterfly Effect" to end long before the completion of its near two-hour run time.	The whole movie is a stain, or a blot, or just an absurd mistake.	Cool theories...don't necessarily guarantee good stories...[even if Ashton Kutcher] is repeatedly punk'd by the space-time continuum.	Style takes precedence over substance, special effects over smart scripting, and jumpy scares over solid theatrics.	a twisted tale that incorporates child pornography, a dog being set aflame, a mother and baby being blown to smithereens by an exploding mailbox...oppressively unpleasant	The premise is intriguing, but it's placed in the service of an overwrought and tasteless thriller.
It is a work of art created by grown people for grown people.	Welles's deeply haunting depiction of the life of William Randolph Hearst has long been synonymous with the director's spectacularly odd and genuinely tragic career.	In addition to being the first great independent movie, Citizen Kane is the first great character drama.	This is the inherent paradox of Welles' film: that its ending should be so equivocal, providing a satisfying resolution that simultaneously scoffs at such over-simplification.	Orson Welles' epic film, his stunning feature debut from 1941, is an enduring masterpiece that was underestimated at the time of its release due to political reasons.	Orson Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in film.
There's real drama and pathos in the story, in the blend of matter-of-factness and potential catastrophe, in the depiction of innocence imperiled.	Despite the downbeat premise, the director focuses on his characters' momentary pleasures.	Just when you think you've figured out how you feel about its complex situations, director Hirokazu Kore-eda shows you something that makes you question your own conclusions.	Extraordinary.	Emotional truth and delicate visual cues distinguish a story so patiently naturalistic that the viewer will feel a part of this dysfunctional family.	Tragic and haunting, a beautifully heart-wrenching portrait of child abandonment.
As a musical mischief maker who exuded endless existential ennui, Serge's complexity is just too ungainly for any one biopic - but G:AHL is great starter kit.	Gainsbourg is a noble attempt and interesting enough to keep you watching, but it's bound to disappoint fans of the singer's and possibly will confuse any newcomer to the story.	Very nearly as inventive and fascinating as it is frustrating.	It's the story of a genius with no moral sense and no interests beyond sensuality. The catchy, insinuating music can only carry you so far.	Sfar is a little too in love with his subject, so it's just as well that Eric Elmosnino excels in the lead role.	It might be thinly written and messily made, but Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life is also appropriately glamorous and intense -- and powerfully led by a gripping performance from Erik Elmosnino.
The movie is all over the place, jumping around in time, place and tone.	The little ones might laugh, but the adults will be bored.	Holes is a rarity among kids' movies: It's dark, complex, intelligent and well-acted.	A wayward charmer.	The intention is a good one, but the blending of disparate ingredients under Andrew Davis' direction is often jarring.	Faithful to its literary source, this is imaginative, intelligent family entertainment.
Laughably bad and fantastically good all at once, this is a guilty pleasure that everyone can enjoy.	A respectable time-waster.	An irrelevant campy sci-fier.	One of the great "bad" movies of the decade.	Camped up and wrong headed in the extreme.	Campy charm and a knowing sense of humor help to overcome a silly plot involving a spacefaring ex-football player, his adoring bevy of groupies, and a supervillain named Ming the Merciless.
One of the most faithful film adaptations not only in terms of substance, but also style.	More headache than head trip.	Unless viewed through the prism of psychedelic habituates, it is unlikely audiences will find much to savour in Gilliam's picture.	The fear is comical; the loathing almost nonexistent.	A film of brilliant moments, but sadly less coherent - and, on senses, rather less personal - than most of Gilliam's work.	Visually creative, but also aimless, repetitve, and devoid of character development.
Comic desperation can be seen at alarmingly frequent intervals.	Director Paul Weiland and the three (!) screenwriters it took to boil down thousands of bad movies into 101 minutes haven't provided this one with a single original thought.	Made of Honour, as well as flaunting one of the most useless titular puns in the history of cinema, is rubbish.	Made of Honor is a retread -- My Best Friend's Wedding with the genders reversed and the brains removed. Chick flicks this calculated should come with enough Scorpion Bowls to numb the pain.	The movie, like its stars, is not without its charm. It just would have been nice to be delighted by an unexpected flash of humor or feel the slightest bit of suspense about the resolution.	Sharp performances by Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan can't save this forgettable, formulaic chick flick from its comic failings.
There is an inertia born of ceaseless, stupefying animation.	G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is as polished and entertaining as war-mongering toy commercials get.	Sommers seems to be operating under what he perceives as a pact between himself and his 11-year-old fanbase, to simply provide them with as much awesome **** as he's allowed to shovel at the screen.	The real reason Paramount Pictures didn't screen "G.I. Joe" for critics: they were afraid of reviews like this one.	It's just as you would expect: poorly acted, conventionally written and occasionally fun.	While fans of the Hasbro toy franchise may revel in a bit of nostalgia, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is largely a cartoonish, over-the-top action fest propelled by silly writing, inconsistent visual effects, and merely passable performances.
Indie films about arrested adolescence have practically become a genre, but the way Jacobs avoids pat explanations...is so refreshingly low-key that it's easy to feel like Jacobs has reinvented the wheel.	Perhaps the most indispensable cast member, however, is the Jacobs' dwelling, their residence since 1966.	It's time to stop calling Azazel Jacobs a 'promising' filmmaker. With Momma's Man, Jacobs achieves the promise.	On the surface, it's a straightforward low-budget tale about a grown man who visits his parents and refuses to leave. Yet deeper, darker currents move through Momma's Man, eddying around fears of letting go on both sides of the generational divide.	After a summer full of movies that celebrate the arrested development of their male characters, that titter and wink while grown men behave like teenagers, Momma's Man is a welcome palette cleanser.	Moody yet touching, Momma's Man successfully illustrates with elegant simplicity the struggles of a man consumed with his adolescence.
Kristen Stewart is allowed to make the most of her slightly bored, slightly agitated alto, rattling off a neverending stream of job offers and plans with cucumber cool.	Assayas writes/directs this film in his typical cerebral style. Every scene is deliberate, every action premeditated, and every visual reference requires further examination.	Director Olivier Assayas is one step ahead of the audience the whole time.	A slippery, enigmatic and altogether mesmerizing film about the passage of time, and the way our ideas about art evolve according to our life experiences.	It's slight and enjoyable, but falters a bit as it strains for profundity.	Bolstered by a trio of powerful performances from its talented leads, Clouds of Sils Maria is an absorbing, richly detailed drama with impressive depth and intelligence.
Killer of Sheep has the soul of the best Richard Pryor routines, the surging power of old blues and the overall lilt of a bedtime story.	Has that marvelous capacity among motion pictures: it sneaks up on you.	... a seminal American feature ...	Using the word art may seem like a lazy label, but it is shorthand for a beauty and a peculiar magic that has to be experienced first-hand to be understood.	Burnett is particularly adept at capturing children's play, how imagination supercedes material possession.	By turns funny, sad, and profound, Killer of Sheep offers a sympathetic and humane glimpse into inner-city life.
[A] deft period farce, his most enjoyable movie in years.	Dianne Wiest elevates even the most esoteric argument in the film to a level of sublime entertainment.	One of Allen's best and most revealing comedies, as much a moral meditation as it is dazzling fun.	The movie is very funny and, in the way it follows its logic wherever it leads, surprisingly tough.	You can watch Bullets Over Broadway with the sound off and have a thrilling time. You can listen to it from the next room and achieve total bliss.	A gleefully entertaining backstage comedy, Bullets Over Broadway features some of Woody Allen's sharpest, most inspired late-period writing and direction.
A fascinating, funny and cautionary look at how a world of group hugs and high fives transforms into night sweats and icy stares.	A gripping study of human nature and a prime example of why business and friendship don't mix	The story of a friendship tested to the breaking point is timeless.	One of the great strengths of the story is the way in which a group of people from very diverse backgrounds and cultures works together with great loyalty and commitment.	With newcomer Noujaim (who was a Harvard roommate of Tuzman), they once again pull off a coup in what is essentially an art of creative noticing.	Startup.com is more than just a look at the rise and fall of the new economy. At its center is a friendship being tested to the limit, and that's what makes it worth viewing.
See Standard Operating Procedure for its riveting narrative, for the way it keeps looping back -- to the swirls of Danny Elfman's night music -- to the basement of Abu Ghraib.	By returning to the pictures over and over again, Morris shows the power of the photos, how the visual record became the only evidence that carried any power in the media...	Standard Operating Procedure is a brilliantly, almost self-consciously, stylish film.	...at times it veers dangerously close to being just another solipsistic horror show, another magic trick in which absolution is achieved through ordinariness.	Even with an amazing filmmaker like Morris, it's impossible to yet fully focus the photos from Abu Ghraib and truly know what happened, who was right, who was wrong, and when it will happen again.	Well researched and finely crafted, Standard Operating Procedure is another gem from master documentarian Errol Morris.
Aside from The Nutty Professor, this is the funniest Eddie Murphy comedy since the Reagan administration.	Bowfinger manages to be funny without a single semen or shit joke or scene in which a character has carnal relations with a dessert.	Bowfinger hits the comedy jackpot!	The comedy you've been waiting for all summer!	Frivolous, wispy and quite disposable, this is cinematic cotton candy, which is not necessarily a bad thing.	A witty commentary on modern film-making, with enough jokes to keep it entertaining throughout.
At once heartbreaking and inspirational.	It is wonderful to watch this joyous slice of the cultural lives of these victimized, traumatized children struggling to survive and build a better life in a desperately troubled part of the world.	Directors Sean and Andrea Fine have set out to make an inspirational film about the transcendent power of music in a war zone. What they have achieved is a piece of emotional pornography.	An emotionally-engaging testament to the indomitability of the human spirit even in the midst of the most dire of circumstances.	The filmmaking style is annoyingly slick, but the testimonies of these children are excruciatingly moving.	War/Dance is beautifully filmed, and effectively captures the heartbreaking and uplifting experiences of its subjects.
This film is shot full of holes.	The youngster has the temerity to pronounce, "I'm kickin' your freaky *** back to wherever the hell it came from." This is Chow Yun-Fat he's talking to.	The bottom line is, this qualifies as a guilty pleasure.	Everything here is borrowed from other movies ...	The odd-couple chemistry between Chow and Scott carries the film until the unimaginative buddy formula wears thin.	Venerable action star Chow Yun-Fat is the only saving grace in this silly action flick that more often than not resembles a commercial in style.
It's a touching, humorous take on Jewish life in contemporary Argentina, and a grown man who's still unable to forgive the father who abandoned his family shortly after his son was born.	Burman explored this world before in 2000's Waiting for the Messiah, but in Lost Embrace, his maturity results in a much tighter and engaging film.	One of those foreign pictures that steeps us in a milieu so dense, yet so convincing, that we wind up believing and being beguiled by all its people and places.	The film's sophistication -- and it is an immensely sophisticated film -- lies in its refusal to tuck in too tightly its shirttails.	It's a sweet, funny movie with just enough substance to make it better than the average quirky comedy.	A low-key but charming tale that will put a smile on your face.
Esteemed Brazilian director Walter Salles ("The Motorcycle Diaries") falls flat on his face on his first Hollywood outing with a horror movie that will bore you to tears.	[T]he relentless psychological desolation that rumbles ominously throughout is unique, and elevates it above most of the genre.	Until it sputters to a nonsensical close, the film is a spooky entertainment.	Dark Water is a failure as a horror movie.	[E]xecuted just about as well as it possibly could be ... 'Dark Water' sinks under the weight of its rampant and ... laughable predictability.	All the atmospherics in Dark Water can't make up for the lack of genuine scares.
A film with a few inspired moments - mostly towards the end - sprinkled in with a whole lot of awkward, even mean, portions. The result is a major disappointment.	Begins as merely intolerable and ends up borderline-reprehensible.	It takes some effort to neutralize the charm of a modestly charismatic Robert De Niro performance. But Everybody's Fine does a stupendous job.	Ultimately, Everybody's Fine becomes a holiday movie of rare sweetness; one likely to inspire a few calls home to Mom or Dad.	A phony premise made tolerable only by the efforts of a strong cast.	A calm, charismatic performance from Robert De Niro nearly saves the movie, but ultimately, Everybody's Fine has the look and feel of a stereotypical Christmas dramedy.
the ultimate expression of Wong's sinuous vision and perhaps a goodbye to it	It may help if you grasp the many allusions to Wong's earlier films (including, notably, Days of Being Wild), but it's far from necessary. This, after all, is undeniably real cinema.	For all its balance and grandeur, 2046 is the most nervous of Wong's films.	If only the movie's pace were a little quicker, its compositions a little less studied -- and those sci-fi interruptions simply missing -- 2046 would be perfect.	This vortex of déjŕ vu, fantasy and regret is about Chow rewriting his memories so that his romance is an endless elegy for love that could have been . . . visually rapturous.	Director Wong Kar-Wai has created in 2046 another visually stunning, atmospheric, and melancholy movie about unrequited love and loneliness.
Corsini has her surprises. And she has Scott Thomas, and that's really all she needs.	For a triangular tale with a familiar premise, this compact feature, which was written by the director with Gaëlle Macé, proves to be uncommonly interesting.	The relationship might not be believable but you believe Kristin believes in it. And as far as the film's concerned, that's enough to rescue it.	The performances and Agnes Godard's cinematography ensure that this is a very elegant piece of trash.	Yet, despite its many shortcomings, the film remains watchable and entertaining.	Laden with melodramatic clichés, Leaving needed a talented star to succeed -- and Kristin Scott Thomas delivers the goods with another superb performance.
Style (and the uber-creepy performance by Casey Affleck) inject the film with an energy and tension that almost compensate for its flaws.	The Killer Inside Me is hard to watch -- occasionally impossible to watch -- but it never looks away from the hard, isolate, stoic killer at its dark heart, and it makes sure we can't either.	It comes across like a remake of Russ Meyer's immortal "Supervixens" made by people who have inexplicably chosen to play it both straight and at the wrong speed.	Winterbottom's harsh, naturalistic approach pretty much kills any dramatic momentum or tension by exposing the mechanics of Thompson's pulpy plotting for what it is and failing to compensate with any real psychological insights.	Winterbottom is better envisioning Killer Inside Me than he is executing it, surrendering a magnificently photographed picture of hot noir blood, but spoiling the tone by remaining so aloof and ineffective.	The Killer Inside Me is stylish and beautifully shot, but Michael Winterbottom's distance from his characters robs this often brutally violent film of crucial emotional context.
It's a really interesting story, but I think it's just too black and white.	No matter what side you end up taking, you still might be tempted to call your lawyer to go over your will just one more time.	Don Argott's new documentary makes some of the most outlandish conspiracy theories seem strangely believable.	While The Art of the Steal makes a very convincing -- even bone-chilling -- argument... the film fails to even ponder why easier access to some of the world's greatest art treasures might not be an entirely bad thing.	This insider look at art world shenanigans and politicking is both fascinating and scandalous.	Deeply esoteric and unapologetically one-sided, The Art of the Steal proves a documentary doesn't have to make an objective argument as long as it argues well.
You don't have to be an NPR junkie to appreciate Garrison Keillor and Robert Altman's sweet, gently funny tale about an old-fashioned radio show taking its last bow.	Oh where oh where has Lake Wobegon gone? Oh where oh where could it be? This mythical place is the heart and soul of pretty much everything Garrison Keillor has done in the last three decades. It's not there!!!! AAAAAAAAAARG!!!!	Even with its feisty, anti-corporate sympathies, this movie adaptation of Garrison Keillor's beloved Midwestern radio drollery is a breezy affair.	By the movie's own reckoning, it's a success: a dented, mysterious item that you would find buried in a secondhand store -- a relic of the old, weird America that Keillor so loves.	Keillor has managed to tamper with his homegrown formula in ways that will put the casual viewer to sleep and perhaps confuse his fervent fanbase to a point of complete disinterest.	The final film by the great Robert Altman, A Prairie Home Companion, the big screen adaptation of Garrison Keillor's radio broadcast, showcases plenty of the director's strengths: it's got a gigantic cast and plenty of quirky acting and dialogue. Much like the radio show, Companion features clever jokes, rousing tunes, and endearing characters. With strong work from Lindsay Lohan, Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Tommy Lee Jones, it's a worthy swan song from one of the cinema's best.
For all the Amblin technology on display, Dante's greatest effects are humanistic	Innerspace is high-concept all the way, but if all such 'high-concept' movies were crafted with this much affection and good humour, then lots of movie critics would be out of jobs/	An underrated comic masterpiece from the talented director Joe Dante.	While the sci-fi is pretty hard to fault for what it is, and the adventure is aces for a high-concept 1980s family movie, the comedy is awfully wan and reedy.	The picture's haphazardness lends itself to being appreciated.	A manic, overstuffed blend of sci-fi, comedy, and romance, Innerspace nonetheless charms, thanks to Martin Short's fine performance and the insistent zaniness of the plot.
Overproduced, overdirected, overheated, but eye-catching.	A feast for the senses that fails to satisfy the heart, libido or mind.	Woozy, flamboyant, and unforgettable, Coppola makes grand mistakes but scores far grander successes.	Overblown, but entertaining.	With his over-the-top flourish and the campy attitude that literally runs amok, Coppola has come up with yet another high-priced film that is all style and no substance.	Overblown in the best sense of the word, Francis Ford Coppola's vision of Bram Stoker's Dracula rescues the character from decades of campy interpretations -- and features some terrific performances to boot.
Touching, even minor-key-tragic.	Time to get on the bus.	It's fascinating and sometimes surprising stuff.	The film is at it's best as a time capsule of a particular time, a brief golden age in America, and a particular event, Kesey's cross-country voyage of discovery.	Bright experiences stand out amid the general tedium of this road-and-buddy movie.	Magic Trip is overall unenlightening, though there's an inherent novelty and joy in seeing the unearthed footage of Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters.
What the excitement was about was the unspoken belief that this film would put a cap on the most exciting decade in American film, that it would sum up everything that had come before and influence everything that came after...	Disturbing tale of war horrors isn't for kids.	This is still magnificent filmmaking and story-telling on every level. Apocalypse Now is one of the great films because it is about every war ever fought and at the same time is about much more than men in combat.	Apocalypse Now is as good as ever.	A real must-see and one hell of a ride.	Francis Ford Coppola's haunting, hallucinatory Vietnam War epic is cinema at its most audacious and visionary.
Naizgled solidna ljetna zabava prepuna spektakularnih akcijskih scena nepotrebno je zakomplicirana scenarističkim zahvatima	The A-Team overstays its welcome and misses the mark on too many occasions for it to fulfil its initial promise of consistent entertainment.	It is not awful just very, very ordinary.	I love it when a summer movie comes together.	Pretty much an archetypal example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood today. Was the show this dumb? Does it matter? A movie's job is not to live down to its source material.	For better and for worse, Joe Carnahan's big-screen version of The A-Team captures the superficial, noisy spirit of the TV series.
...anyone looking for logic in a movie titled Alien vs. Predator should have his or her head examined.	Joining two previously independent monsters in one film signals the same desperation a sitcom producer feels when he sends his cast to Hawaii for an hour-long "special."	Unwatchable!	This spectacle-fueled Sci-Fi thriller is all bark and no bite.	un divertissement estival parmi tant d'autre qui n'a absolument rien de mythique n'est pas pour autant désagréable si on le prend pour ce qu'il est	Gore without scares and cardboard cut-out characters make this clash of the monsters a dull sit.
Wes Craven's fourth installment in the "Scream" franchise is yet another scattershot postmodern comic play on the slasher sub-genre of horror. Still, it's an improvement on the disgraceful "Scream 3."	Scream's brand of horror, which lampooned the slasher genre while simultaneously embracing it, was fun and breezy in 1996. In 2011, it's about as fresh as the whiff of something stale and rank from a crypt.	The movie is at its best when it's mocking - rather hilariously - the shameful condition of cinematic slashers. But it comes at a price. All that comedy and meta self-awareness totally deflates any tension.	Fifteen years ago, I ended my Scream review by saying that the horror genre needed a new face. It now needs considerably more than that.	The filmmakers' subtext - at least in the movie's first quarter - seems to acknowledge that you can't top the original. And they didn't.	The franchise is showing its age, but Scream 4 is undeniably an improvement over its predecessor, with just enough meta humor and clever kills.
His [Ostlund] only failing is following an ending that shows Tomas' risky desperation to make amends with a coda that evens up the couple's ledger. It's the one contrived moment in an otherwise impressive film.	It's a sly tease, superbly written and performed. There's even odd humor. It's all set against gorgeously shot natural vistas.	...a sporadically engrossing yet perpetually erratic familial drama.	Acting is excellent, including the children, whose characters say little but radiate anxiety.	The "pleasure" of Östlund is in his command of silence and detail. A sigh or physical twitch says more than a line of dialogue, and what it says is more alarming and more provocative than anyone bargains for.	Gleefully uncomfortable, Force Majeure is a relationship drama that's hard to watch -- and just as difficult to ignore.
Like the art scene it documents, Beautiful Losers is chaotic, anarchic, rambling and populated by charismatic freaks with statement T-shirts, complicated haircuts and impossibly rare trainers.	[A] pleasant film, which sings the praises of nonconformity.	Regardless of Rose's intentions, his underachieving airiness is both entertaining and perfectly fitting for the slacker ennui of his clique's rising years.	An absorbing look at how a circle of dispossessed young artists from the 1990s eventually found its way to mainstream success.	Some of the art is probably interesting, but Rose's own video-influenced filmmaking style leaves little time for inspection or reflection.	An insightful if fawning documentary that explores a group of 90s NYC artists.
The whole enterprise is tired and exhausted and indifferent; even the title is irrelevant and dissembling.	Think of it as a mildly entertaining way to get out of the house this Christmas, rather than a cracker of a movie.	A mapped minefield of bad jokes.	Chapter 3 in the misadventures of Gaylord Focker is a slog through the same ol' gags and a reminder of how low Robert De Niro's standards have fallen.	The jokes are a bit randy, the situations and characters familiar, the touching moments false but fitting. It's all as formulaic as weak egg nog, but it goes down just as easy. Let's hope all involved spend their paychecks wisely.	As star-studded as it is heartbreakingly lazy, Little Fockers takes the top-grossing trilogy to embarrassing new lows.
Those who are patient enough to persevere through the seemingly endless rambling conversations will catch snippets of intelligent repartee that make the film interesting and worthwhile.	A Summer's Tale is vintage Eric Rohmer, his most richly satisfying film in a number of outings.	This is a movie of high innocence, set at a time in life when romantic love is still a frolic and the seaside is a balm that quells all ills.	Astute, unhurried and gently amusing, it will be welcomed by the director's fans while serving as a fine introduction for those who know him not.	It's the kind of vaguely philosophical travelogue/not-exactly-love story audiences are virtually guaranteed to find either exotically fascinating or utterly interminable.	With A Summer's Tale, Eric Rohmer continues his "Tales of the Four Seasons" in typically Rohmeresque fashion -- and for cineastes, that's excellent news indeed.
The Benchwarmers features a talking robot butler. If you're wondering what a talking robot butler has to do with Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Jon Heder playing baseball against children, the answer is: absolutely nothing.	What is Craig Kilborn doing in this movie?	It's so bad, it should be viewed only through a pinhole in a shoebox, much like an eclipse.	If there's a bad getting-hit-in-the-crotch gag, director Dennis Dugan hasn't seen it.	There's a reason this comedy was not screened for critics. It strikes out, except at Pizza hut which must be thrilled with its product placements.	A gross-out comedy that is more sophomoric than funny, The Benchwarmers goes down swinging.
The funniest mockumentary film since Best In Show.	The most important thing to know about What We Do In The Shadows is that it's laugh-out-loud hilarious and we urge you to see it as soon as possible.	One of the best comedies of the year. [full review in Spanish]	An endearingly dorky undead heart beats in this vampire mockumentary by two of the creators of HBO's "Flight of the Conchords."	Hilarious, with refreshing attention to the gruesome possibilities of the premise, "Shadows" is a creative step forward for Waititi, taking interesting tonal risks while maintaining a steady flow of silly business.	Smarter, fresher, and funnier than a modern vampire movie has any right to be, What We Do in the Shadows is bloody good fun.
Besides keeping us entertained and occasionally thrilled, there's a nice sense that the film is actually saying something.	It's a fun adventure fantasy, and I was never bored...	The Ant Bully exhibits little of the humanity that characterized Pixar's 1998 arthropod adventure A Bug's Life.	The Ant Bully, the latest computer-animated plea for interspecies understanding, provides a few moments of inventiveness and wit.	Like the insect world it depicts, The Ant Bully, based on John Nickle's book, is neatly structured and cohesive, but a little small-scale.	Sometimes inventive and witty, this animated adventure into an ant-sized world is a pleasant diversion.
The story is risible, the direction routine, the underlying ethic highly questionable; but the flying stirs the blood like speed.	The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film.	thrilling but far too rah-rah	An undeniably cheesy yet strangely appealing time capsule, with a little something for everyone provided we understand that it's all bubblegum.	You get about thirty minutes of good movie in Top Gun, and most of that comes at the end.	Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aereial footage shot with an expert eye for action, Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren't in the air.
Although its methodology raises some questions, The Road to Guantanamo provides a riveting glimpse into a heavily shrouded political and moral quagmire that deepens by the day.	Guided terror tour of US atrocity culture.	The Road to Guantánamo will drive you crazy, if you aren't crazy yet.	It's not enough to simply show what these men went through, we need to be made to understand it, something that The Road to Guantanamo is sadly unable to do.	If we ever felt like the soldiers and interrogators seen here were in any way human, Winterbottom and Whitecross' indictment of their behavior would hit twice as hard.	A gut-wrenching and riveting docu-drama that serves as a stinging indictment of U.S. military justice in an era of ever-increasing scrutiny.
There are a couple of laughs, but for me, it's a film that's mainly just going through the motions.	I think I am tiring of computer generated movies with 800 star voices and 800 real-world knock-offs like Katie Current and "Kelpy-Kremes."	Quite simply the most middle of the road CG movie I think you'll ever see.	I laughed quite a lot during this film.	The movie is clearly written and produced around the persona of Will Smith, which is either glorious news or cringe-inducing, depending upon who you are.	Derivative and full of pop culture in-jokes.
There are a few entertaining fight scenes. But there is also uneven CGI, bad dialogue and a host of clichéd moments that make Dragonball Evolution just another disappointing matinee movie.	Action packed and well paced, the film delivers exactly what it promises in terms of its style and quality effects and should appeal to the 15 to 24 crowd	Chintzy effects, badly overdubbed dialogue, an idiotic script and a cave set that looks exactly like the "caves" on log-flume rides.	Poor Emmy Rossum went from "Phantom" to this. Now that's a career decline.	Tearing through its mystical, who-gives-a-toss storyline like a pissed bat bouncing off cave walls, Dragonball's cocktail of cheap effects, eye-rolling cliches and dismal direlogue will have fans of the series condemning it as a beyond-lame failure.	Executed with little panache or invention, Dragonball Evolution lacks the magic that made the books upon which it was based a cult sensation.
So slick, so clever and so incredibly lucid that it neither leads to much in the way of thought, discussion or, unfortunately, repeat viewing.	Somehow ... this frail figure [George] is an immensely likable -- and, at times, deeply moving -- character.	Thankfully, most of the humor here works, but on the whole, the film falls to mediocrity.	For those who, like myself, were disappointed in the play, the film contains pleasant surprises, all of them resulting from differences between the two arts.	One of the unlikeliest but most likable movies of the 1990s.	Thanks largely to stellar all-around performances from a talented cast, The Madness of King George is a funny, entertaining, and immensely likable adaptation of the eponymous stage production.
Absolutely shattering.	I certainly do not move that the film should be suppressed, only that one should know what it is. It is a bath in a smiling madness.	I'll never forget the final ten minutes of this documentary. Film begins to take revenge.	A horrifying yet mesmerizing work, "The Act of Killing" instructively meanders at times as in a Werner Herzog film.	The Act of Killing allows the victors a forum to elaborate on their story, and, by their own hands, these aged conquerors unwittingly rewrite aspects of the history that has propped them up for so many decades.	Raw, terrifying, and painfully difficult to watch, The Act of Killing offers a haunting testament to the edifying, confrontational power of documentary cinema.
Casting here is very good, and it's what moves this tearjerker from the reject bin to the front racks.	Feels like the house George builds: finely crafted, but lacking that lived-in feel.	Life as a House may be too predictable, too familiar, but what's fresh here is the unwavering humanity demonstrated by the ensemble cast.	Let me just warn you - you will need a hanky. Who cares if it's a little too neatly done?	Nuanced characterizations by stellar performers	A manipulative tearjerker, Life as a House benefits from fine performances from the cast.
The longer this film drones ominously on, the more we realize that Pellington really doesn't know where he ought to be taking it.	One truly, madly, deeply satisfying creep-out.	Pellington is able to create a real palpable sense of tension despite the fact that very little ends up happening.	Tries to hide the fact that it's not telling us anything by distracting us with stupid smoke-and-mirror tactics	Ingenious thriller, which draws on urban legend to fashion a spooky supernatural yarn in the best traditions of The X-Files.	A creepy thriller that poses more questions than it answers.
The movie attempts a sort of documentary realism in depicting a period that is largely undocumented %u2026 but as was the case with the flat-footed King Arthur of two years ago, you may miss the magic.	Oh, their legend will survive. But this classic comics-style perfume commercial of a re-telling will not.	Across the board, it's far from special.	They are hollow people mooning their way through a backdrop of endless battles in which wild-haired, wild-eyed men chop each other about.	Filmed in breathtaking locations in Western Ireland and the Czech Republic, Tristan & Isolde is a disappointingly passion-free romance.	Competent but somewhat static, Tristan & Isolde doesn't achieve the sweeping romanticism that it aims for.
At its best when it is observing, and at its worst when it is trying desperately to Explore.	Rize sees LaChapelle turning into a historian-sociologist who feels excitement and wants to share it.	Rize does not so much report on a cultural phenomenon as package it.	Masterfully shows how these musical manifestations have provided African-Americans in the war zones of South Central a path away from the guns'n'poses of self-styled gangstas.	It's an incomplete film. We don't get to know these kids well enough.	The dances in Rize are electric even if the documentary doesn't go that deeply into the performers' lives.
An 'as-if' romantic adventure reunites How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days lovebirds Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson in a sun-soaked treasure hunt that squanders everybody's time, including yours.	This has nothing to offer that we haven't seen before, making it one of those winter offerings that will be long forgotten by the summer.	... the two likable leads sink together in Fool's Gold, a leaden action adventure about treasure hunters.	The fools, it turns out, are audience members who get duped into thinking this will be a fun, energetic romp.	This movie is a lot like going on vacation and only eating at chain restaurants: familiar and bland, despite the beautiful surroundings.	With little chemistry among the performers, humorless gags, and a predictable storyline, Fool's Gold fails on every level.
Despite moments of genuine intensity, the film is still hampered by weak character development, sloppy editing, and an inferior script.	Throughout the movie I could imagine Annaud, metaphorically speaking, on the brink of shooting himself and his movie in the head. It was nice that he only would up shooting himself, and Enemy at the Gates, in the foot.	The plot is pure Hollywood bunk.	A movie that's likely to be its own worst enemy once audiences come into its cross hairs.	After Enemy at the Gates teases us with the promise of something big, it's hard to be happy with a small-scale story.	Atmospheric and thrilling, Enemy at the Gates gets the look and feel of war right. However, the love story seems out of place.
Graced by Davis and enlivened by Lovitz and the ensemble cast, it sends us home feeling a little higher, with visions of peanuts and Cracker Jack floating in our heads.	Scriptwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel neglect the ensemble, emphasising a sense of historical occasion over character development.	Terrific tweens-and-up story of women's baseball.	Marshall's methods overwhelm the material, and what emerges is a movie utterly without personality. A unique chapter in American history becomes a movie as ordinary as they come.	Considerable money and effort was lavished on this production, but problems in the script diminish the effort.	Sentimental and light, but still thoroughly charming, A League of Their Own is buoyed by solid performances from a wonderful cast.
a survivor story set against a historical background writ from the movie screen	It's as dull as dry dirt.	If [Potter] personally, in her 40s, can go to Argentina and become a tango dancer, then we can't complain about anything that happens to Suzie. Not that we'd want to.	Has a good story; a lush, tantalizing style and tone; and an excellent cast.	Always interesting in a morbid and curious sort of way.	The storyline is overwrought and awkward, and the audience is distanced from the flatly drawn characters.
Warren Beatty delivers some of his best acting in years as Bugsy Siegel, the gangster responsible for the inception of Las Vegas as we now know it.	classy and fascinating	Beatty and Annette Bening charge their roles with energy, and the supporting cast includes such talents as Harvey Keitel, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, and Elliott Gould in sturdy performances.	Bugsy Siegel is a fascinating character.	The disclosure at that Bugsy's $6 million investment in the young city generated over $100 billion might encourage different interpretations: Is Vegas the capital of the American Dream, or the embodiment of crass consumerism?	Stylishly scattered, Bugsy offers cinematic homage to the infamous underworld legend, chiefly through a magnetic performance from Warren Beatty in the title role.
Directed with great intelligence, sensitivity and restraint by Marc Forster.	The film's tale is told so well and the performances are so on key that everything feels fresh.	As the film progresses it becomes clear that, like a dance, Forster's film is predicated on machination but distinguished by grace.	A fine film that packs enormous ambition into a modest, carefully executed package.	The acting is so good in Monster's Ball, and the understated but intense mood so skillfully maintained, that we tend to overlook the story's contrivances.	Somber and thought provoking, Monster's Ball has great performances all around.
Has no story, no ending and no redeeming value.	Strange and a little awkward, "Secret Window" nonetheless is worth a look.	Naturally, the less said about the spooks themselves, the better.	Depp's ... wonderfully frazzled portrait of seething resentment almost makes this minor thriller seem fresh.	Writer-Director Koepp well understood the best qualities of the story and held back the almost demeaning payoff as long as he could.	Depp is quirkily entertaining, but the movie runs out of steam by the end.
See the Holocaust trivialized, glossed over, kitsched up, commercially exploited and hijacked for a tragedy about a Nazi family. Better yet and in all sincerity: don't.	A tale older than Scripture and as today as war and genocide, this different Holocaust film contrasts love to hatred, good to evil, children to adults.	The film's flimsy fabric of historical reimagining - a death camp with no watchtower and an out-of-sight corner for illicit pow-wows and tunnel-digging - makes the notionally harrowing ending seem a smash-and-grab raid on our susceptibilities.	Either you will appreciate The Boy in the Striped Pajamas particular tact, or you will cringe on what it decides to exploit. Like the subject it secures as part of its plotting, there is no middle ground.	Contemptible awards-bait... The Holocaust deserves far more than this prim Masterpiece Theater treatment.	A touching and haunting family film that deals with the Holocaust in an arresting and unusual manner, and packs a brutal final punch of a twist.
Space ships are cool, especially when you're six. And a boy.	What makes the fantasy elements seem particularly colorful is that the film immediately grounds the characters in reality.	Thin on plot, skimpy on emotion, big on special effects.	Most of the film's 101 minutes is an onslaught of explosions, attacks, escapes and infighting.	A beautiful film, a return to movie-making craftsmanship that's gone by the wayside in a wave of cubicle nerds carelessly rendering spaceships on their Apple computers.	Dazzling special effects for the kids + well-crafted storytelling for the 'rents = cinematic satisfaction for the whole family.
Hitchcock's second masterpiece (after Shadow of a Doubt) is a richly dense meditation on romantic love, featuring exquisite performances by Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant.	Second only to Psycho as my favorite Hitchcock movie.	It's the accuracy, efficiency and control of Hitchcock's direction that most impress. They enable him to dovetail the film's thriller format and romantic story to dizzying, expressive and unique effect.	Romantic melodrama. If contemporary viewers think of "Notorious" in those terms, it will still strike them as the classic it's become.	If Rear Window was brilliant because of how deep it was, and Vertigo was brilliant for how existential it was, Notorious is brilliant because of how simple it is.	Sublime direction from Hitchcock, and terrific central performances from Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant make this a bona-fide classic worthy of a re-visit.
A bracing, mesmerizing, bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable.	A shrewd, scintillating work rooted in an investigation of varying degrees of masculinity and extremism.	...an incredibly brutal and pretentious film ostensibly about alienation in a modern desensitized world, a black comedy that entertains only on the most superficial level.	...more clever and kinetic than it is profound, more a visceral movie than a think piece.	Fight Club jettisons its sense of humour 60 minutes in, and, so far from satirising the tiresome "crisis of masculinity" stuff sloshing around the airwaves either side of the Atlantic, the film simply endorses it.	Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride.
[Branagh] has found his way to the play's profound yet populist heart, rediscovering Shakespeare's vision of romantic fulfillment - celebration with an underlying tug of sadness - for an era that believes itself all too wise to the ways of love.	The good news is that the audience will have just as much fun as the players with this one.	You can not fault Branagh's enthusiasm and his successful campaign to bring the Bard to the masses.	A spirited, winningly acted rendition of one of the Bard's most popular comedies.	This film is going to entertain even those viewers who care little about Shakespeare and care about his comedies even less.	Kenneth Branagh's love for the material is contagious in this exuberant adaptation.
The kind of glorious sensory rush that you can only get when a supremely confident director fully kicks out the jams. Submerged within the flash, however, is a nihilistic worldview that may be even more curdled than its predecessors.	The freshness and ingenuity of Oldboy has been replaced with the kind of lazy self-satisfaction that often comes when a unique filmmaker unexpectedly achieves worldwide success and isn't quite sure of how to handle it.	The first hour will test the patience of all but diehard fans of the genre, flipping randomly through time before things settle down for a final 50 minutes examining the ethics of revenge.	Looks may not be able to kill, but boredom can sure do the job.	With Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, Park Chanwook delivers more virtuosic but empty flash.	Stylistically flashy and gruesomely violent, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance fits in nicely with the other two films of Park's revenge trilogy.
One of Hitchcock's most accessible films is also one of his most gleefully deviant, dealing as it does with such fun urban pastimes as voyeurism and spousal mayhem.	As close to 'perfect' as a film is likely to get.	Interesting and fun from the start.	An intriguing, brilliant Hitchcockian macabre visual study of obsessive human curiosity and voyeurism.	It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's inspired audience-participation films: watching it, you feel titillated, horrified, and, ultimately, purged.	Hitchcock exerted full potential of suspense in this masterpiece.
Who better than Denzel to play a saint in a sinful world, a man who retains this saintliness even after he's sliced up several dozen rapists and cannibals?	I'm not going to give it away, but there's a final plot twist in this movie that is beyond absurd.	The fixation on the Bible (and biblical-scale cloud formations) gets awfully pompous at times, especially when it's used to justify gory dismemberments.	think of this as The Road if re-imagined by the Wachowski Brothers. The landscape is all grays and browns, punctuated only by the occasional flash of a muzzle.	In its limpid simplicity and stock portrayals of good and evil characters, it has a forward momentum that's compelling.	It's certainly uneven, and many viewers will find that its reach exceeds its grasp, but The Book of Eli finds the Hughes brothers injecting some fresh stylish fun into the kind of post-apocalyptic wasteland filmgoers have seen more than enough of lately.
It's certainly a far better thriller than anything Hollywood has churned out lately.	Stirring and inspiring.	Novelists like to say that fiction captures quiet truths nonfiction simply can't. Touching the Void offers up a powerful counterargument.	First you get to see some amazing climbing footage, then you experience an ordeal that is hard to believe even after seeing it happen. What a powerful story.	A tense, well-made tale about excruciating experiences.	Gripping even though the outcome is known.
A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole.	Peter O'Toole delivers an Oscar-worthy performance that is alternately hilarious and poignant.	O'Toole gives a magnificent old-lion performance...in a role that allows both subtlety and theatrical vigor.	It may be Peter O'Toole's last truly grand performance.	Venus director Roger Michell is not above holding the movie out as O'Toole's swan song, but the movie is so obscenity-laced, so unsentimental (shot in harsh natural light), that it never feels too manipulative.	Audiences may attend to witness Peter O'Toole's Oscar-worthy performance, but they'll also be treated to a humane, tender exploration of maturing with both dignity and irreverence.
Whoever thought remaking Fatal Attraction as a PG-13 thriller was a good idea earns much of the blame for this laughably arch dud.	It's strictly a generic thriller, perhaps the 105th blatant rip-off of 'Fatal Attraction', but not without its own guilty pleasures.	Obsessed is a safe, dull morality play. The most that can be said on its behalf is that, unlike Fatal Attraction, no bunnies were boiled in the picture.	This biracial entry in the psycho-bitch stalker sweepstakes is inept and stupid but not without its base pleasures.	If you know the title, you know everything you're going to learn about the movie.	The inevitable Fatal Attraction comparisons aside, Obsessed is a generic, toothless thriller both instantly predictable and instantly forgettable.
Wry, observant and frequently heartbreaking.	Yet another dysfunctional-family, holiday-reunion film that's no better, no worse than its bourgeois predecessors - unless you happen to be a Francophile.	To tweak Tolstoy: All happy families may be alike, but all unhappy-family movies are entertaining in their own ways.	It leaves no lasting impression, except for one excruciating scene involving a bone marrow transplant.	A compellingly literate exploration of the muddle of misguided motives and lingering regrets that bind families together.	A sharp black comedy about a chaotic family holiday gathering, A Christmas Tale is always involving, thanks to an impressive ensemble cast.
A truly indelible film that leaves you wondering just what the hell will happen next, and why it's happening at all.	Riding the perverse line between bizarre, awkward and darkly funny, this award-winning film follows the strange antics of three siblings brought up by their misguided parents in complete isolation from the rest of the world.	A miserable, consistently worthless piece of work...	A kind of ingenious horror show you just can't take your eyes off of.	The father is the only one who can leave the house to go to his factory job, and that seems like a paradise for viewers trapped watching this clinically shot claptrap.	It'll be too disturbing -- and meandering -- for some, but Dogtooth is as disturbing and startlingly original as modern filmmaking gets.
The Roger Moore Bond days are drawing to close, as this weak entry shows.	James Bond is old. Wrinkled-forehead old. Lecherous-coot old. Strategic-hairstyle old. Senior meal-discount old. Simply ... old. That's the biggest takeaway from Roger Moore's second-worst outing as 007, hot on the heels of his second-best.	A fun little Bond flick	Film's high points are the spectaccular aerial stuntwork marking both the pre-credits teaser and extremely dangerous-looking climax.	There's a fine line between wit and absurdity, and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong side.	Despite a couple of electrifying action sequences, Octopussy is a formulaic, anachronistic Bond outing.
Epps and Lathan are terrifically appealing, each giving a complex performance that benefits greatly from the chemistry between them.	Epps and Lathan share MVP honors with their novice director, as Love and Basketball chalks up a 'W.'	A breath of fresh air.	Reveals in appealing ways just how important friendship is romantic relationships.	The movie is not as taut as it could have been, but I prefer its emotional perception to the pumped-up sports cliches I was sort of expecting.	Confident directing and acting deliver an insightful look at young athletes.
It is a worthy start to a trilogy and to a director who is fast establishing himself as a new light in Asian cinema.	Confirms Park's mastery of a niche style of cinema that is glossy, morbid and childishly provocative.	The best way to describe it is as the work of an artist -- director Chanwook Park -- who possesses both a conscience and a burning desire to use images to tell stories.	hideously grim, and also oddly beautiful	Park's juvenile obsession with blatant gross-outs belies his many talents.	Though Park directs with stylistic flair, this revenge thriller is more excessively gruesome than thrilling.
The Pirates! has so much loving attention invested in it, and there is a lot of naughty fun to be had.	Offers fewer innuendos about 'sparkling booty' than might be found in an American animated effort or a Kim Kardashian mall appearance. [Still], my timbers remain unshivered.	Swashbuckling, family-friendly frolic on the high seas, subtly referencing evolutionary science with an insidious spoonful-of-sugar.	There's comic treasure in this animated feature	The Pirates! no doubt will play well to the whole family and with such enchanting visuals and astonishing attention to detail there's still much to treasure here.	It may not quite scale Aardman's customary delirious heights, but The Pirates! still represents some of the smartest, most skillfully animated fare that modern cinema has to offer.
There's no shortage of innuendo, action, exotic locations, or casual misogyny. Unfortunately it's too camp and cruel an adventure to raise more than a Moore-like eyebrow.	Weak but Christopher Lee is great	Roger Moore is a pastry chef's idea of James Bond; but Christopher Lee as the archetype of the evil antagonist makes this 007 outing just about bearable.	The Man with the Golden Gun certainly isn't worth $1 million, but it's fine for the price of a video rental.	Why did a tale that could've been a bit ragged - and a nice stretch for Moore - become simply a so-so romp? Chalk it up to the franchise's nervous need to capitalize on other genres' zeitgeist -first, blaxploitation, and here, martial arts.	A middling Bond film, The Man With the Golden Gun suffers from double entendre-laden dialogue, a noteworthy lack of gadgets, and a villain that overshadows 007.
...a vivid, thoughtful, unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.	Manages to be comic, dramatic, erotic, sociological and even political, all without breaking a sweat.	As playful and politically scatterbrained as Truffaut's overrated Jules and Jim, Tambien has the raunchier upper hand.	A fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor, sensuality, and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys.	Uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict, adolescent yearning, the roots of friendship and sexual identity.	A road movie that's not only sexy, but intelligent as well.
Beyond any real creative aspirations, Good Boy! is a movie for dog lovers.	It's ingratiating in that nice doggie way, but the dogs, who have had their lips enhanced via CGI to aid in the illusion of speech, don't have much more on their minds than where the next stick is going to sail in from.	Pales when placed next to all the similar movies it is shamelessly derivative of.	Doesn't add much to the oft-told story of a boy and his dog, and it never establishes the rules of the dogs-in-space myth it creates, but it is perked up by the gentle intelligence of writer/director John Hoffman.	...folks will be barking up the wrong tree if they were to consider this pooch picture an escapist treat for impressionable minds...Good Boy! is nothing but a bland knockoff of Spielberg's E.T.	Good Boy! should appeal to kids. Adults, however, might consider it a dog.
A griping documentary following several ballet hopefuls as they prepare for an international competition.	When it's over, you won't remember so much about who won and who lost. Instead, what remains is the expression on a young dancer's face, reflected in a mirror: showing the joy of being in love with what you do.	Kargman ... brings a welcome empathy to this programmatic film that follows six hopefuls as they compete in something called the Youth America Grand Prix, which we're told is the most comprehensive ballet competition in the world.	An appealing, largely upbeat documentary about young ballet dancers duking it out, sometimes on point and in tulle, for top honors at the Youth America Grand Prix.	These performers are so young, so serious, so full of dreams and so hard on themselves that it is difficult not to be moved by their striving.	An upbeat and visually dramatic documentary of children's ballet, First Position displays the potential of the human spirit when fostered at a young age.
The chemistry between Portman and Sarandon is off - they seem more like mismatched roommates than mother and daughter.	Inspired pairing of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as an outrageous mother and her more practical daughter.	Portman's performance is wrenching and powerful, as one by one Ann's chances for a "normal" life slip away.	The delicate script by two-time Oscar-winner Alvin Sargent never stumbles into even a single false beat and gives us dialogue that's consistently literate, revealing and witty.	Solid story of independence for teens.	The strong chemistry between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as a mother and daughter trying to make a fresh start in L.A. helps to elevate Anywhere But Here above its occasional forays into melodrama.
Flight of the Navigator, in spite of a rough beginning, soars as it should, taking a child on the journey of his life.	Innocuously entertaining...	At times a bit too precious, especially inside the young navigator's spacecraft, but the warm regard for character, as well as for our often-inhospitable planetary home, makes for a reasonably good time.	Weirdly entertaining kiddie space adventure.	Never brave enough to feel far-reaching (or, ironically, far-fetched, when time-travel and space flight are so popular at the movies), Navigator still fulfills its mission, distracting the family for bang-on an hour and a half.	Bolstered by impressive special effects and a charming performance from its young star, Flight of the Navigator holds up as a solidly entertaining bit of family-friendly sci-fi.
The acting is top notch.	One of [Woody Allen's] greatest films.	It's fun to watch, interesting to hear, and revelatory to discuss.	Smart, sensitive and packed with quality performances.	Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives is a very fine, sometimes brutal comedy about a small group of contemporary New Yorkers.	Husbands and Wives is a blistering, emotionally raw snapshot of two marriages self-destructing.
Takes the well-traveled concert film to exhilarating new heights.	The 3-D effects not only make you feel that Bono and crew are within arm's reach, but also -- this is a new trick -- layer the pictures to simulate shifting your focus from foreground to background.	While U2 3D delivers what it promises to, it doesn't do anything further.	U2 3D is an isle of style and sense in a sea of mediocrity.	The performances, culled from seven shows on the "Vertigo" tour from Mexico City to Buenos Aires, burn with the old unforgettable fire.	3D transports the viewer to an intimate seat at a U2 performance, for an exhilarating musical experience at the price of a movie ticket.
Heaven knows how many years in purgatory I may rack up for admitting this, but the movie is actually pretty funny.	Just another juvenile Sandler comedy -- and one with relatively few laughs at that.	The problem with Little Nicky is that it is a comedy without humor.	Maybe Adam Sandler really has some familial connections with the Devil.	A few more laughs wouldn't have hurt.	Despite the presence of a large, talented cast, the jokes in Little Nicky are dumb, tasteless, and not that funny, and Adam Sandler's character is grating to watch.
A poignant portrait of an inveterate iconoclast who couldn't help but push the envelope.	Vivid, delicious trip through the heyday of fashion mags is a must for followers of clothes, print design, and high society.	As a biographical documentary, Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel is complete and satisfying. As a leading character, Mrs. Vreeland is entirely entertaining.	[An] entertaining bit of hagiography ...	It can be hard to keep up at points -- not with the plot, but with the amount of inspiration that Diana can still strew over an audience.	An affectionate portrait created with visual flair, Diana Vreeland is entertaining, informative, and stylish, due in large part to its charismatic subject.
Bateman is perfectly cast as the understated lead and Kunis works well as divisive eye candy, but it's the supporting actors who really shine.	Not the comedy of the year, but a decent movie with several chuckles in it. Mike Judge fans will probably want to seek it out, just don't expect an OFFICE SPACE.	Extract may be the most disappointing American comedy of the decade, partly because it's jokeless and joyless but mostly because it squanders an all-star cast of superb comic talent.	Mixing absurd comedy with understated dialog, Mike Judge spins an amiable farce about marriage and work ethics	It has all the ingredients for cult immortality and will likely live on long after this year's Oscar winners are forgotten.	Extract has some very funny moments and several fine performances, but the film feels slighter and more uneven than Mike Judge's previous work.
It's a bittersweet finale to one gigantic masterpiece, rich with character, ambience, and exhilarating action.	Not one of the 10 best films of the year, but it would be no surprise if it walks off with many major awards.	The word trilogy, which was handed such a black eye by the Matrix movies, is restored to its proper dignity with Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.	It leaves us with precisely the same feelings of sadness and satisfaction as are evoked by J.R.R. Tolkien's original novels.	Return is the equal of the magnificent opening episode, The Fellowship of the Ring.	Visually breathtaking and emotionally powerful, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is a moving and satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy.
Made with style.	With the exception of some minor glitches in the sound synchronization and a nighttime performance of The Band's 'The Weight' that is uncharacteristically grainy, the film looks and sounds great.	The film virtually proves that rock 'n' roll is here to stay.	Long-lost documentary footage of '70s stars emerges and makes an oft-revisited era fresh and exciting.	Although their on-board antics are mighty entertaining, it's the extraordinary performances -- including Joplin's historic, heart-rending 'Cry Baby' -- that lift this movie into the cannon of classic festival films.	Festival Express is a spellbinding documentary that nostalgically chronicles five days in the summer of 1970, when a train full of now- legendary rock perfomers jammed its way across Canada.
In an entertaining way, the movie says something challenging, that it's possible to lose your life to stuff -- and never even know it.	Borte's polished treatment of the material feels confidently in service of his point -- it's an assuredness that reminded me of David O. Russell -- and the actors involved commit to their situation wholeheartedly and entertainingly.	The execution just didn't live up to the clever premise. If we aren't going to get into the heads of these characters as they witness the havoc they wreak, then director should have kept up the satirical tone of the	Teen sex, drugs, drinking pop up in satire on materialism.	The premise of this social satire is so enjoyable you keep trying to believe it even though it makes no sense	It doesn't pursue its subversive premise as far as it should, but The Joneses benefits from its timely satire of consumer culture -- as well as a pair of strong performances from David Duchovny and Demi Moore.
"The Intern" has more of the sting of real life to it than writer-director Nancy Meyers normally allows. And while it's still packed in her usual gauze, the film isn't just likable and sweet, but also poignant.	A fun and warm-hearted first hour here is undermined by the film's preachy and unfocused second half.	This is one of those warm, unchallenging comedies that's entertaining to watch even though something about it feels vaguely inane.	This earnest, effusive haut-bourgeois fantasy, by the writer and director Nancy Meyers, runs roughshod over rational skepticism with the force of her life experience.	The dialogue flies past in strings of cliches and emotional beats that don't land, and the underlying message about love and work, work and love is so retrograde that it makes "Prada" seem empowering.	The Intern doesn't do enough with its timely premise, but benefits from the unorthodox chemistry of its talented leads.
The adult performers fare considerably better than the young lead in this faithful adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic.	With her sweet-sad face, Mara Wilson is a perfect Matilda.	Dark, beautiful adaptation of Roald Dahl story is uncompromising, entertaining and moving.	Slick kids movie that preserves Roald Dahl's gleeful nastiness.	Not awful and certainly not great, Matilda is a strange little flick, but that's not to say your 9-year-old daughter won't get a solid kick out of it.	Danny DeVito-directed version of Matilda is odd, charming, and while the movie diverges from Roald Dahl, it nonetheless captures the book's spirit.
Testament of Youth keeps its touch light; there's a kind of inevitability to Vera's circumstances that must have rankled her even as it made her path clear. And that path is grimly fascinating.	Cast in depth, edited with grace, the picture does great justice to a text that has, of late, become a little under-discussed.	This is no dusty history piece or judgmental look back at the past but a fresh, immediate, personal testimony that speaks across the ages.	The film has an extraordinary way of capturing emotional minutiae while still indulging a grandly cinematic understanding of human connection in its most instinctual form.	It's a great character sketch, but it's not character-driven. It's war-driven, and that may be its main point.	Testament of Youth is well-acted and beautifully filmed, adding up to an enriching if not adventurous experience for fans of British period dramas.
What we've been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book.	Fans of No Country For Old Men may find the film insufficiently quirky (do not expect humour, not even the darkest kind), the decimated world created is wholly compelling and a submersive experience.	Partly horror, partly sci-fi, mostly a family-bonding drama with stellar acting and patient action.	Is the film too grim? Or not grim enough? In a perverse way, I fear it's both.	Filmed as if dictated by Jehovah but ultimately boasting only a fraction of the artistic value of, say, Terminator: Salvation	The Road's commitment to Cormac McCarthy's dark vision may prove too unyielding for some, but the film benefits from hauntingly powerful performances from Viggo Mortensen and Kodi McPhee.
There's less sexiness in the awful Casanova than in the downbeat, doomed gay love story featuring Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.	Lasse Hallstrom's costume comedy Casanova is pretty flat. In fact, it's leaking air all over the place.	A shrivelled little romantic comedy.	Casanova is such a sheer delight that every fault gets swept away by the stubborn glee of it all.	Hallström's latest is fine but unambitious, content with what it is -- an arthouse trifle for the masses.	This frothy, oddly bloodless film does a disservice to the colorful life of the real Casanova.
Just a slam-bang succession of gross-out mutilations, played for giggles.	The frights, the archetypes, even the predictability of it all is predictable, leaving behind a dull, brainless novelty that makes more sense as a TV sweeps stunt.	New Line's smartest move was letting Ronny Yu direct.	I dare you not to have fun watching Freddy Vs. Jason. It's the most entertaining film of the summer, the best slasher in years, and one of the best pictures [of] 2003.	Dull blades. Saddles audiences with a buckets-of-blood mentality that deadens the spirit and drowns the film.	Fans of the two horror franchises will enjoy this showdown. But for everyone else, it's the same old slice and dice.
Birthday Girl won't make you forget Kidman's better work, but it's not a film you long to excise from your memory.	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and, by extension, its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual.	It's a fast-moving, original film for the first 45 minutes, and a deathly tedious one for the next 45. It balances out to be mediocre.	A deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish.	The movie isn't that funny when John and Nadia are pulling off their awkward courtship dance and it goes completely flat in its thriller aspirations.	Kidman shows her range in this quirky movie, but the shift in tone from romantic comedy to thriller may leave viewers unsatisfied.
Dinner for Schmucks has everything that money can buy. That does not include comic inspiration, daring or velocity.	Against all reason and expectation, the result is a distinctly unfunny film.	Dinner for Schmucks might start out as an exercise in laughing at idiots but it turns into something much more rewarding.	Everything clicks in front of and behind the camera, making Schmucks good summertime movie entertainment.	Some colorful detail and mildly amusing character work (particularly from Steve Carell and Jemaine Clement) gets largely lost in a movie that can't decide whether it wants to be sour or sweet.	It doesn't honor its source material -- or its immensely likable leads -- as well as it should, but Dinner for Schmucks offers fitfully nourishing comedy.
Planet Pandora's plant and animal life is done with a wonder that has been often absent from fiction screens.	...as lush and impressive as one might've expected.	A born again, freshly buffed wheelchair warrior turned unwitting capitalist tool in league with a digitalized free spirit princess, takes on forest foreclosure and the military industrial complex, in this breathtaking futuristic identity theft odyssey.	The best picture of 2009, one of the best films of the decade and, really, one of the best movies I've ever seen.	This movie takes itself way too seriously; there are no cute or funny moments, no rah, rah, nothing. I didn't love this movie or hate it. It''s one big blurry pile of meh.	It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.
Tony Scott is a deft hand with these Bruckheimer/Simpson productions and provides the perfect vision for their big budget fodder.	A gripping and tense thriller.	It's noisy and fun, but that's all it is.	I don't know what the full Naval procedure is to launch nuclear weapons, but I hope to God it's more structured and fail-safe than what we see in this film.	War Games in the water; older teens and up.	Boasting taut, high energy thrills and some cracking dialogue courtesy of an uncredited Quentin Tarantino, Crimson Tide finds director Tony Scott near the top of his action game.
This movie defines the words "comic romp."	Favorite line: "Why don't we just shoot 'em down and be through with it.	So many excellent actors and stunt men do so much in this film that it is beyond my space allowance to begin to credit them.	For every inspired set-piece, there are one or two that don't work, making this a frequently frustrating watch.	What can you say about a comedy where the Three Stooges are the most sedate people on screen?	It's long, frantic, and stuffed to the gills with comic actors and set pieces -- and that's exactly its charm.
Director Jonathan Demme's latest isn't so much enjoyed or savoured as appreciated, even admired, for its skill and daring.	Rachel Getting Married is a portrait of a family reeling with pain and resentment -- and rising to the challenge of dealing with it head-on.	As a recovering addict on the verge of imploding Hathaway is the stuff that Oscar dreams of.	In case you aren't sufficiently annoyed by the real weddings you can't wiggle out of, meet Rachel Buchman and her problem-child sister Kym.	If Rachel Getting Married were a real movie, it would be one of the worst of the year. Luckily, it's not a real movie, so Snow Angels, Mad Money and Fool's Gold need not worry about the competition.	Rachel Getting Married is an engrossing tale of family angst, highlighted by Anne Hathaway's powerful performance and director Jonathan Demme's return to form.
In the end, Memory of a Killer sticks, hauntingly, with you.	Decleir's performance alone would be reason enough to see it, but the clever script and nifty execution are added attractions.	pictures an evil sociopath in such a far-fetched, romantic, unrealistic manner that it's nothing more than a cartoon rather than the thriller to which it aspires	The film won't put you at the edge of your seat, but will keep your attention.	Played waaaay too long, but it was still fun to see an older guy kick so much butt.	Even though The Memory of a Killer is standard genre fare, it is also engaging and stylish.
Its plot is pretty much standard-issue. But the action is spectacular enough to allow the audience to overlook that problem.	Tony Jaa is the real thing.	The meat of the matter is fight sequences, and rather than being goosed with now-common digital effects and Hong Kong-style wirework, it's all real and all breathtaking.	Suddenly The Matrix looks about as relevant as VHS tapes.	The opening scene is best, of men combatively climbing a huge tree like crazed monkeys. After that, it's a steady slide down into the sludge pond of global junk cinema.	While Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior may be no great shakes as a movie, critics are hailing the emergence of a new star in Tony Jaa, whose athletic performance is drawing comparisons with Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li.
Thirteen Days is like TV writ large, but not large enough to freshly illuminate history.	[A]ll the more gripping for being written, directed and acted with such scrupulous restraint.	The story is so gripping and the ensemble performances so dominating that Donaldson really manages to disguise the fact that the movie is just a succession of conversations between middle-aged white men.	Efficient and low-key, Thirteen Days takes itself just seriously enough while maintaining a powerful dramatic momentum.	Perhaps the most human depiction of Jack and Bobby we've ever seen.	Thirteen Days offers a compelling look at the Cuban Missile Crisis, and its talented cast deftly portrays the real-life people who were involved.
still the second-best Muppet movie you'll find	...just as silly and uneven as its predecessor.	The usual pleasures are all here, but the puppeteers seemed especially intent on giving themselves logistical challenges this time around.	A brisk and consistently funny family entertainment. [new DVD review]	That first film with the muppet crew had to be a success; this time it was more difficult. Nonetheless, the caper plot that Henson and company worked out manages to hold adult interest for quite a while.	The Great Muppet Caper is overplotted and uneven, but the appealing presence of Kermit, Miss Piggy and the gang ensure that this heist flick is always breezily watchable.
While there's a certain tautness to the result, the many longueurs along the way almost make one yearn for an infusion of good old Hollywood pizzazz.	This is a film where we should be on the edge of our seat as we wait to see what will happen next. There are lives hanging in the balance, but from the way the situation is presented in the film, you'd hardly think that anything is wrong.	When the gut-wrenching conclusion of A Hijacking comes in the form of a single, random act, it's only then you realize how far you've been pulled into its emotional core.	It's a radical departure from any thriller in stateside theaters.	A lean, stressful nail-biter, smart, well-written, nicely shot and wonderfully performed.	A tense, gripping thriller, A Hijacking avoids action movie cliches and instead creates a palpable sense of dread by mixing gritty realism with atmospheric beauty.
Nigh-on perfect.	One of the most entertaining and exciting animated features ever made, one of those rare sequels that bests its predecessor.	A very good film, especially considering it is a sequel. Although not as innovative as the original (how could it be), Toy Story 2 still packs plenty of laughs and surprises.	A barrel full of fun that operates successfully at two levels. First, as a joyful and energetic film, it will captivate children of all ages. Second, with its clever script full of cinematic in-jokes, it will also appeal to more experienced filmgoers.	A fun, brilliant, and excellent film that parents will be able to enjoy just as much as their kids, if not more so. It's that good!	The rare sequel that arguably improves on its predecessor, Toy Story 2 uses inventive storytelling, gorgeous animation, and a talented cast to deliver another rich moviegoing experience for all ages.
While Just Go With It never descends into full-on unfunniness -- the absurd interjections of Nick Swardson as a German sheep trader named Dolph Lundgren see to that -- it seriously struggles to draw laughs consistently.	A very funny romantic comedy that nicely combines Adam Sandler's acerbic sweetness with Aniston's down-to-earth warmth - and that finds an excuse for Aniston to both play an average person and yet dress like a movie star.	Being open to total, unmitigated imbecility is your best chance of enjoying anything in this exceptionally puerile film.	Just go with it -- and take it out of here.	I inflicted this movie on myself and now someone's got to pay.	Just Go With It may be slightly better than some entries in the recently dire rom-com genre, but that's far from a recommendation.
A simple tale, told so well while being so revealing. There are many reasons why it shouldn't work, but because it does, it feels magical.	This minimalist, digital-video-shot film has its own cinematic flash and thunder, and does things only movies can do.	[Von Trier] portrays intense evil to make us wonder at the resilience and generosity of Grace, that 'alabaster' saint who exemplifies her name ... to a point.	Has the discipline to properly challenge us, to incite discussion on any number of topics, and to leave us with something to think about the next time we look in the mirror.	Don't waste your money on this one.	A challenging piece of experimental filmmaking.
A very welcome, if simple, departure from the typical Disney mold that's highly entertaining to boot.	An audience dominated by young children was disconcertingly quiet during a preview screening.	Often feels long, like a half-hour cartoon stretched to feature length.	An amusing but predictable knock-off of themes that have been done much better.	A zany tonic, more upbeat and funnier than the lugubrious Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas.	The Emperor's New Groove isn't the most ambitious animated film, but its brisk pace, fresh characters, and big laughs make for a great time for the whole family.
A bracing brew of a supernatural kid flick, stirring in all the dazzling magical ingredients optimum for casting a spell over audiences of all ages. While for a refreshing change, reading minds rather than mindlessly smashing them to bloody bits.	(F)ireballs and lightning bolts that wouldn't be out of place in an old Ghostbusters flick. There's even a bit of nostalgic charm in that. Then Turteltaub breaks out the dancing brooms and we remember Disney's misguided money grab that got us here.	No magic here.	Ever wonder what the Harry Potter films would be like without an ounce of wit, grace or subtlety? Wonder no more.	If you're a kid whose summer holidays are starting to drag, this should kill a couple of hours. Just do your folks a favour and don't make them come along.	It has a likable cast and loads of CGI spectacle, but for all but the least demanding viewers, The Sorcerer's Apprentice will be less than spellbinding.
Spike Lee's younger cousin writes and directs his first feature with the verve and panache of Lee's own debut, She's Gotta Have It.	Lee is a naturally funny writer, and his ensemble approach allows him to tap into an apparently bottomless reservoir of great-looking, ingratiating black actors.	Lee spins an engaging yarn of funny and true-to-life emotional complexities, but his characters resolve all their issues far to easily as the closing credits begin to loom.	Great film, great script, great premise and great characters.	Highly entertaining!	With a strong cast and a host of well-defined characters, The Best Man is an intelligent, funny romantic comedy that marks an impressive debut for writer/director Malcolm D. Lee.
Reasons remain to watch this movie: the development of Fergus and the fine performances, most notably Whitaker and Richardson, who plays her character with just the right number of screws loose.	Even if you know the big surprise, it's a compelling drama	Erratic but forcefully acted.	The Crying Game's effectiveness comes not from the big reveal, but from the expertly crafted story that frames it and makes it into a meaningful reversal rather than a sudden isolated shock.	An astonishingly good and daring film that richly develops several intertwined thematic lines, The Crying Game takes giant risks that are stunningly rewarded.	The Crying Game is famous for its shocking twist, but this thoughtful, haunting mystery grips the viewer from start to finish.
Up there with No Direction Home and The Filth and the Fury, Marley is one of the greatest ever historical music documentaries.	It's hard to imagine audiences who don't know much about the man sticking around for more than a few minutes of this. And they're the ones who need to know about him most of all.	Given the legal and logistical constraints on this long-delayed project, this lengthy movie is as comprehensive a history as Marley's fans could have hoped, but the uninitiated may not catch a fire.	The enormous popularity of the transcendent reggae superstar shows no signs of abating, a situation"Marley," a moving and authoritative new documentary, takes as its mission to illustrate and explain.	I'd have preferred more of the material presented during the final credits, a montage showing Marley's influence and fanbase in different parts of the globe.	Kevin Macdonald's exhaustive, evenhanded portrait of Bob Marley offers electrifying concert footage and fascinating insights into reggae's greatest star.
Not subtle and certainly not a film that protects anyone's sensibilities. For this, and for Catherine Breillat's understanding of the pain of youth, it's well worth watching.	I first saw Fat Girl upon its original US theatrical release in 2001. I left the theater exhilarated. Three years on, I feel I had been fooled.	Get over the numb shock that accompanies the end credits, give yourself some distance from it and you may actually appreciate the complex machinations behind Breillat's brave, troubled work.	Thin on plot but stuffed with subtext, providing some very French food-for-thought.	A viciously insightful examination of the ways in which the bond between two teenage sisters is tested when they begin to realize just how powerful and double-edged a weapon beauty is, and how cruel the consequences of its unequal distribution can be.	The controversial Fat Girl is an unflinchingly harsh but powerful look at female adolescence.
The best mix in his directorial career between typical Spielbergian flourishes of audience-friendly spectacle and seriousness of intent.	Empire of the Sun is not as graphic as the hellish worlds of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, but Spielberg doesn't sugarcoat the horrors of war.	One of Spielberg's best films, yet seldom shown.	Christian Bale, then 13, is a revelation as Jim, an obnoxious British colonial child being brought up in luxury in China.	Spielberg...displays a progressive and sophisticated awareness of issues of class and race that may be viewed as an apology for the casual imperialist and racist assumptions of his Indiana Jones series.	One of Steven Spielberg's most ambitious efforts of the 1980s, Empire of the Sun remains an underrated gem in the director's distinguished filmography.
Roskam directs The Drop to handsome effect, throwing a handful of dazzling compositions in among shots that get the job done.	A well-crafted swansong for the great Gandolfini in the same genre that propelled him to global attention and a reminder of how much he'll be missed.	The Drop is the last film Gandolfini made before his death. As send-offs go, it ain't too shabby.	The Drop stays impressively tight: a handful of lives in the balance and a 2am deadline make for an arresting conclusion.	The Drop represents the kind of standard I wish Hollywood would aim to hit more often. While not a revelation in any capacity, it's made with confidence and has enough emotion to justify a visit.	There's no shortage of similarly themed crime dramas, but The Drop rises above the pack with a smartly written script and strong cast.
Isn't going to win any awards, but it's a distinct step up from most striving-against-the-odds high school movies.	Dear Todd Graff: Thanks, man.	You have to respect any movie that name-checks the Velvet Underground and assumes its tweenage viewers will get the reference -- or ask their parents later.	An immensely enjoyable, if predictable, ride.	These are characters that make mistakes, they redeem themselves, and they grow throughout the course of the film.	Bandslam is an intelligent teen film that avoids teen film cliches, in an entertaining package of music and coming-of-age drama.
If you're a teen-age boy, you'll love Gone in 60 Seconds, because I think it must have been your peers who made the movie.	Check your brain at the door, enjoy with popcorn.	This is the kind of movie that ends up playing on the TV set over the bar in a better movie.	The audience for this is who?	Most of the film idles like a Chevy Nova that hasn't been tuned up since the Bush administration.	Even though Oscar-bearers Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Robert Duval came aboard for this project, the quality of Gone in 60 Seconds is disappointingly low. The plot line is nonsensical, and even the promised car-chase scenes are boring.
For adventurous filmgoers, though, this Spanish import offers something off the beaten path and a chance to play the coffee-shop game: Could This Screenplay Be Saved?	Well acted by a primarily young cast headed by Eduardo Noriega and possesses several particularly bold images that take good advantage of the qualities of the medium.	A jigsaw puzzle of passion and lust, desire and pain.	Confirmed my suspicion that Alejandro Amenábar may be the most promising filmmaker under 30.	The cumbersome, fantastical plot twists of its last 40 minutes render the whole thing unfathomable.	Director Alejandro Amenábar tackles some heady issues with finesse and clarity in Open Your Eyes, a gripping exploration of existentialism and the human spirit.
Jarringly entertaining!	Hard Boiled, directed by the master of the genre, director John Woo, is a cult favorite. The Corruptor isn't in that league.	A very enjoyable movie!	A half-hearted photograph of the real thing.	A memo to Chow Yun-Fat: Get back to Hong Kong on the double!	This uninspiring cop thriller doesn't measure up to Chow Yun-Fat's Hong Kong work.
It's a jarringly realistic hybrid that echoes the more surreal aspects of real, rural life, and Norton walks/ambles through it all, sporting dueling personalities and distinct accents, but one very serious heart.	Meant to blow your mind when not pulling your leg, the film has some surreal surprises in store. Like homicidal potheads, a Jewish menorah wielded as a deadly weapon, and a suspicious swastika scrawled backwards at a bible belt synagogue crime scene.	The movie bubbles with intellectual curiosity and narrative ambition. And for that I dig it, even if Leaves of Grass has the habit of swerving and sometimes lurching from tone to tone.	Messy genre jumbling has rhyme and reason in Leaves of Grass, as it speaks directly to the film's portrait of life's unpredictability and uncontrollability.	a fitfully enjoyable but unsatisfying playground of ambition and occasional wit	Edward Norton delivers one of his finest performances in Leaves of Grass, but he's overpowered by the movie's many jarring tonal shifts.
The title is perfectly apt -- and too easy a target -- for this romantic comedy that never shifts out of second gear.	A frolicsome comedy about a 35-year-old who loves living at home with his parents; good chemistry between McConaughey and Parker make the romance work.	A nice premise with poignant sociological foundation (adult children living with parents) gets a crude treatment in this romantic comedy, which suffers from repetitive structure and lack of stylishness considering its caliber of stars.	Failure to Launch is a not-so-distant cousin of those happy-go-lucky herpes commercials that play on television--it's so far out it scans as science fiction.	a cloying mess crying for another rewrite, or maybe just the quick mercy of being plunked into the nearest trash can	The few comic gags sprinkled throughout the movie fail to spice up this formulaic rom-com.
At times, you can even see fingerprints on the models, a touch that curiously makes them even more magical.	This film, my dears, is not a curse. It is a blessing.	Don't even try to figure out how Park can move plasticine figures around and achieve visual and slapstick miracles. Just enjoy.	Clay superstars Wallace and Gromit could teach most flesh-and-blood actors how film comedy works.	There's none of the Hollywood cynicism or too-clever winks meant to instill a sense of exclusive superiority, just a sincere celebration of what makes good filmmaking and a desire to entertain.	The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a subtly touching and wonderfully eccentric adventure featuring Wallace and Gromit.
[Even after] the plot's spiralling, shimmering sleights of hand and its never-ending ruses and deceptions . . . the ending will still pull the rug out from under [you].	If Nine Queens draws you on a journey that eventually leads up a garden path toward your own suckerhood, it's all the more pleasurable for having done so with such slick expertise.	A polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con.	As clever as a firkin full of simians and as stylish as they come, writer-director Fabian Bielensky has fashioned what may just be at the top of the list of con movies.	Bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent.	Deliciously twist-filled, Nine Queens is a clever and satisfying crime caper.
Coolidge knows he's making a slacker comedy, so he makes it as a slacker would: He doesn't try too hard for laughs, just enough to get by.	Attention, comedy shoppers: The marked-down movie Employee of the Month has more laughs than most of the name-brand products.	Dumb, crude and surprisingly mean-spirited.	The problem lies with the bland bombshell at the center and the overall sense that the filmmakers keep missing obvious comic opportunities.	Before Employee of the Month shoots itself in the foot with an immensely lame finale, the film does cash in with a few comedic bright spots.	Employee of the Month features mediocre performances, few laughs, and a lack of satiric bite.
It would be hard to imagine a less necessary Holocaust picture than A Secret.	A somber and haunting personal film told with the scope of The Godfather trilogy that's sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who sees it.	A blue-chip cast and handsome stagings do little to prevent this French movie being a muddled, pretentious washout. Substantial re-editing might have helped.	Avoiding histrionics and overstatement, Un Secret reveals a story about a family's past suffering that may not be unique, but in this telling is quietly powerful.	Suitably tense, sad, and deeply poignant.	A Secret is poignant, sad, and beautifully crafted, featuring fine performances that stave off a drift toward soap opera territory.
Lee's direction is wonderfully fluid and, as in most of his movies, he is superbly served by the striking cinematography of Ernest Dickerson and strong lead performances. However, there is a glibness to his script.	You'll remember Sciorra and Snipes but wish you had learned more about them -- and the society that complicates their lives so cruelly.	Lee tackles the subject of interracial romance from the unavoidable vantage point that, while things today are more open, they are also considerably more volatile and complex.	Instead of showing how prejudice seeps into the private intimacies of daily life, the film turns its attention to the other characters.	Jungle Fever is not to be underestimated or ignored.	Jungle Fever finds Spike Lee tackling timely sociopolitical themes in typically provocative style, even if the result is sometimes ambitious to a fault.
At what point does the filming of kids behaving immaturely become an invasion of privacy, even if parents signed consent forms?	Burstein may not know when to back off, but she's genuinely curious about all she sees. I bet audiences, particularly young audiences, will respond to this picture.	Riveting documentary is bound to get kids talking.	Burstein could be faulted for occasionally staging her 'plot points,' but she can't be accused of making anything but a riveting piece of film.	In contrast to other recent documentaries about coming of age in America, American Teen seems somewhat simplistic, perhaps naive.	American Teen skates some thin ice with its documentary ethics but, in the end, presents a charming and stylish (if packaged) tale.
It's exciting watching Bahrani explore the possibilities of neo-realism to dramatize penury and disenfranchisement among the service-class in this country.	All these low-level criminal enterprises and idle dreams aren't happening in Mexico City or Kandahar; they're just outside Queens.	Shot in the unvarnished sets of New York's Iron Triangle, the unpaved mud holes of the streets and the rough plywood of bedroom walls tell an unforgettable story of growing up in a world with little pity	Little Orphan Annie Latino-style, with an Oliver Twist!	Chop Shop is concerned principally with the kind of hard, marginal labor that more comfortable city dwellers rarely notice.	Filled with excellent performances, Ramin Bahrani's deft sophomore effort is a heartfelt, hopeful neorealist look at the people who live in the gritty underbelly of New York City.
Everything is handled with an anvil-like importance, forgetting that, in essence, this is tale of great joy and hope.	Surprisingly sedate telling of the rather well-known tale from Catherine Hardwicke.	A perfectly good cast is undone by a mish-mash of thick accents that are at moments impenetrable.	A motion picture depicting the birth of the Savior ought to stir the soul, not just pass time during a frantic holiday season.	For this viewer it felt a bit too much like a made-for-TV special.	The Nativity Story is a dull retelling of a well-worn tale with the look and feel of a high-school production.
A sly celebration of the sheer joy of moviemaking, filled with playful visual and aural tricks that tickle and delight.	A collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films.	Very well made, but doesn't generate a lot of tension.	After his mind-bending, exhilarating Fight Club, director David Fincher takes on a more conventional Hollywood thriller.	Apart from one plot twist too many, "Panic Room" is a seamless suspense-thriller with a top-notch cast.	Elevated by Fincher's directorial talent and Foster's performance, Panic Room is a well-crafted, above-average thriller.
[VIDEO] A surprisingly sweet and candid look at the problematic nature of young love, "Like Crazy" is a romantic showcase for Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones.	Although Like Crazy contains some emotionally on-target scenes, the movie as a whole feels glum and artificial.	Drake Doremus, a maker of agreeable miniatures, takes another step forward.	It's like being trapped in an improv workshop run by people who share too much on Facebook.	Doremus delivers a tightly focused film that's all the more impressive for being improvised.	It has the schmaltzy trappings of my romantic films, but Like Crazy allows its characters to express themselves beyond dialogue, crafting a true, intimate study.
Heaven help me, this Madea character is starting to grow on me.	Two movies for the price of one, but the comedy smashed against the drama makes the whole thing less entertaining	Tyler Perry continues to preach to the choir with his entertaining albeit stereotype-laced blend of melodrama and comedy.	Wouldn't be Perry if the film wasn't outrageously irrational, flimsily edited, acted with rafter-quaking severity, and scripted with Magic Markers. I'd feel cheated at this point if he actually made a concentrated effort to maintain a steady dramatic tone	If the movie is a mess, it's a purposeful mess, cannily, if not artfully, pushing all the right buttons to ensure Perry will be back for another round.	Divided between sincere melodrama and populist comedy, Madea Goes to Jail fails to provide enough laughs -- or screen time -- for its titular heroine.
A worthy attempt, but the sum of Pearl Earring is less than its individual parts would suggest it could -- and should -- have been.	visually striking but stultifying... there's less predatory hide-and-seek in 'Dracula' than there is here, and at least the vampires eventually put the bite on their victims.	A languorous, quietly mesmeric romantic drama of artistic (and other pressing) urges.	Dryer than a Tucson winter.	Girl With a Pearl Earring brilliantly captures the texture of ordinary life.	Visually arresting, but the story could be told with a bit more energy.
Much like I feel in the voting booth every four years, the political satire American Dreamz rendered me frustrated and confused.	The sort of satire so 'affectionate' that all of its would-be poison-tipped arrows seem to be coated in sugar.	I doubt that American Dreamz is much smarter than what it's satirizing. It hasn't earned the right to scorn.	In the words of Simon, it's a complete and utter disaster.	When spoofs of bad singing and songwriting are the sharpest arrows in your quiver, and your politics are diluted until they hit about as hard as someone sticking their tongue out, your satire has a problem.	This overly silly satire aims at too many targets with arrows too dull to make relevant social commentary.
Sorority Row isn't remotely scary, but it's still a lot more fun than it ought to be thanks to strong performances and a witty, terrifically bitchy script.	...a sporadically watchable yet thoroughly disappointing horror effort that's underwhelming even by the standards of the genre.	Simultaneously knowing and clueless, the script has the try-hard feel of someone attempting to update the savage teen talk of Heathers, while the plot unfurls as if Scream never happened.	Worse even that its insipid script (co-written by Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger) is Elliot Greenberg's editing of a meandering slasher pic notable only for the number of nubile bare breasts that it manages to fit into nearly every other scene.	Even the gratuitous nudity can't quite save a Heathers-goes-to-college horror that's undermined by a silly plot and clunky dialogue.	Though it's slick and stylish, Sorority Row offers nothing new to the slasher genre and misses the mark both in its attempts at humor and thrills.
Russian Ark doesn't act so much as it muses: on art, on history, on Russia versus the West, on politics.	The camera work is fluid, the concept intriguing.	Although it is an awesome technical feat, the movie turns out to be just a clever stunt whose welcome is worn out long before the ending credits roll.	Enlightening and stifling all at the same time.	A magnificent feast for the eyes and brain.	As successful as it is ambitious, Russian Ark condenses three centuries of Russian history into a single, uninterrupted, 87-minute take.
Elektra Luxx'' needs a star whose secret weapon is that she only looks and sounds as dumb as people think she is. It needs Melanie Griffith.	"Elektra Luxx" has a playful, breezy sexiness that gives the world of the film, porn biz and all, a refreshing innocence.	Writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez is all over the map with a bizarre multi-character drama that never really clicks.	sometimes clever, sometimes just odd	Everything about this movie is off.	A bizarre sex comedy full of meandering subplots, some occasional wit, and, unfortunately, not a whole lot of funny jokes.
This tired followup manages to recycle all that was obnoxious about the first movie while abandoning the one legitimately frightening element of the original: the tape.	Everyone really wants The Ring Two to be as frightening as the original. But unfortunately, the deadly videotape does not hold up to repeat viewings.	Samara, the evil ghost from The Ring, hasn't upgraded.	A tiny bit of the freakiness of the original is lost...but the pros outweigh the cons.	Only the tone-deaf will mistake The Ring Two for its eerie 2002 predecessor.	Ring Two serves up horror cliches, and not even Hideo Nakata, the director of the movies from which this one is based, can save the movie from a dull screenplay full of absurdities.
Villains rarely get the lead-character treatment in Hollywood, and that alone makes Chronicle worthy viewing if one is craving a unique found-footage film.	Chronicle isn't just a unique found-footage movie or superior superhero film, it's a truly enjoyable blend of the best each genre has to offer.	Only works as long as you're willing to overlook some of the obvious discrepancies in the use of its format and feel it's a story worth telling regardless.	Both a clever use of the found footage technique and a demonstration of its limitations.	Without the found-footage distraction, Chronicle is an entertaining and creative take on the concept of teenage superpowers.	Chronicle transcends its found-footage gimmick with a smart script, fast-paced direction, and engaging performances from the young cast.
What's the Worst that Could Happen? takes a while to get going, but once it does, it's surprisingly effective, just as long as you appreciate it for what it morphs into - a no-holds-barred wacky comedy.	Just about all of this potential is squandered by script and direction that look for easy sitcom laughs at every turn.	A dreary walk down comedy's Memory Lane.	I'd rather watch a forgotten houseplant dehydrate and die.	Mildly amusing, if unusually stuffy.	Talented cast is squandered by an uninvolving script filled with unfunny gags.
Damon is so dead-on scary that Hollywood likely shudders to be alone with him.	Like a filet mignon served rare, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is an exquisite sensory experience that's cold at the center.	Familiarity is the watchword of this overblown opus, which neglects holes in the plot to play up its postmodern theme of identity as pastiche -- a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black.	The film was neither dark enough to horrify, nor emotionally engaging enough to really touch us, and Matt Damon's acting left us both non-plussed.	It's an eerily affecting film that reminds us that everyone has wanted to be someone else at some point in their lives.	With Matt Damon's unsettling performance offering a darkly twisted counterpoint to Anthony Minghella's glossy direction, The Talented Mr. Ripley is a suspense thriller that lingers.
Rich in the kind of economic and social detail that explains how most samurai managed to live out their lives with only infrequent bursts of martial glory.	An intensely humane exploration of the heart of a reluctant warrior.	The story sometimes slips into soapy territory, but when you think the schmaltz is going to ruin it, Yamada gives it just enough of a twist to make you realize this is not your regular romantic film.	Tender, melancholy, suspenseful and, finally, uplifting.	Stylish flick, which harkens back to the work of old masters like Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu.	Samurai epic as a touching drama.
There's a likeable freshness about the entire production%u2026 I felt quite energised after watching this contagious, colourful and uplifting musical that merges fantasy and reality together with such zest that we suddenly feel the sky is the limit %u201	HSM3 is eminently watchable, occasionally very funny, and sweet enough to give you diabetes.	If you're under 12, you won't be disappointed. If you're over 12, the fact this is as funny and bright as it is insipid won't stop you from avoiding it like the plague.	No Disney movie has made me re-evaluate my life like this since D2: The Mighty Ducks. Perhaps HSM 3 is the perfect bookend to my teenage teamwork movie. At least this time I can look back and realize I have made the right choices.	Efron and co-star Vanessa Hudgens have charm. But director Kenny Ortega buries them in formula dances, forgettable tunes and dialogue that makes Grease sound like Greek tragedy.	It won't win many converts, but High School Musical 3 is bright, energetic, and well-crafted.
Elisha Cuthbert makes a huge big-screen splash worthy of Clara Bow or Brigitte Bardot -- almost.	The whole thing is cheerfully engaging, thanks to inspired direction by Luke Greenfield.	What seems to be another wishy-washy teen movie is actually a surprising little number that grabs the attention at the least expected moments.	The nudity and profanity may be the reason for the R rating, but [Timothy] Olyphant is what gives the movie a dangerous edge.	Young moviegoers who think Risky Business is old business should find the new model provocatively entertaining.	The movie borrows heavily from Risky Business, though Hirsch and Cuthbert are appealing leads.
The film, Wheatley's fourth, feels both reckless yet fully controlled, a jest that's dead serious in the manner of Yorick's skull, which gets a sort of cameo in the final act.	"A Field in England" will likely appeal to Ben Wheatley fans with its combination of drama, horror, thriller and comedy.	It forces you to work but with two and a half million unemployed that can't be a bad thing.	Some films are described as kaleidoscopic, but few have ever earned that adjective as literally as A Field In England.	Very physical, with intense performances and half-serious period talk, it's an impressive, haunting picture - though the sort of thing you have to meet at least halfway to enjoy.	Recklessly assembled and occasionally compelling in spite of itself, A Field in England showcases a singularly brilliant voice in British cinema.
By the end, when everyone should be rooting for Crystal and Ryan to get together, the whole enterprise has long since soured.	Reiner's film breaks the romantic-comedy mold because it's not so much about Harry and Sally as it is about men and women.	The fake-orgasm-in-a-deli set piece propelled Ryan into stratospheric stardom, but there are numerous other pleasures to be found in Nora Ephron's Oscar-nominated screenplay and Rob Reiner's astute direction.	What keeps the momentum going, despite the story's predictability, is the dialogue and the chemistry, which makes for a high-wire act.	...consistently funny, with writing of the 'In a city of 8 million people, I have to run into my ex-wife!' calibre.	Rob Reiner's touching, funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.
Smart and sweet, mature and bawdy, knowing its characters' flaws yet open to the possibilities of people acting upon their best instincts. It is without a doubt one of the year's best films, even as it lands in theaters amidst the late-summer doldrums.	Lily Tomlin earned an Oscar nomination for her first film role, in Robert Altman's "Nashville," 40 years ago. Her performance in "Grandma" should make her a strong candidate for a much-belated second.	A perfectly pleasant mix of humor and drama that will remind you how much Lily Tomlin is missed as a regular fixture in movies.	More gut-wrenching than belly-busting.	Tomlin's impressive performance can only elevate the movie beyond its predictable storyline so much.	Boasting a stellar performance from Lily Tomlin and some powerfully empathetic work from writer-director Paul Weitz, Grandma is a dramedy that shouldn't have to ask you to visit.
Frankenheimer easily ranks as the pre-eminent director of political intrigue.	Set the standard for cinematic paranoid thrillers and stands as the quintessential John Frankenheimer film. [Blu-ray]	This genuinely frightening and daring film blew holes in the political complacency of post-war American cinema.	Frankenheimer's TV shooting style is only adequate, but it's the McCarthyist and Freudian undertones that make Candidate a winner.	Mystery drama. Cold-War political farce. Spine-tingling thriller. Read it how you will...takes us for a wild ride through the mother of all conspiracy theories.	A classic blend of satire and political thriller that was uncomfortably prescient in its own time, The Manchurian Candidate remains distressingly relevant today.
[Singer is] reborn - deft, elegant, spring-heeled - in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The special effects don't bog him down: They lift the movie to a surreal and more emotional dimension.	X-Men: Days of Future Past succeeds at being a thrilling and fun superhero movie, balanced by well-earned dramatic weight.	It's more enjoyable than the other blockbuster action super-hero films that have been released so far this summer.	The action and effects are handled expertly and as with previous X-Men films and comics, there is speechifying, unlikely alliances, sudden betrayals and the dénouement will have fans of the original movies swooning.	It's maximalist Hollywood filmmaking at its best, the kind of extravagant production that, like a Wagner opera, can sweep you up in a sense of mythic grandeur even as you struggle to follow what's going on.	X-Men: Days of Future Past combines the best elements of the series to produce a satisfyingly fast-paced outing that ranks among the franchise's finest installments.
Remains an intriguing blend of the political and the personal, with Stone turning his memories and his opinions about Vietnam into potent drama. [Blu-ray]	The utter chaos of war in Vietnam is brilliantly portrayed. No one can deny this film the power of its images and the weight of all-pervasive terror it creates.	a pained portrait of men driven to the brink of existence for reasons that no one could ever quite explain	This film is an act of courage. Stone, the gutsy writer-director, records in a devastating barrage of images the relentless horror and the senseless carnage experienced by far too many Americans in Vietnam.	No sane person should want to get any closer to war than this film.	Informed by director Oliver Stone's personal experiences in Vietnam, Platoon forgoes easy sermonizing in favor of a harrowing, ground-level view of war, bolstered by no-holds-barred performances from Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe.
What begins as a sexually charged, energetic rock love story featuring two actresses pouring their souls into two iconic characters grinds to a halt beyond act one.	The film is remarkably devoid of preachiness. The material is handled with an admirable amount of ambiguity and is all the better for it.	A hugely enjoyable trash fest. The perfect way for Runaways virgins to pop their Cherry Bomb.	The Runaways is let down by its inability to decide where the story ends, but it will doubtless resonate with anyone who ever dreamed of quitting school to become a rock star.	Stewart and Fanning totally inhabit their roles to an almost frightening degree; Stewart just simply IS Joan Jett, from the petulant sneer to her raspy lyrics to even her slouched walk.	Viewers expecting an in-depth biopic will be disappointed, but The Runaways is as electric as the band's music, largely thanks to strong performances from Michael Shannon, Dakota Fanning, and Kristen Stewart.
It would take a much better director than Greg Berlanti to animate this corpse ...	In lieu of any real humour, we are subjected to a parade of tired spew-and-poo baby jokes and the age-old odd couple scenario, which Heigl and Duhamel admittedly handle nicely despite a flat script.	Life as We Know It turns into a reasonably honest consideration of what it might mean to have to honor the dead by raising their living, breathing, pooping, screaming progeny.	What you may not expect is quite how satisfying much of the film is, with Duhamel turning out to be a very good sparring partner for Heigl, whose lush, soft exterior conceals a very spiky interior that tends to wilt her co-stars.	Josh Duhamel props up Heigl and makes this wildly uneven comedy her best rom-com since "Knocked Up."	Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel make a charming couple with plenty of chemistry, but that isn't enough to make up for Life as We Know It's formulaic plot and poorly written script.
One of the best of the modern Disney animation efforts to date.	The world will fall in love with Hercules.	Chock-full of celeb cameos, puns and contemporary camp, the movie is annoyingly hip.	What fun!	On any level, earthly or otherwise, the ingenious new animated Hercules is pretty divine.	Fast-paced and packed with dozens of pop culture references, Hercules might not measure up with the true classics of the Disney pantheon, but it's still plenty of fun.
Disturbing, heartening, and with a cautionary vibe and a compassionate heart, this is a film designed to fuel debate and to provide the blessed release of a good laugh when things hit too close to home	The Duplasses' sensitivity, which is genuine, yields too much tepid relationship-speak, and Marisa Tomei, one of the most appealing actresses in Hollywood, is left with little to play.	Cyrus" also often plays like a Judd Apatow comedy stripped to the bone. Although the Duplass brothers are credited as the screenwriters, most scenes feel as if they were largely improvised with Reilly and Hill especially forced to use their wits, which th	Cyrus is strong enough to free them from their tiny corner of deep-indie cinema. But today's films have so little interest in exploring character that it's worth lamenting when one of the last champions of character specificity undershoots the target.	"Third-act failure" hobbles what could have been a rewarding black, or at least dark, comedy...	While it may strike some viewers as slight, Cyrus is a successful hybrid of mainstream production values and the mumblecore ideals of directors Jay and Mark Duplass.
Ice Age 3 is wittier than Kung-Fu Panda, certainly as slick as Toy Story. The Ice Age franchise shows no signs of thawing out. Come on 4!	With derring-do and a bold spirit, Ice Age 3 rockets along nicely, even if character concessions are made.	I can't figure out how a character as great [as Scrat] keeps ending up in movies like this.	Not bad, not good.	Nice, sweet, safe.	Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs boasts some excellent animation -- in particular, the dinosaurs are wonderfully realized -- but its story is tired and monotonous.
There is pathos in funerals, family issues, and loneliness but it helps the audience connect with the characters and makes them more real - they manage to find laughter even in the darkest of situations.	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand, Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production.	A Danish Nora Ephron movie in Dogma drag, and the result is even more precious than it is tedious.	Sweetly sexy, funny and touching.	A charming study of language as the way to another's heart.	Unlike many romantic comedies, the charming Italian for Beginners feels natural and genuinely heart-warming.
In contrast to its great title, Mad Hot Ballroom is anything but: Let's just say I was not spellbound.	Yet another example of a slight, TV-newsworthy story that jitterbugs its sweet little self into exhaustion on the big screen.	Sure to sweep you off your feet.	It is a bit like watching a home movie. Still, the kids are very cute, and I did get caught up in the drama of the competition, such as it was.	Charming if slightly overlong.	This heartwarming documentary will win audiences over, as the sheer charm of precocious, enthusiastic children learning to dance resonates from the screen.
A fresh, funny feature film debut with heart, winning performances and promise.	The whole movie is diagrammed. It's a just-add-water trifle.	The whole affair is fun and light, to be sure; so fun and light it almost floats away.	I loved Jump Tomorrow ... for a heart that beats with wisdom and warmth and nary a trace of contrivance or sticky manipulation.	[Hopkins'] inspired sense of humor is equaled only by his inspired casting.	The light-hearted romantic comedy Jump Tomorrow charms with its whimsy and sweetness.
I liked The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but I wanted to love it.	While director Fincher has accomplished any number of technical marvels in the film, Benjamin Button lacks a soul.	Every decade gets its Forrest Gump. David Fincher's version of a little known (and monumentally depressing) F. Scott Fitzgerald story is this one's. That's either a damning condemnation or just what the doctor ordered.	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button puts a Hollywood sheen on a decidedly eccentric yarn.	Despite its length and expansive pace, it's never dull. And, despite the dubiousness of its stabs at being "meaningful," it still leaves you with more than most mega-productions.	Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an epic fantasy tale with rich storytelling backed by fantastic performances.
Hesher is funny and off-kilter without being cloying, and Gordon-Levitt gives an appealingly unpredictable performance.	Fascinating in its shaggy, offbeat way.	Moviegoers will have to admit the movie is true to itself.	Hesher himself [is] a mysterious, magnetic, repellent, and alluring figure... It's quite an astonishing performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.	Hesher is a risky gambit that's pleasingly provocative.	It has a dark sense of humor and a refreshing lack of sentimentality, but like its title character, Hesher isn't really interested in going anywhere.
Scorsese may be flailing here, but Scorsese flailing is more formidable than most directors at the top of their form.	After coming out gangbusters in its first and finest hour, the 180-minute movie loses all its chips in the remaining two.	[A] Vegas masterpiece.	Visually impressive, splendidly performed, thematically significant, this is a movie in full possession of every key cinematic asset except one -- a solid script.	Fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the mob's control of LasVegas in the 1970s.	Impressive ambition and bravura performances from an outstanding cast help Casino pay off in spite of a familiar narrative that may strike some viewers as a safe bet for director Martin Scorsese.
What Herzog gleans from Yaskyuov's exhaustive material is a simple observation: The men of the Taiga are heroes of rugged individualism.	"Happy People" seems to strain toward the notion that harsh nature makes for a pure heart. And perhaps it does for some. But all?	Quirky and a little scary and rapturous all at the same time.	From Siberia, with Happiness	It would be inaccurate to call Happy People: A Year in the Taiga the newest Werner Herzog film.	Filled with breathtaking images of the foreboding Siberian countryside, Happy People: A Year in the Taiga is a fascinating look at an isolated society.
A truly amazing performance by Javier Bardem.	Spain's Javier Bardem gives an undeniably dynamic lead performance that lifts this labor of love over its incessant downer premise.	Achieves a kind of visual poetry, rhapsodic and turbulent.	Arenas is not presented as a cliche, as the heroic gay artist crushed by totalitarian straightness, but as a man who might have been approximately as unhappy no matter where he was born.	Sencillamente, una de las mejores y más emotivas cintas del ańo	An impressionistic, fragmented look at Reinaldo Arenas, Before Night Falls' imagery manages to evoke a sense of the writer's artistry, and Bardem's strong performance holds the film together. Finally, a biopic done well.
The enigmatic Andreotti is the perfect subject for a biopic in the European tradition.	After I saw Il Divo, I suppose I should have felt indignation. I suppose I should also have felt that way after "The Godfather." But such films present such mesmerizing figures that I simply regard them, astonished.	You may not leave the theater with a firmer grasp of Italian politics, but you will leave with an appreciation of some outstanding filmmaking.	Director Paolo Sorrentino's knockout drama Il Divo concentrates on Andreotti's final government (1991-92) and subsequent legal battles.	This is a spectacular film about corruption in high places, specifically as that relates to the political life of Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy and a senator for life.	While the web of corruption in this Italian political thriller can be hard for a non-native to follow, the visuals and the intrigue are compelling and thrilling in equal measure.
The comedy-drama succeeds as a sharply pointed portrait of sibling rivalry.	A dramatic comedy not quite like any other, and one that sets new standards for Mr. Allen as well as for all American movie makers.	Allen weaves together the complex narrative strands with ease, punctuating the many variations on betrayal and love with three festive Thanksgiving dinners.	The usual fever of adjectives -- terrific, titanic, transcendent -- sounds puny.	The tangled web of relationships is very effectively done, but just as affecting is Allen's portrayal of the city he loves.	Smart, tender, and funny in equal measure, Hannah and Her Sisters is one of Woody Allen's finest films.
A genuinely fun confection of old-fashioned entertainment.	The Muppets are always great. Heartbreaking plot with a joyous end.	Not as good as the original Muppet Movie, but close.	Runs a close second to The Muppet Movie for pure Jim Henson magic.	Simply an overblown East Coast copy of the original Muppet Movie.	If it's not quite as sharp as The Muppet Movie, The Muppets Take Manhattan is still a smart, delightfully old-fashioned tale that follows the formula established by the first two movies -- a madcap adventure assisted by a huge group of human stars.
This is a tremendously life-affirming film that will be remembered as one of the year's best.	When it comes to sports movies, there's nothing like the real thing, and there's never been anything quite as real as the documentary Murderball.	A... push-and-pull conflict -- between wild, raging passion and playing nice so as not to upset the neighbors -- characterizes [the film]...	Its honesty makes Murderball compelling and rewarding. What makes it so downright entertaining is its subjects' charisma and strength - both spiritual and physical.	In less than an hour and a half, the athletes profiled in the documentary will frustrate you, amaze you, make you laugh and make you cry -- but you'll never feel sorry for them.	An entertaining and gripping documentary that shows being confined to a wheelchair doesn't mean the fun has to end.
Only because it's so awful, it's good.	It is hopelessly inept and incompetent, but has a place in the canon, albeit a lowly one. It lets us know how badly things can go wrong, and how passion is not always enough.	Like the greatest cinema poets, [Wood] always managed to work in his own particular pet pleasures or concerns, and that odd, ear-bending dialogue is almost like a bizarre kind of open-verse poetry.	Not nearly as awful as everyone seems to think it is.	Hardly The Remains of the Day, but some would claim it's more fun.	The epitome of so-bad-it's-good cinema, Plan 9 From Outer Space is an unintentionally hilarious sci-fi "thriller" from anti-genius Ed Wood that is justly celebrated for its staggering ineptitude.
Director Alan J. Pakula, who cowrote the script with Frank Pierson, has done a reasonable job of compressing Turow's plot into a two-hour space. But the narrative skeleton is all that's left.	I think I liked it much more the first time that I saw it a few years ago, and maybe because I didn't know how it was gonna end at the time. Knowing what I did this time around, the film was still quite engaging for the most part.	A top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story.	An engrossing adult drama that relies on complex characterizations and twisty plotting, and doesn't ask us to accept its central character as a superman.	So good you'll wonder why John Grisham gets all the cinematic adaptations and not Scott Turow.	Thanks to an outstanding script, focused direction by Alan Pakula, and a riveting performance from Harrison Ford, Presumed Innocent is the kind of effective courtroom thriller most others aspire to be.
Gory torture bloodbath checks in for another stay.	It's beautifully put-together and it builds to a satisfying climax in which Roth implies that if men are capable of great violence and women are capable of great violence, then that would include just about all of us sitting in the audience, too.	Just a sub-par and obscenely overrated piece of lazy horror filmmaking...	This isn't exactly a movie review.But "Hostel: Part II" isn't exactly a movie. It is pornography %u2013 shockingly violent, grotesque pornography.	Roth might have chutzpah, but, sadly he doesn't have any interest in actually scaring us. The moviemaking is driven only by contempt; he wants to nauseate us into submission.	Offering up more of the familiar sadism and gore, Hostel: Part II will surely thrill horror fans.
Human nature trumps all in [this] thoughtful, engrossing tale of intrigue and instinct in 1980s East Germany.	Catnip to audiences who never heard of The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum.	Twisting perspectives on lives, actions and consequences, this magnificent film satisfies on every level	Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's film is a melodrama in a minor key, quietly affecting, quietly chilling, quietly quiet. It captures the drab architecture of totalitarianism, the soul-dead buildings of a soul-dead state.	Builds tension and develops its characters slowly, and it is surprisingly engrossing.	Unlike more traditional spy films, The Lives of Others doesn't sacrifice character for cloak and dagger chases, and the performances (notably that by the late Ulrich Muhe) stay with you.
[Hilary Swank] has come out of nowhere to deliver one of the year's finest pieces of acting.	Peirce seems to have researched her subject with grad-school-thesis intensity.	The movie seems hyped on its value as a statement of -- what?	Driven by performances of such luminous humanity that they break your heart.	Fine acting and a sincere, realistic approach to the its morbid subject matter, but somehow the pieces do not coalesce into an engaging film.	Hilary Swank's acclaimed performance pays fitting tribute to the tragic life of Brandon Teena.
Lohan dazzles us once more. ... The smartly written script is a perfect match for her intelligent brand of comedy.	Fey's script balances acid humor and a sweet understanding that the viciousness of high school is good preparation for life.	The movie is always entertaining and frequently smart about the new ground one girl will break to humiliate another.	A very original, funny and highly accurate dissection of the teen girl world.	It's not a classic, but it's an above-average and refreshingly smart teen comedy.	Funnier and more smartly written than the average teen comedy.
A loud, claustrophobic movie packed with artificial colours and characters whose weapons are rockets of debilitating spew they summon at will from their throats.	Warner Bros. has added insipid narration to explain the subverbal action taking place on the screen. But no, there isn't enough of that to prevent your kids from becoming drooling zombies.	This predictable, uninspired third installment to the endless saga won't win over non-believers.	A 75-minute sensory assault.	If not exactly enjoyable, then at least halfway tolerable.	Critics say that the third Pokemon movie has a better plot than its two predecessors. This is not enough, however, to recommend it to those not already fans of the franchise.
If it doesn't hit the great heights of a Pixar film, it's a lighter and zippier concoction than a lot of non-Pixar entities.	The 3D effects are deployed most effectively in a sequence at a theme park, Vector's 'squid gun' and the climactic showdown, but I'm not sure they justify the premium price.	The film is funny, energetic, teeth-gnashingly venomous and animated with an eye to exploiting the 3-D process with such sure-fire techniques as a visit to an amusement park.	Gru is a bit bland as a baddie.	Despicable Me is the sort of movie about which it is the most difficult to write. It is not a bad film. On the other hand, it didn't set my heart racing either. It is a sort of lukewarm winner, neither terrific nor terrible.	Borrowing heavily (and intelligently) from Pixar and Looney Tunes, Despicable Me is a surprisingly thoughtful, family-friendly treat with a few surprises of its own.
This is perhaps the most enchanting and zealous animated endeavor you will see this side of the Pixar lineup.	A picture that relies on a potpourri of cubist and impressionistic sensibilities to tell a standard coming-of-age story in a way it's not been told before.	The film's final image is a poetic paean to the Book's living power—a power that The Secret of Kells, like Aisling, recognizes without, perhaps, fully understanding.	Unlike anything else you've seen, and very much worth seeking out, this is a unique and beautiful creation.	Kells has a decidedly pleasing-to-the-eye, retro-cartoon vibe ( ... ) an intriguing and rare artistic subgenre	Beautifully drawn and refreshingly calm, The Secret of Kells hearkens back to animation's golden age with an enchanting tale inspired by Irish mythology.
A masterpiece of the German silent cinema and easily the most effective version of Dracula on record.	This classic horror film is like a fine wine that only gets better with age...	Freaky, lovely and very frightening.	Like the message, the acting will strike contemporary audiences as near hysterical, yet the actors' expressionism is a perfect fit for the expressionism of the filmmaker.	A landmark motion picture.	One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel -- and a chilling performance from Max Shrek as the vampire -- set the template for the horror films that followed.
The Patriot Act should be invoked to keep this trite feature from public consumption.	Annapolis is less like a movie than a virus -- one that clings so tenaciously to its host genre that it begins to take on the characteristics of a real movie, even though it's just faking.	From the obviously fake shipyard to the repeated violations of what most of us recognize as the 'Code' of the Academy, to the absurd casting of people who couldn't physically hack the Academy's physical requirements, Annapolis fails.	While Officer is an almost-great movie, Annapolis, watered down and one degree further from inspiration, is merely an almost-good movie.	The only impressive thing about it is the monotony and thoroughness with which it replicates cliches from older, better movies and hammers them into pop alloy to an up-with-me beat beat beat of its musical score.	Stocked with leading men who look the part but lacking an iota of original plot, Annapolis is merely a watery shadow of superior seafaring military dramas.
[Beauchamp's film] has an earnest solemnity that is appropriate to the material.	There is a patchy quality to the film that leaves us roiling with more questions than it is prepared to answer.	Beauchamp reaches this point without exploitation or cheap foreshadowing; there are no dramatic music stings underlying the outwardly innocuous biography before it methodically descends into true American tragedy.	Whatever power Keith Beauchamp's film possesses as a work of art has been superseded by its political impact...	This well-focused, short (75 minute) film will be an eye opener for those who didn't live through the era. For those who did, it will be all too familiar.	Without sensationalism or flinching from the brutality of the crime, this documentary is an eye-opening call for justice.
Shira Geffen's script is a poignant intersection of the regrettable past and the transitions that must occur to move on. In this 60th-year celebration of Israel, this film feels like the whole country.	Explores modern-day loneliness and alienation in Tel Aviv.	The fact that you care about each and every one of these people is testament to the filmmakers' understanding and abiding humanity.	There are sharply observed moments of social intercourse and a nice current of realistic honesty. But when I ask myself what it is that these women in the movie want, I come up with bubkes.	What gives the film a haunting and sometimes droll poetic unity is the way co-directors Etgar Keret and Shira Geffen trace all their characters moving in a jellyfish-like fashion.	Lyrical, well-crafted and inventive, Jellyfish smartly mixes comedy, drama and magic realism.
Some grisly and scary parts. Not for young 'uns.	This is vintage Cold War-era sci-fi, and one of the best films in the genre.	The acting was wooden, the romance was blah, and the religious messages tacked on were pathetic.	Too bad about the wooden cast, the tackily conventional romance, and a draggy religious message; but at least, given the time it was made, it isn't imbued with Cold War hysteria.	Understandably well-remembered, but its status as a high classic seems more incidental than earned.	Though it's dated in spots, The War of the Worlds retains an unnerving power, updating H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi tale to the Cold War era and featuring some of the best special effects of any 1950s film.
The most politically astute studio release since Bulworth.	War story, heist thriller, action comedy, human interest drama, media satire, and stylistic groundbreaker, Three Kings has no hope of filling all the roles it tries to occupy. However, it fills plenty enough to be a good movie, and then some.	It's gutsy stuff, disturbing but funny and strangely captivating.	It's gutsy stuff, disturbing but funny and strangely captivating.	An action movie with a conscience.	Three Kings successfully blends elements of action, drama, and comedy into a thoughtful, exciting movie on the Gulf War.
High Fidelity is like listening to a decent, though not exceptional, old LP: if you're willing to put up with all the pops, scratches and skips along the way, it's reasonably enjoyable.	Created a doggedly faithful adaptation of Nick Hornby's cult-fave novel.	Cusack works especially well with the unknowns in the cast, while Frears creates an ensemble that complements Cusack's more flamboyant moments.	Cusack shines in this honest and funny tale.	High Fidelity's hip structure and offbeat characters provide consistent laughs and a good time.	The deft hand of director Stephen Frears and strong performances by the ensemble cast combine to tell an entertaining story with a rock-solid soundtrack.
The Two Towers is riveting entertainment - few films could cover such distance (in both narrative and geographical senses) with such assurance - but it remains hard to explain with great certainty the details of the plot.	While I was expecting yet another derivative battle sequence, the siege on Helm's Deep is one of the most detailed and well crafted combat scenes ever put to film.	Brilliant and ambitious...does not falter in its mission to visualize Tolkien's ingenious work.	In one of the most fantastical settings and one of the most fantastical stories this year, Jackson has given us one of the most emotionally genuine films of this year.	Fans of the first movie will not be disappointed; neophytes may find the endless mixing it up with digital hordes a bit wearisome, even if the combatants are horrific hyena-riding orcs.	The Two Towers balances spectacular action with emotional storytelling, leaving audiences both wholly satisfied and eager for the final chapter.
Bulworth is a good idea for a movie, but it runs short of ideas, and gas, long before the end of the film.	A shrewd political observer for decades, Beatty has fashioned a hilarious morality tale that delivers a surprisingly potent, angry message beneath the laughs.	Besides its intriguing political agenda, Bulworth is packed with good performances.	If the film's plot had been based on Shakespearean literature, the movie still would have been displeasing...	Jaw-droppingly abysmal. Seldom has a major star embarrassed himself so badly.	Star and director Beatty's ambitious take on race and politics in 20th-century America isn't perfect, but manages to provide more than its share of thought-provoking laughs.
Since its release more than 15 years ago, The Princess Bride has often been copied, but never equaled.	One of Reiner's most entertaining films, effective as a swashbuckling epic, romantic fable, and satire of these genres.	Action and laughs blend deliciously in this fairy-tale spoof about true lovers who must defeat all sorts of villains to reach true happiness.	When it comes to pleasing both kids and adults, you can't do much better than The Princess Bride.	Children can see it as a bright, frothy adventure while adults will appreciate the subtlety and the sheer wit.	A delightfully postmodern fairy tale, The Princess Bride is a deft, intelligent mix of swashbuckling, romance, and comedy that takes an age-old damsel-in-distress story and makes it fresh.
A good natured comedy of hormonally charged, down in the mud slapstick.	While it's true that Colleen gets her backside slapped, that her face is licked by Rob Schneider and that he urinates under her chair as a way of marking his territory, it's no worse than what he does to the audience.	This movie is a rabid beast that should be put to sleep.	Should you consider getting near it, understand that it doesn't smell so good.	Lacking Sandler's barely hidden arrogance, Schneider is appealing in the lead.	While less offensive and more charming than recent gross-humored comedies, The Animal is still rather mediocre.
This is compellingly stupid and frequently hilarious, though you may want to bring a sick-bag, just in case.	Este é apenas mais um (longo) episódio do programa da MTV. A única diferença é que, desta vez, a Paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas.	The movie is designed to play for one audience and one audience only: existing Jackass fans.	More idiotic and dangerous than the show. Really.	All told, either you get it or you don't.	There's a good chance you'll be laughing hysterically at one stunt, but getting grossed out by the next one in this big screen version of the controversial MTV show.
Octogenarian pianist Seymour Bernstein is the charming, inspirational subject of this appreciative, occasionally fawning documentary directed by the actor/novelist/filmmaker Ethan Hawke.	The director thinks we would enjoy meeting Bernstein ... Hawke is correct.	More than a musical offering, it's a study in boundless passion, plus a wellspring of wisdom about art and life from a man who sees no dividing line between the one and the other.	Ethan Hawke's concentration on Seymour Bernstein isn't a betrayal of his own ego massaging, but rather an attempt to have a genuine soul-bearing conversation.	A positive, enjoyable and inspiring artist portrait.	Seymour Bernstein's genuineness shines so brightly in Seymour: An Introduction that viewers will forgive debuting director Ethan Hawke's reverent treatment.
Chow's best movie... one of the best knee-jerk laugh-out-loud crack-ups I've seen in a long time.	It's the sort of movie that leaves you smiling like an idiot.	Imagine, if you will, a soccer team comprising of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Sonny Chiba and Jet Li. Now imagine their games were broadcast by The Wachowski Brothers. If you wouldn't pay $8 to watch that team play, there's no helping you.	Kung Fu and sports movies collide in writer/director/actor Stephen Chow's devilishly entertaining Honk Kong action movie.	One of the silliest, sweetest and most fun family films in recent memory.	The plot is utterly ridiculous, and the soccer in the movie is unlike any ever played anywhere on Earth, but watching Shaolin Soccer, you will probably find it impossible to care.
If anything, the movie is a fable about accepting others as you would want to be accepted yourself. Unfortunately, the studios and general public didn't see it that way.	...the movie was never meant to be a horror film; it was meant to be a character study and morality play.	... Browning made the normal people the grotesque ones, showing how ugly they were because of their intolerance.	Browning's film really works to get the audience to view things from the freaks' perspective	The movie's influences can be found in nearly every conceivable corner of modern film.	Time has been kind to this horror legend: Freaks manages to frighten, shock, and even touch viewers in ways that contemporary viewers missed.
There may be very little that is nice about the people in this ferocious family film from Lumet but it's awfully nice to see him pull it off this late in the game.	Lumet's "Network" earned an incredible five acting nominations come Oscar time (three wins) and I wouldn't be surprised to see "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" earn a solid four.	Lumet tackles this material like an old master, finding scenes to settle into and hanging out there longer than a younger director might.	...nothing more than a perfunctory thriller...	This ambitious and well-directed crime thriller, with an intricate flashback structure redolent of Reservoir Dogs, gives Philip Seymour Hoffman a fascinatingly ambiguous character to work with.	A tense and effective thriller, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead marks a triumphant return to form for director Sidney Lumet.
One of John Carpenter's best films.	Jeff Bridges as appealing alien; best for teens.	Bridges' portrayal of Starman can be as hard to take as the lapses in logic.	Starman is more of a love story than a sci-fi movie. Take your girlfriend.	Sweet, smart and wonderfully acted.	What initially begins as sci-fi transforms into a surprisingly sweet, offbeat drama, courtesy of John Carpenter's careful direction.
Whereas Do the Right Thing left audiences stimulated, at the end of Bamboozled we feel exhausted and confused.	Bamboozled may not be the year's best movie, but it's undoubtedly the most important.	At his best, Spike Lee is too brave to be subtle.	Lee, in his least commercial film, shoots for controversy but loses focus.	A preachy and pretentious social satire ... that's quite embarrassing and never funny.	Bamboozled is too heavy-handed in its satire and comes across as more messy and overwrought than biting.
Howard and Morgan are able to structure a series of largely mundane events for maximum suspense.	Frost/Nixon is unsatisfying even if, like me, you're a lifelong aficionado of Nixon-bashing.	A totally mesmerizing battle of the wills between the occasionally charming yet wily Nixon and the increasingly desperate Frost.	Devoid of heroes, Frost/Nixon is a film about filming. And - perhaps because I ducked the play and loathed The Queen - I enjoyed every minute of it.	Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell and Matthew Macfadyen make the most of supporting roles, and it's impossible not to get caught up in the the momentum of events, which evoke a more principled time before news-media saturation.	Frost/Nixon is weighty and eloquent; a cross between a boxing match and a ballet with Oscar worthy performances.
Ethnic clichés abound, college comes off as a free sleepaway camp, and the simple wonders of unaccompanied singing are inflated to Las Vegas-style bombast.	All things considered, a lesser "Pitch Perfect" film is ultimately still brighter, funnier and more clever than most of today's studio comedies.	If Pitch Perfect 2 offers a lighter plot and less romance this time around, that's OK.	As before, an ingratiating cast, some catchy musical arrangements and a raft of killer quips make for an irresistible combination.	Hey, at least nobody is sliding around freshly spewed vomit in this one. Small miracles, people.	Pitch Perfect 2 sings in sweet comedic harmony, even if it doesn't hit quite as many high notes as its predecessor.
The film lays bare the roots of Patton's lust for power in his willingess to sacrifice everything to his vaunting ego, a trait which is mirrored in George C Scott's superb performance.	An absorbing, polished character study powered by an epic performance.	One of the greatest character portrayals ever put on screen, George C. Scott shows "Patton" as a gruff, tough, but caring and vulnerable military hero.	It's Scott's virtuoso performance that carries the film.	It's both fascinating and appalling the sort of extravagant technically superior spectacle that only a big Hollywood movie company could afford to make, and the story of a man about whom only the Establishment could become genuinely sentimental.	George C. Scott's sympathetic, unflinching portrayal of the titular general in this sprawling epic is as definitive as any performance in the history of American biopics.
Offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love, loyalty and the nature of staying friends.	If much of Me Without You strikes a familiar chord, it also intelligently captures the difficulties that can disrupt even a close friendship.	Goldbacher ... is most adept at visual storytelling, capturing intimate moments with breathtaking acuity.	Dark and painfully truthful.	The screenplay fails to generate any real sympathy for Holly or Marina once they have passed adolescence.	At times ponderous, Me Without You is engaging due to the fine work by Williams and Friel.
There's some pretty freaky diplomacy going on here.	My problem is that even though the three weird stories are intriguing and of interest in their own right, but when compiled as one film they seemed undeveloped.	Unlike Asian horror omnibus Three Extremes, the directors of Tokyo ! have little in common and the Tokyo cityscape isn't enough to make them bond.	There has yet to be an anthology film made where all of the shorts are of equal quality and that's certainly the case with Tokyo!.	The oddness is sort of refreshing.	An imaginative, if uneven, love letter to a city that signals a great creative enterprise by its three contributing directors.
Sublime, edible film with exquisite art direction.	A must see, Delicatessen is an absolute delight and a bizarrely madcap experience.	As fascinating as it is weird. And it's rrrrreally weird.	A zany little film that's a startling and clever debut for co-helmers Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro.	An amazing film, filled with amazing style, a wonderful off-beat tone, and some bits of satire which work with the film instead of being apart from it.	Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet deftly combines horror, sci-fi, and humor in Delicatessen, a morbid comedy set in a visually ravishing futuristic dystopia.
It takes every trick in the book of undersea filmmaking to try to make Sphere interesting to the mainstream.	You can't accuse the makers of Sphere of skimping on talent. If only they knew what to do with it.	Cool premise and eerie buildup from the first hour, ultimately downshifts into an unsatisfying film that drags long past its bedtime, and turns into a gobbledygook of psychological head games and illusions.	For a movie of a novel written by Michael Crichton with such a capable cast, Sphere is quite a disappointment.	Decent performances and an abundance of good ideas and effects but there is definitely a lack of pace to the dramatic tension and you may find yourself just not caring.	Sphere features an A-level cast working with B-grade material, with a story seen previously in superior science-fiction films.
Unpeels itself slowly and delicately, but finds moments of overwhelming feeling and sadness. It is restrained movie-making that packs real power.	Luckily, the movie has Scott Thomas. She knows her radiance can't be helped, so she uses it here like a searchlight.	A heartbreaking portrayal of the difference between disagreement and distrust.	Focuses on the strengths and shortcomings of the two women characters, several generations apart, and captures an uncommonly powerful portrait of both.	Sarah's Key is directed with some sensitivity but seldom catches fire, and Scott Thomas is left adrift in a part that doesn't quite match her abilities.	Sarah's Key is an absorbing, impeccably-acted Holocaust drama with minor plot issues.
A beautiful, almost defiant film on an unusual subject: love among the elderly.	It's high time for a reminder - love and lust are NOT sole ownership of the young.	Not only romantic, it's also touching, and its ideas are expressed with genuine eloquence.	This movie is so wise about love it makes us wonder what other love stories think they are about.	Turns into highbrow kitsch.	Not only does it break ground in presenting a rarely examined age group, Innocence is a well-acted, powerful story about love.
Doesn't even have the wit to be energetic, funny or humane en route to being inane, irritating, and corrosive.	We've got stereotypes-a-go-go: Raging redneck truckers. Accented Asians. Country bumpkins. Black fathers missing in action. The humor's a tad too raunchy for the kids, and the predictable plot won't win over any of the parents.	We all saw the trailers and commercials, so we should have known better than to have high expectations.	If I hadn't spent the majority of the film's running time coming up with alternate titles (Is This Thing Over Yet?), I'd almost think that Cube had made a fruitful step.	Parents should be warned that dropping the kids off at this one may be tantamount to child abuse.	This supposed family comedy staring the usually blameless Ice Cube and Nia Long has provoked most critics to write, "Is it over yet?"
Hardly a scene goes by that isn't visually striking or kinetically thrilling, and all of it enhanced by 3-D.	A stir-fry of visual and verbal treats to please every palate.	If there is one pleasant surprise in the movie, it's Lord Shen.	For a movie touting "inner peace," this 3-D sequel sure goes in for its share of battle scenes, but for the most part they are excitingly conceived by director Jennifer Yuh Nelson and her writers, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger.	Like that kung pao chicken at the back of your fridge, none of it's quite as crisp the second time around.	The storyline arc may seem a tad familiar to fans of the original, but Kung Fu Panda 2 offers enough action, comedy, and visual sparkle to compensate.
Take a bickering couple, put them in a car, get the driver drunk, add some terrible traffic and an escaped killer, and you've got "Red Lights," a movie I recommend to no one.	A compelling addition to the long tradition of artful French film adaptations of works of mystery and suspense literature.	Thriller/mystery buffs might find the narrative slow; the thriller elements aren't introduced until the movie is nearly half over, and the mystery starts even later. But a dandy payoff will reward those who are patient.	A suspensful road movie that wholly transcends the vulgarity of typically American attempts at the genre.	A devastating dissection of middle-age male disaffection.	Red Lights is a taut, character-driven thriller, set against the debris-strewn battleground of a failing marriage.
Still one of the best Disney animated films ever made...	The humor quotient is high, thanks to such scene-stealers as the duplicitous parrot Iago, the mischievous monkey Abu and, of course, Robin Williams' motormouth Genie.	Aladdin manages to be spectacular without seeming gratuitous or pretentious.	One of Disney's very best animated films.	Filme irreverente e com bons trabalhos vocais de Williams e Gottfried, embora pouco ambicioso dos pontos de vista narrativo e técnico.	A highly entertaining entry in Disney's renaissance era," Aladdin is beautifully drawn, with near-classic songs and a cast of scene-stealing characters.
Brooks' championing of good old-fashioned family values feels hopelessly nave and frankly unconvincing.	Sandler brings a humanity and sweetness to his role that makes one forget the brashness of Happy Gilmore and Mr. Deeds.	It's another movie about a dysfunctional family, but this one is different because they're original, lovable, forgivable and fascinating.	The conflicts here are TV-familiar, as are the flat visuals...	A mixed bag as a comedy, with some genuine moments of emotional power but far too many awkward and irritating scenes.	Paz Vega shines, and Adam Sandler gives a performance of thoughtfulness and depth, but Spanglish is ultimately undermined by sitcommy plotting and unearned uplift.
One of my all time favorite films.	The press kit says Gump brings a rare clarity to what we went through in the '50s, '60s and '70s. But I only saw a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers.	Credit for the success of the film has to start with director Robert Zemeckis, who has taken his Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit success and parlayed it into a more mature, yet equally entertaining, film.	A picaresque story of a simpleton's charmed odyssey through 30 years of tumultuous American history, Forrest Gump is whimsy with a strong cultural spine.	Forrest Gump has the elements of an emotionally gripping story. Yet it feels less like a romance than like a coffee-table book celebrating the magic of special effects.	Forrest Gump may be an overly sentimental film with a somewhat problematic message, but its sweetness and charm are usually enough to approximate true depth and grace.
Gourmet Brie on a baguette -- empty calories, and certainly a guilty pleasure, but what a delicious diversion.	Utterly preposterous but so full of enthusiasm and flashy style that it's entertaining anyway.	Brotherhood is set in 18th century France, and it kicks more butt than The Patriot	Check your brains at the popcorn stand, ignore most of the florid, subtitled dialogue -- and sit back and enjoy this genre-bending wild ride.	With this grisly popcorn movie, we're reminded of the heavy-handed contributions that some U.S. blockbusters are making to global culture.	Brotherhood of the Wolf mixes its genres with little logic, but the end result is wildly entertaining.
Turns a humdrum backwater into a black hole of crime and punishment.	The Square is a solidly constructed thriller with some missing pieces at the center but vivid splashes of color outside the lines.	The script is neatly plotted, though not without flaws. Some developments occur in a rush, as if to distract us from asking inconvenient questions.	The Square suggests an exciting future for a pair of brothers with a dark view of pitiless fate.	Superlative Australian neo-noir has everything you'd ever need for a delightfully dismal tale of deceit and murder.	The Square may not quite live up to the modern noir classics that inspired it, but with twists and tension to spare, it comes admirably close.
La narración de Van Sant, por más contemplativa o "inactiva" que parezca, nunca aburre o distrae al espectador.	The most fluid of films, it glides through its 81 minutes with a mesmerizing ease, skating on smooth tracking shots down the corridors of an American high school and into the heart of an American malaise.	Elephant never forgets that its shooters, Alex and Eric, also look like other kids. It doesn't demonize them, but instead, watches, alternately patient and tense.	Elephant hurts you in ways you don't see coming; its combination of the orchestrated and the raw gets past your defenses.	Van Sant's least 'show-offy', most personal, best picture in years (maybe ever), and an honourable attempt at respectfully considering the unbearable.	The movie's spare and unconventional style will divide viewers.
It's very funny and offers an amusing take-down of the pretentiousness of the art world and the way that it can be corrupted and co-opted by big money.	The widespread speculation that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a hoax only adds to its fascination.	Just as a permanent record of a remarkable artistic movement, Exit Through The Gift Shop is valuable. But there's more going on here.	It's endlessly arguable and open for debate. At the very least, we can all agree that Banksy has found a new wall on which to plaster his art -- that of the silver screen.	When it comes to what Exit is selling, buyers beware.	An amusing, engrossing look at underground art, Exit Through the Gift Shop entertains as it deflates the myths and hype surrounding its subjects.
Ralph Fiennes's Coriolanus is a bloody, testosterone-filled updating of Shakespeare's play, shot and performed with real vigour. This is the Bard done action-movie style.	A superb cast highlights this modern interpretation of one of Shakespeare's lesser known plays.	The play has been significantly but artfully trimmed by John Logan's screenplay, which preserves Shakespeare's language.	Fiennes makes a powerful case for Coriolanus as an essential, contemporary drama, about democracy, class war and the nation state.	As directing debuts go, Coriolanus could easily pass for the work of an accomplished master, and though the storytelling lends itself to easy confusion (owing more to the source material than to the execution), the emotional impact reads loud and clear.	Visceral and visually striking, Ralph Fiennes' Coriolanus proves Shakespeare can still be both electrifying and relevant in a modern context.
It plays like a Western, and the violence, while plentiful and visceral, rarely has the kind of raw impact you want in a movie such as this. Morelli keeps most of the blood off-camera.	An efficient, simply told story...in spite of the plot's neat contrivances and the movie's determination to pull some edifying nugget from the heartbreak and hopelessness at its core.	Perhaps it's unfair to consider Morelli's film against Meirelles': You might as well compare a company newsletter to Candide.	Fans of the series will be happy to know what's become of Acerola and Laranjinha, and newcomers may very well flock to the next Sundance Channel airing to catch up.	May mean well, but its soapy plot and comparatively flabby execution make for a surprisingly tepid combination.	Brutal and unflinching, City of Men is both a harrowing look at Brazil's favela life, and a touching tale of youths rushed into adulthood.
even if Superbad's not much more than a teen comedy, it's the best teen comedy to come out in at least a decade. There's no shame in that.	The thing that saves Superbad from being a profane waste of time is its urbane intelligence and above all, bracing honesty.	Super bawdy, super profane -- and super funny.	What makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone-addled pups and what's going on in their heads, where they're still clinging desperately to the innocence they're leaving behind.	A marvelous late-summer surprise, a film that's small in scope but big on laughs and--believe it or not, dick mouths--heart.	Deftly balancing vulgarity and sincerity while placing its protagonists in excessive situations, Superbad is an authentic take on friendship and the overarching awkwardness of the high school experience.
First-time director John Glen knows what's needed to create suspense...put the series' trademark wit, women, and song alongside the high-stakes adventure of a more brutal 007. [Blu-ray]	For Your Eyes Only keeps the James Bond tradition in good form.	too down to earth	One of the most thoroughly enjoyable of the 12 Bond pix [to date] despite fact that many of the usual ingredients in the successful 007 formula are missing.	Formula, fun Roger Moore Bond.	For Your Eyes Only trades in some of the outlandish Bond staples for a more sober outing, and the result is a satisfying adventure, albeit without some of the bombastic thrills fans may be looking for.
Based in truth, but with the simplicity and force of a well-crafted fable, Rabbit-Proof Fence is an elegant film that shows us the blind spots of history in a way that is moving without being didactic.	The film feels like the absolute truth, rare for historical cinema.	All of Rabbit-Proof Fence's characters are so well-drawn, so human -- that even in the harsh light of history -- it remains difficult to understand how Australia allowed such inhumanity to become institutional, mechanized and accepted.	A rare and complete triumph.	I think this topic might've been interesting as a documentary, but the film failed to engage me on any level.	Visually beautiful and well-acted, Rabbit-Proof Fence tells a compelling true-life story.
Frozen's narrative logic could be tighter. Some of its dialogue and lyrical content is out of step with some of the film's mature direction. But none of this is enough to cancel out what's rewarding about the story.	The biggest assets to any classic Disney musical are the songs, and the tunes in "Frozen" just happen to be the weakest link, making this attempt to return to the glory days of "The Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin," an arduous, frigid journey.	Frozen is a fine addition to Disney's animated pantheon, offering a witty and heartfelt princess fairly tale with creative musical elements and visual panache.	Despite the frosty title, it's a warm-hearted, rousing and stunning animated saga ideally poised for the holiday season.	Frozen may not rank as a great Walt Disney animated classic, but it still packs breathtaking scenes, welcome moments of visual and verbal hilarity, plus the most endearing cinematic tribute to sisterhood since A League of Their Own.	Beautifully animated, smartly written, and stocked with singalong songs, Frozen adds another worthy entry to the Disney canon.
Raucous, violent, in-your-face and occasionally advancing like a punch to the belly.	At its core Any Given Sunday is just another trite, win - one - for - the - Gipper paean to the gridiron.	I'm selling my shares in Dell and socking it all into Tylenol as soon as possible.	dead in the water	Any Given Sunday is director Oliver Stone's epic look at the world of professional football, and there is not one cliché, archetype or silly sports movie moment that he forgets to include.	Sometimes entertaining, but overall Any Given Sunday is a disappointment coming from Oliver Stone.
Takes the formula from the original 2001 hit and simply lathers, rinses and repeats.	While the first "Legally Blonde" quite impressed me as a fun and funny solid film, "Red White & Blonde" doesn't fill the high-heeled shoes.	This is Witherspoon's movie and hers alone.	The good news is that Reese Witherspoon is back as smart 'n' savvy Elle Woods. The bad news is that too much is recycled and derivative, rehashing the dumb blonde humor. But never underestimate the box-office appeal of a woman with a French manicure, awes	[Witherspoon's] so charming.	This blonde joke is less funny the second time around.
The whole South American adventure looks so forced you half expect Schwarzenegger to break into a travel programme piece to camera.	A stinker.	There's nothing here that you haven't seen before or has been pulled off better in some of the actor's earlier and far superior work.	The result is an 'action film' mired in stasis.	I've always liked his movies for a good laugh, and lately they've come up short on that score.	Despite its timely subject matter, Collateral Damage is an unexceptional and formulaic action thriller.
Makes you wish the makers - and especially the funders - of today's overblown big budget thrillers could be made to learn from some of the finer thrillers of the 1970s.	A careful work of adjustment and prophecy	...an efficient exercise in Watergate-era paranoia.	Taught spy yarn for its time; Redford as always watchable.	Redford, Dunaway, Von Sydow, Cliff Robertson and John Houseman turn in superb work, and the film is as pure a thriller as one could hope for, with a gripping premise, hurtling plot and a marvelous air of menace.	This post-Watergate thriller captures the paranoid tenor of the times, thanks to Syndey Pollack's taut direction and excellent performances from Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway.
Amidst all its clumsiness, the film does hit an uplifting note in its final segment, making the point that equality is a matter of human rights, not sexuality.	A warm-hearted, feel-good comedy that embraces its 1980s setting and highlights a small piece of forgotten history.	Without the well-honed, and not overly maudlin script, "Pride" would not have become the testament to support, commitment and love that it is.	It rightly and joyously gets to celebrate things that are rarely found in films set in modern-day Britain, such as political idealism and activism, community spirit, political bookshops, and sympathetic trade-unionists.	The miners saw their livelihoods destroyed. Wouldn't it be lovely if they wound up getting the last laugh?	Earnest without being didactic and uplifting without stooping to sentimentality, Pride is a joyous crowd-pleaser that genuinely works.
For better or worse, this is a revenge saga that refuses to take sides.	Despite some hints at conscience and humanity, Dead Man's Shoes is a typical slasher film at the core.	The ending feels like a desperate attempt to inject some emotion into the film. And it just doesn't work.	Though Meadows makes a lot of it, he mucks it up before it's over.	What makes it intriguing and eminently watchable is Considine's deft almost low-key portrayal of what is essentially an avenging angel.	Though enhanced by cramped, gritty camerawork, this unsettling look at violence and revenge lacks the provocative edge needed to give it a substantial kick.
A guilty pleasure -- but only if you like your action outlandish, your continuity challenged and your guts and gore splattered all over the screen.	If you can't improve upon your original in some small way, then you're simply churning out assembly-line product for a gradually more disinterested fan-base.	For my taste, it was better off left dead, roadkill on the cinematic highway.	Tense, brooding, scary -- there are plenty of words to describe 1986's superior B-movie The Hitcher. None, however, apply to this remake.	[It's] cheerfully in touch with its own brainlessness.	Sean Bean tries giving motive and emotion to the hitcher, but director Dave Meyers is more interested in cheap shocks, and gratuitious gore and torture.
Caton-Jones has an extraordinary find in Leonardo DiCaprio, the 17-year-old newcomer who plays Toby with just the right mixture of ingenuous sweetness and simmering anger.	Outstanding performances from DeNiro and Di Caprio in a tough, lyrical drama	It's a rites-of-passage drama with the kind of period small-town setting that the director is making his own.	DiCaprio goes toe-to-toe with De Niro, though his spectacular efforts here continue to be overshadowed by his Oscar-baiting in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.	It is an affecting teen melodrama haunted by twisted treehouse memories.	A harrowing, moving drama about a young boy, his single mother, and his abusive stepfather, This Boy's Life benefits from its terrific cast, and features a breakout performance from a young Leonardo DiCaprio.
Soupy, tedious mess.	Save for a few asides about 'moral trespassing' and a cliche or two about 'opening Pandora's Box,' the script isn't interested in that thorny debate.	...the film often resembles one of those cheesy straight-to-video thrillers which usually feature Eric Roberts and Kelly Rutherford.	So not scary that it's positively frightening--and not in a good sense...Just stamp it as you would a piece of unwanted mail: Return to sender.	Uma versăo ruim e 'científica' (com enormes aspas) do superior Cemitério Maldito - o que já é o bastante para que vocę tenha uma idéia da dimensăo do desastre.	A murky thriller with few chills, Godsend is features ludicrous dialogue, by-the-numbers plotting, and an excess of cheap shocks.
While there's little to hate, there's almost nothing to like in a film this anodyne. The jokes aren't funny, the performances are middling and the storyline predictable.	The makers of Post Grad managed to squander a promising and timely concept -- relative scarcity in the job market -- by turning in a screaming dud of a comedy.	Note to the writer Kelly Fremon: Is Ryden postgraduation or postmortem?	Post Grad isn't funny, surprising, or insightful enough to provoke more than a ho-hum reaction.	Without Alexis Bledel, this pic would be a TV sitcom. With her, merely passable.	A lightweight, unambitious comedy, Post Grad features fine actors that can do little with its middling, uninspiring script.
[An] utterly vapid distillation of a "true story," crammed into the tired old Full Monty formula.	A prefabricated crowd-pleaser with a distinctly by-the-numbers feel, distinguished only by Ejiofor's canny transvestite turn.	The brilliant Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things, Serenity) is fabulous as the outrageous Lola.	It may be very Prince Charming, but it's a story that's definitively old.	Though screenwriters Tim Firth and Geoffe Dean worked from fact, director Julian Jarrold makes everything feel much more contrived than fiction.	Kinky Boots relies heavily on the Full Monty formula of Britcoms, while playing it too safe in a desperate attempt not to offend. Ejiofor's performance is its redeeming virtue.
An audience on the edge of its seat doesn't quibble about plot points.	While parts one and two built momentum to an exhausting, exhilarating climax, part three has too many peaks and valleys (and, it seems, more of the latter than the former).	While it is funny and full of spectacular action sequences, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is clearly the runt of this trilogy's litter.	Forsakes much of the occasionally clever, somewhat wry dialogue and situations of its predecessors in favor of a more generic action-adventure approach.	Action bits soar, Sam Jackson scores ... the rest is a bore.	Die Hard 3: With a Vengeance gets off to a fast start and benefits from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's barbed interplay, but clatters to a bombastic finish in a vain effort to cover for an overall lack of fresh ideas.
Exhilarating entertainment that sacrifices not a scrap of intelligence.	There are no surprises about who dies, but the ingenuity of the good cops and the director's perfect timing combine to produce the best scene in the movie.	How good is "L.A. Confidential"? Kim Basinger gives a convincing performance - that's how good.	Curtis Hanson's resplendently wicked L.A. Confidential is a tough, gorgeous, vastly entertaining throwback to the Hollywood that did things right.	This may be the best movie of the year; it's definitely one of the greatest crime films of all time.	Taut pacing, brilliantly dense writing and Oscar-worthy acting combine to produce a smart, popcorn-friendly thrill ride.
Much better than the first in the series. In fact, it was better as action and better as social commentary. If like me you go with few expectations, you will be delighted.	Unfortunately, with so many internal commitments to the franchise, this isn't a Captain America movie as much as a slice of Marvel pie in which Steve appears.	That rarest of movie beasts - a sequel as good as the original.	This entry won't win any new converts, but anyone already invested in this series is going to have a blast.	In "Winter Soldier," amidst the chaos, our hero learns to be wary of the modern world. Welcome to the 21st century, Cap.	Suspenseful and politically astute, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a superior entry in the Avengers canon and is sure to thrill Marvel diehards.
Staunton ... is an actress of tremendous compassion and grace, an utterly irreproachable anchor to a difficult movie.	Boo, hiss and all that -- but I can report that the film left me only vaguely depressed and nothing more.	At their best, Leigh's pictures are confrontational without being invasive.	An affecting portrait of a kindly woman with no political or religious agenda, just a desire to be helpful.	The austerity of the film's latter part might seem merely maudlin had Leigh not so carefully established that life goes on in and around the film's central polemic.	With a piercingly powerful performance by Imelda Staunton, Vera Drake brings teeming humanity to the controversial subject of abortion.
Smart, stylized teen whodunit with violence and drugs.	The teens in Rian Johnson's striking debut feature Brick express themselves in jargon that sounds as if lifted straight from the pages of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.	I can't really recommend it to anyone, unless it's one of those lazy video nights and you're in the mood to experiment.	It has insolent wit, a taut style and strong characterizations. But it lacks the special quality needed to make a movie spring to life, a divine spark of real imagination.	Suburban kitsch gets played fast and loose.	This entertaining homage to noirs past has been slickly and compellingly updated to a contemporary high school setting.
The un-Tarzan!	Despite a nifty final twist and a willingness to dispense with a few taboos, it fails to establish a consistent rhythm.	Viva Riva! is exploitation cinema done right - it's got both feet planted in the here and now but its heart's bursting with the same lurid, filthy values that B-movies have embraced for decades.	What Munga has to say in this feature directorial debut is delivered via a quick-paced, gritty crime story that is both entertaining and enlightening.	Antoine Roch's digital photography is one of the film's strong points-it takes you right into the action from the opening scene...	Vibrant and violent, Viva Riva is a stylish, fast-paced crime drama.
David Mamet's play about the wheelings and dealings of real-estate salesmen gets dedicated playing from a splendid cast, but gains nothing by the transfer from stage to screen.	As an expression of a great script, it really can't be beat.	All of the actors are great, clearly enjoying the opportunity to sink their teeth into some meaty lines.	As fierce as it is funny. Rarely does does a film sustain such a fever pitch of dramatic intensity. One of the very best of 1992.	This brilliant, gutsy film features a nervy script by David Mamet and career-topping performances by Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin.	This adaptation of David Mamet's play is every bit as compelling and witty as its source material, thanks in large part to a clever script and a bevy of powerhouse actors.
Director/writer Nimrod Antal has made an extremely accomplished feature debut. With production designer Balazs Hujber, he has created a bizarrely original underground world of shadows and garish light.	You won't forget it soon, though it may give you at least some qualms about using the subway, especially if you're ever in Budapest.	Like Pen-ek Ratanaruang's Last Life in the Universe, Kontroll is another "chill out" production that's alternately lovely and sinister.	Plenty here to enjoy if you're a fan of trips outside of the norm.	Kontroll is the first work by a director who is clearly gifted and who has found a way to make a full-bore action movie on a limited budget.	Kontroll is a smart thriller that's dark, gritty, and funny.
Makes you pause and consider, not the fragility of justice and human rights in extreme circumstances, but the fusty and enfeebled condition to which Robert Redford's filmmaking has sunk.	It's another movie with an amazing cast, but McAvoy has the righteous indignation that makes The Conspirator hook you.	Historians and lovers of fascinating storytelling about little-known historical events will be captivated by the powerful and true story about America then and now.	Drama offers a fresh twist on an infamous episode in American history	The original story...is rich in historical detail but lacks depth of characters.	The Conspirator is well cast and tells a worthy story, but many viewers will lack the patience for Redford's deliberate, stagebound approach.
Leos Carax's long overdue return to feature filmmaking - behind such dark delights as "The Lovers on the Bridge" (1991) and "Pola X" (1999) - is a self-reflexive avant-garde examination of external and internal influences.	Mystifying and emotion-stirring, it demands that you bring yourself	Never before has being so confused felt so enjoyable.	From its enigmatic opening scenes, which sends the viewers into a mysterious voyage a la Alice through the looking glass that ends up in a movie theater, Holy Motors is a celebration of the magic, imagination, and primal power of the movies.	Audiences who care about character and plot are liable to take the exit to a movie that makes sense.	Mesmerizingly strange and willfully perverse, Holy Motors offers an unforgettable visual feast alongside a spellbinding -- albeit unapologetically challenging -- narrative.
The fighting is... wow. In a market saturated with Matrix-cribbed technique, Jet Li's 25 years of skills have a grace and power all their own.	Too often it seems to be just another action fantasy that teaches pacifism while indulging in brutality.	No matter how you slice it, Fearless is Li in his prime.	Jet Li is a formidable talent and has plenty of charisma, but it's the rest of the cast (or most of them) whose performances are stilted...no shortage of martial arts action in a variety of extended contest scenes	It takes time for the film to bounce back to the heights of its opening scene, but about midway it does.	Fearless is a brilliantly choreographed, beautifully filmed endcap to Li's quarter decade of epic martial arts glory.
It's laboured and obvious, and not even a Yuletide movie: Christmas is little more than a device to bring the family back under one roof. Still, its plot is as overstuffed as any turkey.	It's formulaic and corny as hell, but a top-notch cast keep this festive family drama believable - just.	Don't expect realism from this frothy little number, but do expect a bit of heart-warming cheer courtesy of romantic unions, overcome prejudices, reconciled enemies and general peace and understanding.	o matter how silly the situation, each member of the uniformly strong cast creates a nice balance between sentimental and sweet -- which is just how every holiday gathering should feel.	Goodwill be stuffed - this is about as appetising as a plateful of reheated sprouts.	This Christmas features strong performances and a sharp portrayal of family dynamics, but relies too heavily on holiday movie clichés.
Hardly an objective documentary, but it's great cinematic polemic...love Moore or loathe him, you've got to admire...the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions.	The film is very funny.	As the national media become more sedate and incurious, this country desperately needs a gadfly like Moore. Indeed, we need more like him.	For anyone who cares about the future of America, it's required viewing.	Here lies the charm of Michael Moore's style, he uses guerilla style journalism to ask the questions no one seems to be asking, of the people no one seems to have the balls to ask.	Though it may not always convince, Bowling for Columbine asks important questions and provokes thought.
YFAN is graphic without showing anything, incredible yet credible, engaging and morbidly fascinating.	All the performances are excellent, especially Patric, Stiller (in a particularly weaselly turn) and Brenneman as the film's most sympathetic character.	LaBute is very good at kicking over rocks, and even better at examining what crawls out from under them.	You will not like Your Friends and Neighbors; it's intense, unflinching and uncomfortable. You won't look away from it, though, and you won't forget the people it showed you for a long time.	It's both a daring composition and a repelling look at gender warfare.	Though it may strike some viewers as cold and unpleasant, Neil LaBute's Your Friends & Neighbors is an incisive critique of sexual politics wrapped up in a scathing black comedy.
2 Days in Paris is a mix of awful Woody Allen and mental masturbation.	It often feels a touch aimless, wandering about without much of a plot to rely upon. But in the end, 2 Days in Paris manages to be a pleasant enough diversion.	This is a rom-com with an authentically bitter aftertaste. It's also very funny.	A shoddy, sour handheld-video excursion	For all the verbal jokery, it's more tragedy than farce.	Delpy proves not only to be an adept actress, but makes her mark as a writer and director in this thought-provoking comedy that breaks the romantic comedy mold.
This unusual film dares to explore both the pleasures and the limitations of sexuality.	It's a brave art film only because of its porno sex scenes, but it is not necessarily a perceptive one.	Shallow though it might sound, it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast, perceptive camerawork, and imaginative ways of treating the love scene.	Its unflinching attitude toward sex is only weakened by the lack of enjoyment that the characters seem to have while actually having sex.	It's clearly a censorship landmark, but little else.	Acted out with both physical and psychological nakedness by its two leads, Intimacy is an unflinchingly honest look at alienation.
Doesn't really have a story, and for long stretches feels phoney	As happily glib and vicious as its characters.	Even though the story's a bit scattered, Gangster energetically evokes the hip '60s with groovy split-screen effects and a swinging soundtrack.	It's more than a rip-off of Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but less than the Pulp Fiction-esque genre-bender it aspires to be.	Clever, brutal and strangely soulful movie.	Gangster No. 1 is brutally violent, yet also compelling.
Blend fails to revitalize either genre	Over on the aliens side, it's hard to make out faces, but there's no doubt about their place of origin: These slimy, growling, bug-eyed and distinctly non-scary things are straight from central casting.	How the West was Lost in Space.	Enjoyable, but less fun than such low-stakes predecessors as 'The Phantom Empire' with Gene Autry and 'Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter.'	I don't care if you write Pirates and Dinosaurs or Unicorns vs. Robots, you can't go on lunch after coming up with the title.	Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are as dependably appealing as ever, but they're let down by director Jon Favreau's inability to smooth Cowboys & Aliens' jarring tonal shifts.
Pure hipster catnip.	A perceptive and tireless look at a minority culture within a minority culture, Tangerine should appeal to audiences far outside the LGBT community.	...has humor, tawdriness and a strange, persistent beauty.	What tips the scales in justifying the movie's screwball-comedy approach is the sheer human vitality of the people on screen, especially Rodriguez and Taylor.	"Tangerine" generously offers something unusual in a summer when relentless conformity could really use a dab of lipstick, a pinch of estrogen and an attitude that says I dare to be different.	Tangerine shatters casting conventions and its filmmaking techniques are up-to-the-minute, but it's an old-fashioned comedy at heart -- and a pretty wonderful one at that.
Outwardly, Gerwig creates a character who makes you cringe. At times, you are embarrassed for and by her. But, you also come to recognize that underneath, Brooke is a lost soul who really has no concrete life plan.	One energizing thing about this film is that it seems to defy any familiar pattern for a brisk hour or so before heading into straight-up screwball farce territory.	Moviegoers who sampled Baumbach's movies in the past and left with a bad taste in their mouths may do well to give "Mistress America" a chance. It's funny and poignant.	Despite clocking in at a skinny 84 minutes, Mistress America overstays its welcome.	Much like Brooke's proposed restaurant, Mistress America is a mishmash of ideas that never really comes together.	Mistress America brings out the best in collaborators Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, distilling its star's charm and director's dark wit into a ferociously funny co-written story.
It received universal acclaim upon its release in 1960, and in retrospect it's the work that best represents its director.	It comes from a period in which the filmmaker was perched between neorealism and all-out fantasia. As such, it represents the best of two worlds, even as Marcello can't find contentment in either one.	It's just perfect.	This remains a landmark movie that should be seen by every self-respecting movie buff.	In spite of its thematic ugliness, this is a stunning-looking trawl through the Italian capital, with Ekberg's impromptu paddle in the Trevi fountain still the films enduring image.	An epic, breathtakingly stylish cinematic landmark, La Dolce Vita remains riveting in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- its sprawling length.
A weird, off-the-wall bit of surrealistic nonsense that should keep the kiddies transfixed with its colorful characters and slapstick mayhem while amusing adults.	adults will marvel at the surreal complexity of singing state maps and a roadster trip that looks like it sprang off a Monopoly board	A small-scale charmer that gives audiences a healthy dose of silliness.	Joy! An animated feature that parents don't have to silently groan through.	Disney's Teacher's Pet tries hard to be a musical in the form of a quirky animated kid's movie, but ultimately it can't get past the inanity of it all.	Despite its short running time, Teacher's Pet is a witty and irreverent family film.
Quite possibly the least essential movie ever made. A call to arming the elderly.	Oh dear...oh dear, oh dear...	What's so amazing about the Police Academy movies is that they keep being made even though they stopped being funny after the hilarious original.	More of the same from the wackiest police force on the streets, and their newly recruited civilian helpers.	They really did just keep getting worse and worse.	Utterly, completely, thoroughly and astonishingly unfunny, Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol sends a once-innocuous franchise plummeting to agonizing new depths.
In short, this is a masterpiece.	A gem of art cinema and a miracle of animal-wrangling.	The film's apparent simplicity is, in large measure, its charm and its universal appeal.	Explaining it makes it sound aridly abstract, but watching it is pure delight...	Give Le Quattro Volte the patience it deserves, and you will be captivated by its stately rhythms, transfixed by its strange imagery, and moved by its sudden dramas. Don't, and you'll be bored to tears.	Birth, death, and transformation are examined in Le Quattro Volte, a profound and often funny mediation on the cycles of life on earth.
Karol Karol embodies his homeland, going for broke--in criminal fashion, if necessary--to stake its claim as a player in the European landscape. [Blu-ray]	an odd seriocomic film	The film works fine on its own.	Bookended as it is by Blue and Red, the second film in Kieslowski's liberty/ equality/ fraternity trilogy is a welcome relief from the sometimes tragic sensibility of the other two films.	The movie's feel is that of a short story made into a movie.	Taking a lighter tone than the other films of the Three Colors trilogy, White is a witty, bittersweet comedy with heavier themes on its mind than one might at first realize.
To fall for Vantage Point you have to throw away any connection to reality.	Watchably silly at best, it's the political thriller as an unintentional comedy of errors - 24 meets Noises Off.	If you thought 24's perspective on terrorism was, well, limited, get ready to groan. The meat and potatoes of Vantage Point -- the suicide bomb explosions, the bloody fisticuffs and blaring car chases -- are indeed awesome, and that's what truly matters f	If you are looking for mindless action, it's not bad. But since this is trying to be something more than that, I can't quite recommend it.	Vantage Point prefers to stick with the familiar, so that it ends up, bizarrely enough, affirming rather than challenging the viewer's prejudices.	Vantage Point has an interesting premise that is completely undermined by fractured storytelling and wooden performances.
Ultimately fails to come through in the fire-breathing clutch.	A great big summer effects movie that makes very little sense but provides a wild ride.	'Question: Why are the men in a ravaged England of 2020 denied access to razors and soap, while the women still enjoy the comforts of MAC cosmetics? Just asking.'	The movie is cold, miscalculated and hollow, and aside from a few isolated scenes of genuine excitement, it's also rather dreary.	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise, but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness.	An enjoyable B-movie if you don't use your brain.
An enthusiastically deranged family adventure gussied up in a Christmas sweater, Rare Exports is a welcome addition to the Warped Holiday Movie canon.	Though it promises more than it ultimately delivers, this charming little holiday horror story is a welcome counterweight to the usual yuletide sentimentality.	An enjoyably dark Christmas adventure with striking character design and a terrific central idea, but the script doesn't seem to know what to do with it, so the action dips in the middle before rallying for a decent climax.	A clever horror-comedy...A must-see for anyone interested in a darker take on Christmas myths and traditions.	Like Bad Santa and Silent Night, Bloody Night, it's a Christmas movie that isn't for children. Quite whom it is for, I'm not totally sure.	Rare Exports is an unexpectedly delightful crossbreed of deadpan comedy and Christmas horror.
'2 Fast' '2 Furious' = "4 Pity's Sake, Spare Us No. 3,' Isn't much beyond the level of a repeat episode of 'Fastlane.'	A disappointing step downward ... betraying what simple vision the original film had.	Superficial? You betcha. But eye candy, attitude and humor abound in what amounts to a glorified Miami Vice episode complete with an undercover lawman who lives aboard a boat.	["2 Fast 2 Furious"] has an energy of its own that allows it to stand on its own two feet. Or, is that "on its own four tires"?	It's a pretty bold move to make a film for groups of young males about the latent sexual nature of the relationships in such groups - and this alone made 2 Fast, 2 Furious an unexpectedly hilarious treat.	Beautiful people and beautiful cars in a movie that won't tax the brain cells.
"Tomorrow" is less realistic than "Red Dawn," if you can wrap your head around that without making it pop off.	This is cringe-worthy commercial cinema of the worst kind.	A bright idea let down by some spectacularly wooden acting, a clunky script and implausible sequences.	Stuart Beattie's Tomorrow, When The War Began is one of the best action blockbusters to ever emerge from Australia (even if it fails somewhat as a teen drama).	As an experienced screenwriter, Beattie (whose credits include Collateral and the first Pirates of the Caribbean) could have done a better job of polishing the TWTWB script.	While the script isn't amazing and the story's race issues linger, this adaptation of John Marsden's book is an exciting, action-heavy adventure that should please fans of the series.
The Ground Truth powerfully documents the human cost of the Iraq war.	...loses a grand opportunity: to preach to the unconverted.	I don't pretend to understand the pressures facing U.S. troops in Iraq, but I feel a little closer after witnessing The Ground Truth.	perhaps the most important protest statement yet committed to film since the outbreak of [the Iraq War]	A stunning statement on how we mistreat our best and bravest young men.	The stories the soldiers have to tell are eye-opening and wrenching to hear; collectively it's a searing peek into the toll of war both during and after.
If this unemployed gofer can land a date with a superstar, maybe there's hope for all of us.	[Barrymore's] radiant, sexy 'n' sweet manner provides a happy heart for this silly little love song of a movie.	Not only is that message loud and clear but the movie is also funny, exciting and awkward as we literally go through every emotion with the extremely self-conscious Herzlinger.	Watching My Date With Drew is like being party to the slow, poisoning death of the documentary.	Adorable doc with the 'Super Size Me' template.	A love-it-or-hate-it stalkerazzi documentary, My Date With Drew effectively draws on America's celeb-obsessed pop culture so that viewers either unabashedly identify with it, or are filing restraining orders on Drew Barrymore's behalf.
If not quite one of the worst sequels ever made, it's near the top of the list of all-time most disappointing sequels. Writer-director Stallone stupidly attempts to turn Tony Manero into a dancing Rocky.	All could be forgiven if it weren't for the soulless overall slickness.	[Sylvester Stallone] pours lots of energy but little intelligence into scads of short, sweaty scenes more suited to the rhythms of cable-TV ''rock video'' than to the wide screen.	Saturday Night Fever through the eyes of Stallone.	A sequel with no understanding of what made its predecessor work.	This sequel to Saturday Night Fever is shockingly embarrassing and unnecessary, trading the original's dramatic depth for a series of uninspired dance sequences.
The End of the Tour is a piece for its performers. Jason Segal's performance as Wallace won't just be talked about in the months to come, but in the years to come.	Segel's essential sweetness nicely serves the role of a guarded man who makes an unexpected new friend and maybe reveals more of himself than he intends.	The film, despite its flatness, is worth exploring, just as the writer's unremarkable home is picked apart by Lipsky, who prowls around like a cop, noting the contents of the bathroom cabinet and the photograph of Updike on the wall.	A thoughtful, moving testament to genuine connection.	A deeply human study of the internal impulses we indulge or hide, whether that pertains to intellect, attraction, emptiness or otherwise.	Brilliantly performed and smartly unconventional, The End of the Tour pays fitting tribute to a singular talent while offering profoundly poignant observations on the human condition.
Nothing but an inane popcorn flick pretending to be edgy.	A pesar de algunas cosas notorias en su aspecto visual, no deja de ser una más del género	This is the definition of empty (and empty-headed) entertainment, willing to stoop to any level to goose a weary and jaded audience.	"Enigmatic cyber-crime caper that blasts in as an intense, action-packed, fast-paced, dynamite thriller."	Strictly style above content, to the point that even cracking is shown as being a bit like Tetris	Swordfish is big on explosions, but critics dislike how it skimps on plot and logic. Also, the sight of a person typing at a computer just isn't that interesting.
In the end, it's more gumshoe mystery than action-adventure and, comparative to almost everything that followed, very low-key. But legends must start somewhere, and looking back at its reminders of how Bond wasn't always "Bond" are fascinating.	The low-key mystery plot and the resolutely human-sized drama of it all makes this one of the sanest of all Bond pictures.	It's terrific entertainment, to be sure, but its unevenness keeps up from being a great film.	Of course, it's dated -- a Sunbean Alpine isn't exactly cutting edge transport -- but the elegant playboy spy with just a whiff of danger was clearly here to stay.	It is noteworthy that a single film contains such a wealth of icons.	Featuring plenty of the humor, action, and escapist thrills the series would become known for, Dr. No kicks off the Bond franchise in style.
With a star turn like that at its center, a movie doesn't need too much more, but Dreamgirls has plenty to go around. Its sense of showmanship is overflowing.	This is a big, brassy, sometimes messy, often electric musical experience.	However, most of the great musicals from the 1930s and '40s did too, and it was the music and dancing which saved them. This is the case here, as well.	I have to admit that the film's spectacular performances and production values will blow you away much of the time -- and for that, Mr. Condon and his many colleagues deserve to be commended.	A dream come true? Not quite. But enough sass and brass -- plus a crucial touch of class -- to spark dreams of an at-long-last musical revival.	Dreamgirls' simple characters and plot hardly detract from the movie's real feats: the electrifying performances and the dazzling musical numbers.
[Director] Karslake balances the more emotional elements of the film together with the scriptural analysis and weaves them into a moving conclusion.	Will likely find itself preaching to the converted, but its moving true stories are powerful enough to affect anyone open to listening.	While the film is unlikely to sway anyone whose mind already isn't made up, it provides plenty food for thought in its examination of biblical doctrine on same-sex love and how it resonates to this day.	The point that the homophobic right is picking and choosing which parts of the Bible to follow, and which verses to look at in the context in which they were written, is both terribly familiar and rudimentarily argued.	As long as it's dissecting the six or seven passages in the Bible that ostensibly disparage homosexuality, this documentary ode to tolerance takes a shrewd look at how speciously selective and ahistorical the church condemnation of gays really is.	A timely and poignant examination of gays, their families and religion.
Many, I suspect, will be moved to tears by "Love Is Strange," which Sachs earns the hard way: not by amping up the dramatic situations, but by grace notes and quiet spells cast by all the right actors.	The movie, which feels a bit like a mashup of Woody Allen and Mike Leigh, succeeds on its simple story and its lead actors.	'Love is Strange' has more in common with bad houseguest movies - like the Turkish film 'Distant,' if not 'Houseguest' - than 'Philadelphia' or 'Prick Up Your Ears.'	And the bravura final 15 minutes: dear God in Manhattan! ... one lyrical, cinematic wallop after another... What was very, very good, with modest leaps beyond plausibility, reaches for authentic greatness.	It's a mature and subtle piece of storytelling, and as delicate and lovely as the classical compositions by Frėdėric Chopin that play on the film's soundtrack.	Held aloft by remarkable performances from John Lithgow and Alfred Molina, Love Is Strange serves as a graceful tribute to the beauty of commitment in the face of adversity.
Sit-com stuff, then, with laboured farcical interludes, and a mushy post-feminist sensibility. Funny notwithstanding.	One of Robin William's funniest films to date...an absolute beauty!	An overactive, cheeky costume comedy highlighted by the inspired zaniness of Robin Williams	Rousing comic portrait of a dad who loves his kinds more than anything else in the world.	The dress, the mask and Mrs. Doubtfire's gentility are inherently limiting, but nothing holds Mr. Williams back when he's on a roll.	On paper, Mrs. Doubtfire might seem excessively broad or sentimental, but Robin Williams shines so brightly in the title role that the end result is difficult to resist.
Effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience.	Although the movie takes us further into the actual process of industrial death at Auschwitz than any American movie has yet dared, The Grey Zone never stoops to sensation or melodrama.	As bold and unyielding as The Grey Zone stands with its historical subtext, there are a few factors detracting from the powerful message.	[Nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised, unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes.	[Blake] creates moments ... that are impossible to forget.	A grim and devastating tale of the Holocaust.
An instant popcorn classic.	It's as if the director, the gifted Brian De Palma, rises to the occasions but the screenplay gives him nothing much to do in between them.	Despite a few breathtaking snapshots en route, it can't quite figure out the aesthetic itinerary -- where it's heading and why.	Like milk or a musical chord, a movie script is most noticeable when it is spoiled.	Utterly devoid not just of inspiration but energy, too.	Beauty only goes skin deep in this shallow but visually stunning film.
A heartbreaking, life-enhancing experience, one of the screen's finest portrayals of infidelity and its consequences.	There's a real emotional heft to it, and the performances are superb.	At once harsh and beautiful, lucid and dense, delicate and overwhelming.	If Ullmann has unquestionably appropriated from her years with Bergman (and Josephson) a magnificent empathy with her players, she is also rewardingly attentive to visual detail.	Bien realizada, bien dirigida y mucho mejor actuada	This brooding, measured look at adultery is ultimately emotionally riveting, thanks to its script and performances.
Rather like its subject's books--pretty to look at, sweet without being syrupy and cute without being cloying, but rather thin.	Criticizing such a gentle film too vigorously would be like giving Peter Rabbit or Tom Kitten a swift kick in the nose.	The overall effect is a solid one-hour love story followed by a dramatized Wikipedia entry.	Miss Potter is too well crafted to actually be bad, but it's too light to be better than good. An entertaining trifle, but a trifle nonetheless.	While it cannot sustain the fairytale enchantment of something like Finding Neverland, Miss Potter is, nonetheless, a worthy and sweet, middle-of-the-road biopic.	A charming biopic that maintains its sweetness even in sadder moments.
It's a bold first effort, with a distinct, swaggering sense of style and humor that's hard -- even for a cynical blogger sick to death of indie 'quirk' -- to resist.	Though it goes a bit wonky toward the end and seems to travel a very long way to drive home a rather simple point, Wristcutters: A Love Story remains a wonderfully evocative experience.	It's borderline parody of a kind of fey filmmaking popular at crunchy-granola festivals, but the counterfeit aesthetic is ultimately outshone by the life-affirming message.	It misses the opportunity to examine why a community of people - each of whom has already given up on life - would band together to form a new society of desperate misfits.	This existential tale about an afterworld exclusively for suicide victims and a handful of newcomers attempting to navigate the landscape pulsates originality through its uncanny way of incorporating the familiar into the offbeat.	Wristcutters: A Love Story sounds like a normal enough indie flick. Boy meets girl. Boy gets separated from girl. Boy goes on a road trip with friends to find girl and gains a new perspective on life. Except everybody's dead.
. A master at understatement, [director Kelly] Reichardt elicits very effective, subdued performances from her key cast, who have to keep the lid on their emotions almost all of the time.	A disquietingly beautiful, deeply intelligent thriller about radical activism and its consequences - both material and moral - in 21st century America.	The anxious eco-thriller "Night Moves" plays like a saboteur's procedural.	It's a richly engrossing drama, so long as you understand that it's aiming for the head, not the gut.	Reichardt probes away at her characters' motivations and contradictory feelings. She doesn't judge them, but makes it very clear how quickly their idealism becomes muddied once they dirty their hands with direct action.	A uniquely character-driven thriller with a finely composed cast and some outstanding direction from Kelly Reichardt, Night Moves bolsters its thought-provoking themes with compelling drama.
Traces the band's 20-year odyssey in creating Dada you can dance to.	You'll find yourself donning that wonderful half-smile John L. comfortably dons while singing.	Suffers the same banal fate of most band documentaries. It's essential for rabid fans but even ordinary ones will live rich and meaningful lives without ever having seen one minute of it.	recalls "The Compleat Beatles" in its ability to show a band's evolution artistically and historically	The flabby, fawning film Gigantic comes across as 102 minutes of rib-nudging by one of the duo's annoyingly self-satisfied connoisseurs.	A clever, absorbing documentary about They Might Be Giants, a musical duo whose brainy, idiosyncratic brand of pop has earned them decades of cult success.
I'm all for a young British film-maker trying to subvert the stock traditions of boy-meets-girl, and Ayoade is clearly unafraid of experiment. But I would have traded all of its new wave dottiness and knowing whimsicality for a few spontaneous laughs.	Smart and sly, funny and fourth-wall-breaking... but above all, an excruciatingly accurate coming-of-ager.	Ayoade doesn't ape [Wes] Anderson, but he achieves similar magic, delivering a sad, funny little film that takes no shame in its visual influences.	Submarine successfully combines the quirky and the sweet, in this representation of adolescence in all of its messy, overdramatic, and bumbling glory.	For an hour Ayoade, a comedian in his alternative career, mixes zany visual inventiveness and deadpan-perfect tonal holding patterns.	Funny, stylish, and ringing with adolescent truth, Submarine marks Richard Ayoade as a talent to watch.
Not deep, but definitely funny--teens will enjoy.	Notting Hill is about as enchanting as movies get these days!	This is a perfect example of how good 'mainstream' movies can be.	Grant's sly, boyish, infallibly halting charm makes him, if not the new Cary Grant, unbeatably the new David Niven.	The winning romantic comedy every summer not only awaits, but counts on!	Charming performances provide romance aplenty.
Okay, so it's a placeholder. But it's a really good placeholder.	This is the least involving of the series so far, with an unclear storyline and action set-pieces that fail to convey the excitement of the book.	We're still wild about Harry and this - basically - sets the stage for the seventh - and final - book which will be divided into two movies.	The sixth installment of the series is entertaining and passes the time but it suffers from the same anti-climactic feeling as the last film.	They should cast Will Smith as the Half-Fresh Prince. Then I'd be interested.	Dark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is also visually stunning and emotionally satisfying.
A blisteringly askew tale of how you don't have to be good at a sport to succeed, just know your role.	Goon is crude, violent and deeply enjoyable.	Scott isn't bad: He sells the comedy of his character's ingrained politeness as much as the aggression. But "Goon" feels like a movie starring a gimmick, not a person.	It takes hockey hooliganism to heights not seen since Slap Shot was offending the nation's finger-waggers back in the 1970s.	It's the kind of small-budget comedy that earns your goodwill early and easily, even if it isn't breaking new ground or transcending its readily apparent monetary constraints.	Goon is a crude slapstick comedy with well-formed characters and a surprising amount of heart.
Though it may damage my credibility as a respectable movie critic, I'll proudly list Resident Evil on my list of this year's guilty pleasures.	The film's modest and campy success hangs on the magnificent screen presence of Milla Jovovich, an angelic warrior clad in a red dinner dress and black combat boots, with piercing blue eyes.	What will, most likely, turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002.	This is an arcade game, designed to deliver thrills and chills. This is does.	In the category of zombie movies, this is top shelf.	Like other video game adapations, Resident Evil is loud, violent, formulaic, and cheesy.
Terrific entertainment, and startlingly shrewd in the bargain, a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh, as you gape, at their thunderous extravagance.	Live Free is an homage to itself -- unpretentious, yet not campy -- a nostalgic and enjoyable thrill ride.	Movie characters like McClane are the Paul Bunyans and John Henrys and Pecos Bills of our age, the stuff of tall tales spun with the technology of an age whose campfires are found in multiplexes with stadium seating.	Send John McClane to Iraq. Even the title of 'Live Free or Die Hard' suggests that Bruce Willis' supercop is just the one-man troop surge the President needs to restore order to the world's No. 2 failed state.	Like McClane himself, this is an analog movie in a digital world -- proudly outdated, yet guaranteed to get the job done.	Live Free or Die Hard may be preposterous, but it's an efficient, action-packed summer popcorn flick with thrilling stunts and a commanding performance by Bruce Willis. Fans of the previous Die Hard films will not be disappointed.
The film is a musical, but the numbers, while pleasant enough, are not at all memorable.	Fun, light Disney cartoon.	The real beauty of the picture, which is as amusing, smoothly machined and beautifully colored as any Disney should be, is in the characterizations, sustained within a sprightly but simple format.	A cute, feline version of "Lady and the Tramp" that should enthrall families . . . and, of course, cat lovers.	An enjoyable mix of fine animation, catchy songs, and outstanding voice characterizations.	Though The Aristocats is a mostly middling effort for Disney, it is redeemed by terrific work from its voice cast and some jazzy tunes.
There is too much to be absorbed in too little time and not enough tissue connecting abbreviated, sometimes unnecessary subplots.	Had the film stood still more often, its stylish gambit would have worked better.	A stylish if familiar tale of a man hopelessly entangled in his past.	Monahan's trademark tart dialogue is as strong as ever, and Farrell and Winstone make for a formidable pair of opponents.	Essentially, London Boulevard is a long but not very winding road.	In spite of its spotless pedigree and a strong sense of visual style, London Boulevard stumbles over its frenetic pace and crowded, clichéd plot.
You know a sci-fi action film is failing when even the outfits are bad.	Aeon Flux is by far the year's worst movie, a most dubious achievement.	The performances are plastic...	The film has lots of violence, but there aren't any consequences -- it's like a videogame, where the worst thing that could happen is you have to start over.	The tag line is, 'The Future Is Flux.' Personally, I think they left the 'ed' off that last word, and it's not only the future that's in this state, but the movie itself.	Aeon Flux lacks the gravity-defying pace of its animated predecessor, and, despite some flash, is largely a dull affair.
This horrific teen romance-cum-weepie is best watched from between your fingers, or from under your seat, or perhaps standing outside the cinema looking in the opposite direction.	Too-syrupy re-tread of Love Story.	Director Shankman ditches character development in favour of delivering an exploitative date movie and dubiously conservative moral lesson.	Adopts a breezy anti-cynicism as a pose, and then spends the rest of the time failing in the most spectacular way to competently execute it.	A monstrosity of a movie that I am all too eager to forget.	Though wholesome, the Mandy Moore vehicle A Walk to Remember is also bland and oppressively syrupy.
It's as strong a document about the pleasure and pain of rock 'n' roll as has been seen in years.	A satisfying, straightforward documentary with great archive footage and interviews with band members ... and those they influenced.	Necessary viewing for any music fan.	Unvarnished and raw as the punk pioneers whose turbulent trajectory it traces, End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones is a true fan's nirvana.	Chronicles their 30-year history in a style befitting the band: bare-bones, frank, nonsensationalized and adamantly unsentimental.	Gabba gabba hey! With its focus on the groundbreaking work of the 1970s punk band The Ramones End of the Century makes a solid entry into the growing canon of documentaries that capture Punkology.
If the film's mod trappings seem locked in a specific (and increasingly distant) era, its playful wit remains timeless.	A zesty, satisfying celebration of animation, fantasy, love, and the Beatles that pleases the eyes as much as the ears.	The music and images take the film into uncharted territory and you never know where the film will go next.	A unique and often brilliant animated film that pictures the Beatles as towering and often god-like gentlemen who have the power to change worlds...	What a trip.	A joyful, phantasmagoric blend of colorful animation and the music of the Beatles, Yellow Submarine is delightful (and occasionally melancholy) family fare.
ADD auds won't mind that there's no time to get to know anybody, or watch a relationship unfold, or ride the dramatic rise and swell of a compelling narrative.	The futuristic film is just as gripping and moving as the best-seller on which it's based.	Viewers can hope future installments retain this same thoughtful approach that works on multiple levels.	It doesn't help, either, that star Lawrence delivers a consistently competent yet wholly uncharismatic performance...	Both fans of the books and those brand new to the story of Katniss Everdeen will find The Hunger Games compelling. With the first film proving the series is in good hands, I'm excited to see the next chapters play out onscreen.	Thrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel.
Why then should anyone of sane disposition wish to see the film? Because it is still a love story, and a very touching one at that.	Forget Jack and Rose; forget Doctor Zhivago and Larissa; forget Lady and the Tramp. This love story between Sid and Nancy is one of the most fascinating ones you'll ever see.	Though dark and harrowing, explicit and unsparing, the movie proves a riveting biography of these burnt-out icons and their iconoclastic half-decade.	A kick-your-teeth-in salute to Punkdom's self-immolating First Couple.	Alex Cox's best film by far.	Visceral, energetic, and often very sad, Sid & Nancy is also a surprisingly touching love story, and Gary Oldman is outstanding as the late punk rock icon Sid Vicious.
Bouchareb nobly honors men whose sacrifices have largely gone unnoticed.	[Rachid] Bouchareb's movie combines convention with insight in a manner that may prevent it from being a great film but probably helped clinch it as a productive one.	Beautifully photographed, impeccably produced and wonderfully acted, but it offers no surprises...	It occasionally does drop into wartime cliches of love lost and friends fallen. But the chest-thwack poinancy of those who shed blood and were shamefully shunned drags you through.	Powerful tale of African soldiers fighting Nazis and the racism of their French officers.	Days of Glory is a powerful historical epic that pays homage to a valiant group of soldiers whose sacrifices have largely been forgotten.
Charlotte Sometimes nails the subtle psychotic element that circles budding relationships.	Drawing on an irresistible, languid romanticism, Byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth.	Capably shot and acted, with a fine feel for loneliness, Eric Byler's film is a mood sonata with little concern about being Asian; it is only PC in the sense of 'painfully coy.'	Charlotte Sometimes is a gem. It's always enthralling.	A sexy, surprising romance... Idemoto and Kim make a gorgeous pair... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger.	Featuring an attractive young cast, Charlotte mostly shines as a portrait of the sexual frolics and hangups of L.A. Asian twentysomethings.
It's fast, short, restlessly plotted and, at times, pure bananas.	Thinking (logically or otherwise) about this movie is a waste of your brain cells.	...do not under any circumstances rent this if you've never seen the Highlander TV series.	A slow-moving piece of garbage with choppy fight sequences and bad acting.	The fourth sequel to a film designed to stand alone... In the end, there should have been only one.	The fourth and supposedly last Highlander movie is a confusing mess, complete with bad acting and dialogue.
It's a watershed moment in Van Damme's career; the moment you realise the crazy bastard really can act. It's a tragedy of sorts that most of his fans won't even care.	The gentler Van Damme may disappear after just two pictures. If he does, I'm happy at least to have made his acquaintance.	Jean-Claude Van Damme escapes the pound-bin for a clever action-hero satire.	Despite sounding like a mutated variant of a sexually transmitted disease, JCVD is infectious for all the right reasons.	A real departure for Van Dame, but it ought to help his career. Who knew he could act?	JCVD is a touching, fascinating piece, with Jean-Claude Van Damme confounding all with his heartfelt performance.
[Director Jeffrey] Schwartz has made a film that would impress Divine's biggest fan: himself. It's all about Divine, darling and don't you forget it.	The film's heart is the chequered relationship Milstead had with his mother, whose shifting regard for her larger-than-life son takes centre stage.	A viewer could suffer whiplash just from how much [Divine] and pop culture changed in the course of 20 years.	Affectionate, informative and genuinely entertaining.	In "I Am Divine," bolstered by plentiful interviews with Waters and other collaborators, Schwarz effectively turns Milstead into the life of a party that didn't really end with his death in 1988.	With warmth and affection, I Am Divine offers an engaging portrait of the complex personality behind a trailblazing cinematic figure.
Neither hot nor square, it's as simple and earnest as any after-school special and as cameo-laden as any rap video.	The film remains watchable in the ways that delightful musicals tend to be...	Honey passes the time nicely up to that last dance and doesn't trip when it gets there.	Overreaches its niche as a glammed-up music video and can't survive with everything but the kitchen sink crammed in.	It's really a Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney "Let's put on a show" movie set in the South Bronx.	An attractive Jessica Alba and energetic dance numbers provide some lift to this corny and formulaic movie.
Why?	Arthur could have been a caring and heartfelt comedy, but the tone is mixed, and the narrative missteps on all the wrong notes.	Russell buys Abe Lincoln's stovepipe hat and wears it for the rest of this movie despite numerous autograph seekers requesting the guitar licks from Welcome to the Jungle.	...a perfectly respectable remake that is too often foiled by its reliance on hackneyed elements...	The original "Arthur" was harmless. The new one is charmless.	An irritating, unnecessary remake that demonstrates the libertine charm Russell Brand exudes in supporting roles turn against him when he's star of the show.
click to read full review [Greek]	Jackson is key to keeping Snakes on a Plane from slithering into complete preposterousness.	a cheesy, B-movie thrill ride with a lot of action, over-the-top special effects and a super cool leading man.	...offers some surprises, most notably an amusing parody of the original 1970's disaster flick Airport...	All anyone really needs to know about this amusingly crude, honestly satisfying artifact is snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson.	Snakes on a Plane lives up to its title, featuring snakes on a plane. It isn't perfect, but then again, it doesn't need to be.
For all of you hungry-for-decent-comic-fare, Polly is a whole lotta ho-hum, a limping script with a few charming dimples.	Every truly successful raunchy romantic comedy has at its heart a couple worth rooting for. This one doesn't.	Another high-brow laugher that delights in running (Ben Stiller) through the ringer.	Talented actors in dumb film with gross sex humor.	A romantic comedy whose no-holds-barred gross-out elements sour an already graceless mix of crude pratfalls and heartache.	Though the supporting actors are funny, Stiller and Aniston don't make a believable couple, and the gross-out humor is gratuitous.
A good deal smarter than most big-budget romantic comedies, but its shrillness makes it less pleasurable than it should be.	Bell makes a promising directorial debut with this quirky low-budget comedy.	Sweet, witty and exquisitely observed, In A World... sees the emergence of an exciting talent: any agents looking for a new triple threat should ring that Bell.	Mostly it's about family - about sisterly bonding, about domineering fathers, about long-lost, still-missed mothers. About any adult child's fight to establish herself as an independent entity.	Bell's revelation is that females (even high-achieving ones) are surprisingly likely to use a voice that suggests they're an ickle-wickle pushover.	A funny, well-written screwball satire for film buffs, In a World... proves an auspicious beginning for writer, director, and star Lake Bell.
Biting irony and an unusual combination of grounded reality and quirky fantasy, occasionally slipping into puzzling obscurity.	Life in the Arab-Israeli region has a random and arbitrary unintelligibility, if this surreal stylization validly reflects it. But, validity comes into question.	An imaginative and daring Palestinian film about the fights and feuds in Nazareth that have shredded community life and banished civility under the terror of Israeli occupation.	Divine Intervention is very clear that the conflict in the Middle East is all one big farce.	El director hilvana sensaciones, alegorías, representaciones más bien absurdas, e inspiradas en el cine mudo o la comedia física de Buster Keaton o Jacques Tati.	Suleiman utilizes absurdist humor to craft a provocative, original film.
An endearing life story. Wonderfully nostalgic but also heart-wrenching at times for anyone who grew up with the support of PBS's Children's Television Workshop.	Four years after "Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey" promoted the idea that a Muppet character embodied love, along come the documentarian duo Dave LaMattina and Chad N. Walker to reinstate the legacy of Sesame Street's original star.	Perhaps a sharper exploration of Spinney's life isn't presented, but the documentary gets by on the basics, supplying a new perspective on the puppeteer and his legacy.	Schmaltz continually threatens to overcome genius in this super-sentimental account of gifted puppeteer Caroll Spinney.	The film gets a little syrupy at times, but Mr. Spinney is forthright and engaging throughout.	Every bit as good-natured as longtime fans might hope, I Am Big Bird: The Carroll Spinney Story offers heartwarming behind-the-scenes perspective on a cultural icon.
Let Me In mimics the mood and mastery of Alfredson?s original almost to the point where it's a shot for shot remake. Yes, it?s good. But only because the original was good to begin with.	What more could you want? Great reviews, awards-season glory, lousy ticket sales. Maybe Reeves made an art movie after all.	Let Me In is the rare remake that maintains the strengths of the original while staking out new ground.	Reeves' direction is a subdued, safe, clean -- and a bit boring.	[Reeves] has taken someone else's work and so infused it with apt and knowing choices that if feels as if it began with him personally -- a heck of a thing to achieve with such a potentially dubious project.	Similar to the original in all the right ways -- but with enough changes to stand on its own -- Let Me In is the rare Hollywood remake that doesn't add insult to inspiration.
If scenes of extreme gore being played for dark laughs disturb you, you sure ain't the target audience here.	As entertaining as Punisher: War Zone is, there's no real depth, the plot is obvious and it's a wee bit charmless.	If at first you don't succeed, punish, punish again.	If you can stomach the gore and pick up on the underlying humor, you'll likely have a good time.	It's a good old-fashioned guns-andaction romp - and I love it.	Punisher: War Zone recalls the excessively violent, dialogue-challenged actioners of the 1980s, and coincidentally feels two decades out of date.
Nice performances all around and a lighter-than-expected dusting of sugary sweetness keeps it just this side of insufferable.	Son of the Bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness.	A sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears.	A pleasant and sometimes heartwarming two hours' diversion.	Has the feel of an unedited personal journal.	A film about one man's mid-life crisis, The Son of the Bride is both touching and funny.
It's smart, funny and insightful and it's quite easy to see what attracted the stars to it.	You probably don't need to run out to a theater to see The Big Kahuna.	The Big Kahuna is best taken as an acting showcase for DeVito (whose low-key, deeply affecting performance is unlike anything he's done before) and Spacey.	Revolving around three characters in a hotel room, this modest yet engaging film tackles the big issues -- life, death, religion -- with enough humor and insight to overcome its familiar setup.	Sharp-edged, perfectly timed, funny and thoughtful.	Wonderful adaptation of the stage play.
The only 'samurai' that counts is the Hollywood top blade named Cruise.	A harrowing tale of honor, simple beauty, self-discovery, and ferocious conviction.	As Algren's fiercely principled captor-turned- mentor, Watanabe ultimately reveals himself to be the movie's real star.	That maxim about familiarity breeding contempt doesn't apply here: For all its recognizable trappings, this is an enormously entertaining film.	Delivers thrilling action, gorgeous cinematography, beautiful locations and Oscar-worthy performances.	With high production values and thrilling battle scenes, The Last Samurai is a satisfying epic.
Just like the Stock Market, this movie suffers from some pretty scary highs and lows.	After his attempts to branch out slightly with World Trade Center and W., Money Never Sleeps finds Stone at ease in a way he hasn't been in years.	Stone and the script shortchange the characters, forcing them to do things that seem phony and having them recite lines that sound stilted and overly didactic.	A swift and engaging financial thriller (is that a thing?) that addresses matters of morality without too much moralizing.	For me, the basic problem with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is simple: Oliver Stone's rage is missing this time.	It's more entertaining than many sequels, but with Oliver Stone directing, a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should be better.
This one is strictly for James' hard-core fans and anyone wishing to witness the sole appearance of the once-mighty MGM lion on a new feature this year.	Zookeeper is a charming and lovably imperfect film.	In which Kevin James yet again proves his absolute unfitness (in both senses) for the part of romantic comedy lead.	If it's a choice between this and mucking-out duty, pass the shovel.	Ultimately, it's a marketing pitch in search of a movie that proves punishingly flat, with even the slapstick so sparsely delivered as to replicate a long slog through the zoo, surrounded by fidgety kids, on a suffocating summer's day.	Zookeeper smothers Kevin James's with a sodden script and a surfeit of jokes inappropriate for the young viewers who would be intrigued by its juvenile storyline.
It's got heart and it's got style -- what's missing is laughs.	With its charming characters and nonstop jokes, this movie is worth crossing the road to see.	It has a fresh visual style and keeps the bodily function jokes to a minimum (like Pixar), but they also stuffed the movie to the gills with pop song after pop song.	The animators and voice actors have a great deal of sly fun bringing this misfit foursome to life.	Given Disney's marketing muscle, most kids will probably se Chicken Little whether they want to or not.	In its first non-Pixar CGI venture, Disney expends more effort in the technical presentation than in crafting an original storyline.
The film's genius lies in Mr. Anderson's brilliant construction, which weaves the stories together with dazzling elegance.	A powerful drama of intertwined stories that contemplates the co-existence of the past with our present and future.	If it is emotional cinema you seek then this, my friends, is for you.	Magnolia is real, full-tilt filmmaking, seducing our souls and nervous systems with a sensory, kinesthetic rush.	How did Paul Thomas Anderson attain the pinnacle of self-indulgence so quickly?	Critics say Magnolia is an ambitious, lengthy work that ultimately succeeds due to the interesting stories and excellent ensemble performances.
As horror, it's only mildly chilling. As anything more serious, it's half-hearted and intellectually not up to the challenge, great cast or no.	Legal drama that's no more special or sophisticated than anything playing on TV these days.	While scary in parts, Exorcism actually works as a taut legal thriller.	It uses the horror genre to say something and, despite some elements that could have been stronger, it generally succeeds.	The courtroom shenanigans drain the suspense from Emily's story and, frankly, they're not very convincing.	Loosely based on a true story, The Exorcism of Emily Rose mixes compelling courtroom drama with generally gore-free scares in a ho-hum take on demonic cinema.
Okay romantic comedy, but I never got what the fuss was about.	Norman Jewison's romantic comedy is likeable and amusing, featuring Oscar-winning turns from Cher and Olympia Dukakis	A superior romantic comedy, with more than a touch of grace and warmth, and without resorting to the usual stupid romantic comedy clichés.	Stronger on mores than amore, a half smile for a summer night.	A wholesome, filling glimpse at what happens when people rediscover their appetite for love.	Led by energetic performances from Nicolas Cage and Cher, Moonstruck is an exuberantly funny tribute to love and one of the decade's most appealing comedies.
Even less funny than Southland Tales and not nearly as adventurous.	This is broad satire spun completely out of control, overloaded with obvious gags and cannonades of yuks where quivers of sleeking wit ought to be.	Nice try, but this hallucinatory polemic never jells.	A disastrously heavy-handed satire...	Look at War, Inc as a back-flipping, over-the-top political farce, and the results are far more pleasurable. Consider the film an unofficial sequel to the 1997 classic Grosse Pointe Blank, and War, Inc. is absolutely wonderful.	War, Inc. attempts to satirize the military industrial complex, but more often than not it misses its target.
The ideal viewer would be, I guess, a 5-year-old who still thinks dinosaurs and urine jokes are cool, but realizes they pale in comparison with breasts and gropings.	By stringing together a bunch of campy retro set-ups and witty improvs, Land of the Lost manages to be a watchable comedy with plenty of laughs.	Not really a film version of the oft-rerun '70s Saturday morning staple that happens to star Will Ferrell, but rather a Will Ferrell movie that happens to bear the title and some concepts of the show.	Land of the Lost is only one hour and 36 minutes long, but it could easily be 15 minutes shorter without the scenes of Ferrell's meandering ad-libs.	It's a kind of cut-price Jurassic Park, with a support cast of gabbling monkeys and lizardish humanoids, and if they don't seem far-fetched you might believe Anna Friel as a Cambridge- educated scientist.	Only loosely based on the original TV series, Land of the Lost is decidedly less kid-friendly and feels more like a series of inconsistent sketches than a cohesive adventure comedy.
The best thing about the film is its bigheartedness. It's not out to mock these people, but rather to show how any person of any orientation can become unraveled when high-minded principles meet with base human instincts.	The film's main strength is the screenplay, co-written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg. It's perceptive and mercurial, perfectly in tune with the churning tensions within every family.	The acting in this film is so good, across the board, that it doesn't feel like acting; we're simply watching a family going through some drama (and comedy) over a summer before its eldest child leaves for college.	Such a low-key feat of filmmaking that the scope of its offhanded generosity -- toward its characters, its story, its actors and its audience -- may not hit you until days after you've seen it.	Cholodenko and her cast turn what could have been an utterly artificial story into a warm, funny, sharp-tongued and broiling examination of the volatility underlying even the happiest of families.	Worthwhile as both a well-acted ensemble piece and as a smart, warm statement on family values, The Kids Are All Right is remarkable.
A formidable prelude to an epic battle with resplendent effects and action spectacles.	John Woo returns to China to make a film he has been burning to make, an adaptation from the much read book, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, written in about the 14th century; many years after the events depicted, but then these events are as important in	The script is leaden but the action speaks volumes as Woo delivers an efficient spectacle of naval battles, slow-motion combat, death-defying stunt work, daredevil espionage, noble deeds, self-sacrifice and more plotting than a Labour Cabinet meeting.	After years of civil war, Prime Minister General Cao Cao attempts to unite the empire under the Han Dynasty by quashing two troublesome warlords.	It's almost 2 1/2 hours, and too much is corny, cramped, and vague.	Featuring some impressively grand battlefield action, John Woo returns to Asia and returns to form in the process for this lavish and slick historical epic.
A trio of horror pics, one, Dumpling, being the best, the other two just fine.	This is not for the faint of heart, stomach or any other vital organ.	Blood, grotesquerie and humor mix equally in the first two, but the full combo makes a savory witches' brew for Asian-cinema cultists (or Halloween lovers in need of a gore fix).	'Cut,' Park's contribution to Three... Extremes  Full Review | Original Score: 2/4	A satisfying trio of twisted tales.	This anthology contains brutal, powerful horror stories by three of Asia's top directors.
Smart and sassy, here is one helluva terrific word-of-mouth feature. Watch it, then tell all your friends to see it.	Gay or straight, Kissing Jessica Stein is one of the greatest date movies in years.	The performances are quite good, the screenplay is full of observant moments and sharp one-liners.	It frustrates me that this writing team would be so satisfied with just another humdrum New York romancer.	Amiable and even adventurous.	A trite but refreshing and comical spin on nature of love.
Dull and aimless and lacks even the slightest hint of heart.	While respectable enough on its own low terms, the picture is disappointingly conventional and unimaginative.	The screenplay, from William Broyles, Jr., Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal is one of the worst I've ever experienced.	Unimaginative fare, generic and humorless hero, banal villain.	...will forever be remembered as one of the most unforgivable remakes I've ever seen.	This remake of Planet of the Apes can't compare to the original in some critics' mind, but the striking visuals and B-movie charms may win you over.
If you only take your children to see movies like Up ... they'll think every film is going to be fantastic. That's not very good training for the disappointments of life, so Furry Vengeance does have one purpose.	Parental Content Review	This godawful excuse for family entertainment could have delivered a good eco message to kids, but instead it contents itself with rolling its lead around in an upended porto-potty.	Even professional judgment as faulty as Fraser's can't explain his presence in this fleabitten fiasco.	Witless and wince-inducing -- a slapstick misfire of epic proportions, even by downwardly adjusted expectations of movies in which anthropomorphized animals do battle with humans.	A thin premise stretched far beyond serviceable length, Furry Vengeance subjects Brendan Fraser -- and the audience -- to 92 minutes of abuse.
A well-acted if glibly configured statement about violence begetting violence on two continents.	There's little flash or surprise in Bier's latest well-shot film, but plenty of substance.	Bier, when she allows herself, loves the peripheral as much as the portentous. She understands that an image can tell more than words, more than even 1,000.	Essentially an essay about bullying ( ... ) and the abuse of power, it will probably be appreciated most by people who want to keep up with [Susanne] Bier's maturing catalogue.	Director Bier and her regular screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen construct a believable series of events where notions of Western civilisation as opposed to Third World moral disarray are put to the test.	In a Better World is a sumptuous melodrama that tackles some rather difficult existential and human themes.
If the format of Shrek 2 feels somewhat pinched and familiar, the writing does not.	Another don't-miss gem from DreamWorks.	Shrek 2 is one of the great movies of all time.	With a witty premise, an all-star cast and a show-stopping rendition of Holding Out For a Hero as the new movie anthem, what's not to love?	It's not so much a prediction as a no-brainer that "Shrek 2" is going to be very, very big this summer.	It may not be as fresh as the original, but topical humor and colorful secondary characters make Shrek 2 a winner in its own right.
When all else fails, and the last faint possibility of comedy has vanished, the director turns on the sentiment.	To put it bluntly, this trip isn't worth taking for the vast majority of movie-goers.	This is a frontrunner for worst film of the year, but a healthy $45m in the US means a sequel is likely - proof that education standards are indeed slipping.	Children might find the slapstick routines amusing, but for older viewers this is a mirthless voyage.	Undeniably fun for the kids, though it requires a camp sensibility in its adult audience. But in doing so, it is a warm return to the live-action Disney movies of yesteryear.	Filled with shrill gags and middling slapstick, College Road Trip is woefully short on comic imagination.
A meticulously complex story of guilt and paranoia.	...one of the better movies that I've seen so far this year.	A brilliant, harrowing performance by Bale.	A relentless and painful reminder of concentration camp terrors and famine relief operations.	Low-budget, high-shiver horror film is anchored by Christian Bale's unsettling portrait of insomnia.	Brad Anderson's dark psychological thriller about a sleepless factory worker is elevated by Christian Bale astonishingly committed performance.
Feels as if a dump truck has buried moviegoers in confetti and glitter for two hours.	Dazzling musical romance for teens.	A genuinely exhilarating experience. Moulin Rouge is like the best party ever, to the power of 10.	A breathtaking baroque film that marries the best of theatre, opera and cinematic technique.	The Best Film of 2001!	A love-it-or-hate-it experience, Moulin Rouge is all style, all giddy, over-the-top spectacle. But it's also daring in its vision and wildly original.
Rock solid.	A very easy movie to admire and almost impossible to enjoy. I spent most of the running time appreciating the artistry while wishing I could be anywhere else.	Forget motion-capture, this is motion-rapture. Meanwhile, Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (Up) finds some extraordinary piano notes to emphasise contemplative silence as much as imminent threat.	Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a summer blockbuster that defies what blockbusters are known for nowadays...	This installment inches events closer to a merge point with 1968's Planet of the Apes while maintaining its own unique identity. It is in every way superior to Rise of the Planet of the Apes.	With intelligence and emotional resonance to match its stunning special effects, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes expands on its predecessor with an exciting and ambitious burst of sci-fi achievement.
It's not exactly re-inventing the wheel but it's still a pleasant surprise.	There is not much substance to Geoff LaTulippe's screenplay, which mostly falls back on Apatow-style sex jokes and pop-culture riffs.	Documentary filmmaker Nanette Burstein brings a refreshing frankness to the goings-on (you don't see many rom-coms where people do bong hits on their first date and aren't punished for it), and the leads are awfully winning.	LaTulippe keeps things moving by maintaining the tension these two people, who seem to be perfect for each other, have in not wanting to choose between love and career, with them wisecracking,weeping and being blindsided by their emotional rollercoaster	And here we are right back in romcomsville.	It's timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies, but Drew Barrymore and Justin Long's screen chemistry doesn't make up for Going the Distance's overall flatness.
As Knowing gets increasingly preposterous, and Cage's stony deadpan acting seems even sillier in context, a kind of slack-jawed joy may overtake you. How on earth did this movie get made?	A big creepy sci-fi thriller -- or two-thirds of one, anyway.	There's no time for romance, charm or comedy. The haunted characters in Knowing compete for the best graveyard looks.	Stylishly directed by Alex Proyas (who made I, Robot) this is quite simply over-the-top bonkers.	The narrative corner into which this movie, directed by Alex Proyas, paints itself is a simultaneously silly and morbidly depressing one.	Knowing has some interesting ideas and a couple good scenes, but it's weighted down by its absurd plot and over-seriousness.
A film potent enough to shock, but beguiling enough to intrigue.	The film melts into a duel of despair, rivalry and reconciliation that is as pure as it is painful.	An appropriately uneasy blend of graphic military drama and tender romance, Brothers pulls no punches even as its worst violence occurs offscreen.	The deficiencies of Brothers lie in its wholesale adoption of war film clichés and obvious plotting.	A poignant reminder that social issues, in the end, are personal matters.	This tense, understated drama explores the complications of individual and social ethics stemming from the repercussions of war on one man and his family.
Le Petit Lieutenant is an interesting crime thriller that has few conventional thrills but does give a fascinating look into the mechanics of a Parisian homicide squad.	Gives the audience a strong sense that you're watching how things really go down in a police station... only without all the action and excitement of a TV cop show.	The tough, satisfying French film Le Petit Lieutenant is an austere drama of the sort that rarely makes it to American screens except on cable television.	The movie's realism is unimpeachable, though American cops might be stunned by the idea of a half-dozen detectives being assigned to the murder of an anonymous floater.	Still mourning the end of Helen Mirren in TV's Prime Suspect? You might want to give Le Petit Lieutenant a whirl.	A gritty, languidly paced crime drama that blends old-fashioned ambiance with modern cynicism.
Just when you thought it was safe to ridicule everything Star Wars, Lucas returns from his flirtation with the Dark Side by crafting a terrific caper to his monumental series.	Revenge Of The Sith is brilliant. It's as if it took Lucas two goes to get comfortable in the director's chair and can now actually apply a bit of style to the proceedings.	There's some sadness knowing that the Star Wars pictures are done. However, I get intense pleasure knowing that the series concludes on the highest of high notes.	It may well be the best of all six Star Wars movies.	Almost exactly what it needs to be, a powerful middle film to end one trilogy and presage another.	This sixth and final installment of George Lucas' epic space opera will please die-hard fanatics and non-believers alike -- largely due to awesome digital effects and the sheer power of the mythology.
It's as warm as a double shot of Ouzo, as exotic as chicken-lemon soup and as sweet as a plate of honey-dripped baklava.	It's greek to me.	It's funny, it's familiar and you can see a lot of the situations transferring over to your own life.	Warm, familiar, not a sharp edge in sight, this movie is built to please.	(An) ugly duckling fairytale that is predictable and brimming with clichés - but so earnest, funny and joyful that it's a complete delight all the same.	Though it sometimes feels like a television sitcom, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is good-hearted, lovable, and delightfully eccentric, with a sharp script and lead performance from Nia Vardalos.
There are jokes for both young and old, it really is educational, and if you don't smile every time Mr Peabody's little tail starts wagging, then... well, there's no hope for you as a human being.	It's a headspinningly wacky premise, and it takes a little while for the audience to get up to speed, but once this is achieved, there's an awful lot of unexpected fun to be had, boasting zany adventures with various historical figures.	The film's animation design is strictly generic in its rounded edges and dutiful 3-D IN YOUR FACE!!! gimmicks. And the story gets off to such a sour start, it takes a long time for the comedy to recover.	The father-son emotional arc is a clunky and strained framework to the zippy entertainment, but like historical accuracy, it's very easy to ignore.	Mr. Peabody & Sherman front-loads the duo's adventures with one-dimensional, lowest-common-denominator conflicts as the canine genius and his preteen companion zigzag through antiquity with a comedian's, rather than a historian's, eye for detail.	Mr. Peabody & Sherman offers a surprisingly entertaining burst of colorful all-ages fun, despite its dated source material and rather convoluted plot.
The movie is more successful at creating tension than in building credible characters.	At some point, the movie itself crosses the line, from a modestly thoughtful attempt to extrapolate a drama from real and urgent events to a generic action piece with predictable good and bad guys and pat, civics-book morals.	A stimulating, challenging film.	Any movie about terrorist bombings that contains relatively few explosions, as The Siege does, deserves a special award for its lack of pyrotechnic overkill.	Not dramatic enough to deserve merit, not suspenseful enough to attract an action-oriented audience, and so preachy as to be almost ludicrous.	An exciting, well-paced action film.
Charlie's Angels is utterly good-hearted, mildly naughty fun that moves along at a cracking pace to the tune of a trendy pop score.	Blood, vengeance and comedy don't make for a smooth mix in this attempt.	Charlie's Angels is something rare: a mess of a movie that is somehow infectious, and infectious not despite the mess, but because of it.	These girls are fun and engaging and witty and sometimes that's enough, and in Charlie's Angels, where the elements come together so well, it will at least permit you a superficial, brainless, but absurdly enjoyable time.	For a movie that gets its inspiration from one of the cheesiest television shows of the extra-cheesy 1970s, Charlie's Angels is surprisingly cool.	Mixing tongue-in-cheek cheesecake with glossy action set pieces, Charlie's Angels is slick and resonably fun despite its lack of originality.
A delightfully astute and compassionate delve into the life of a 58 year-old divorcee looking for company, romance and perhaps even love.	Hitchcock once said that other directors made slices of life; he made pieces of cake. Lelio's feat is that he's made a slice of life that's a piece of cake, too.	A raw and rich look at loneliness, love and aging.	Gloria's journey is free from artificial flashpoints or climaxes.	Dominated by the sexual complexity of the indomitable title character, it's intriguing and should be particularly appealing to a middle-aged, female audience.	Marvelously directed by Sebastian Lelio and beautifully led by a powerful performance from Paulina Garcia, Gloria takes an honest, sweetly poignant look at a type of character that's all too often neglected in Hollywood.
Writer-director Lurie makes dramas that whole-headedly engage ethical quandaries yet dodge easy judgments.	Should find favor with audiences eager for movies driven by characterization, ideas and the performances of actors whose screen presence offers as much justification for the existence of cinema as any camera trick, flashy montage or special effect.	Rod Lurie's crisp take on the Valerie Plame case-with Vera Farmiga standing in for Plame and Kate Beckinsale for Judith Miller-is admirably bluster-free but suffers at times from movie-of-the-week syndrome.	Nothing But the Truth is jaw-droppingly over-the-top in ways that are all good for a laugh, but don't amount to much in the way of serious critique.	Lurie balances the tragic repercussions of two women drawn into a swirling riptide of political neglect, judicial irresponsibility, and sudden violence.	A well-crafted political thriller, Nothing But the Truth features a strong cast that helps the real-life drama make an effortless transition to the big screen.
In her latest film, Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg, [director Aviva] Kempner once again educates and entertains with unexpected tidbits and just plain good old-fashioned filmmaking.	An engaging, straightforward documentary on Gertrude Berg (1898-1966).	Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg does an exemplary job of celebrating the seminal achievements of Gertrude Berg and reaffirming her status as a broadcasting pioneer.	This was a very informative documentary that is told with a subtle passion. I found it very warm and welcoming. If you have interest in entertainment history, this is a must see!	Kempner creates a poignant reminder of one of the most influential, if now largely forgotten, great ladies of entertainment.	Equal parts edification and entertainment, Kempner's tender tribute to a forgotten pioneer of American entertainment is both richly deserved and long overdue.
It's entertaining as far as it goes, a highly watchable portrait of one of America's most distinctive communication tools.	When all is said and done, Art & Copy is little more than an ad for advertising.	It all sounds rather grandiose, but it's hardly a surprising view from folks accustomed to thinking big.	The joy that these creative types experience when their work is successful and the seriousness with which they approach their craft comes shining through. Along the way, viewers get caught up in their exuberance.	A deeply fascinating movie ... you'll probably never be able to look at commercials and ads the same way again.	Art & Copy doesn't probe deeply enough, or think critically enough about its subject.
Akin to an unhealthy relationship, this self-described 'anti-romantic comedy' begins hot and heavy before buckling beneath the weight of pointless conflicts and ridiculous game-playing.	The Break-Up can't work because it denies its protagonist his humanity, and us the pleasure of watching human characters do at least vaguely human things.	Stereotypes across the board, puerile one-upmanship games, and an utter failure to explain why, indeed, these two even were together.	An eye for the devil in the details gives the story its heart -- a broken heart, but that's better than none at all.	In spite of some laughs, and winning performances from Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, The Break-Up is more likely to make audiences squirm than cheer.	This anti-romantic comedy lacks both laughs and insight, resulting in an odd and unsatisfying experience.
This hip blend of Sherlock Holmes and Howard Hughes is an offbeat suspense comedy.	An intriguing character study of its protagonist disguised as a conventional comic mystery.	The wryly intelligent, creative script serves the story, the characters and the actors well, never disappointing in ingenuity or opportunities for uncanny comic timing.	A charmingly off-center little film with intriguing plot twists and engaging characters.	A nifty psychological thriller that puts a few new twists on the well worn detective genre.	A promising debut for writer/director Jake Kasdan, Zero Effect overcomes its flaws with its off-kilter humor and likeable leads.
...hardly important but well-made and ultimately life-affirming	Sheerly as film, Primary Colors generally sizzles.	The film owes a few doggie bones to "Wag the Dog," which came first in pointing out what Primary Colors only seconds.	an alarmingly topical comedy-drama that dredges up far more issues than it can address in its two-and-a-half hours. But give Nichols, writer Elaine May and everyone else an 'A' for effort.	Director Mike Nichols never allows Primary Colors to get bogged down in a moralistic morass.	Well acted and suprisingly funny.
Disappointing Muppet movie. Too much Treasure Island, not enough Muppets.	Geena Davis and Renny Harlin couldn't cut it with Cutthroat Island. Steven Spielberg nearly got the hook for Hook. But leave it to Miss Piggy and Kermit to discover uncharted gold in the shipwrecked-pirate genre.	The humor is up to Muppet par, with physical comedy, puns, running jokes, and layered gags...Muppet Treasure Island is grand family entertainment. [new DVD review]	The Muppets hit the high seas. Hilarious!	Lively, enjoyable Muppet madness	Though less Muppet-centric than the original trilogy, Muppet Treasure Island is an energetic, cheerful take on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure, with typically solid gags.
Anyone walking into Tropic Thunder looking to be offended by Downey's minstrel turn will soon find that the movie is two steps ahead.	Coarse, crude, merciless and often very funny.	... director Ben Stiller gleefully severs the hand that feeds him in his vicious, funny Hollywood satire.	Is this a comedy -- or a cry for help?	With so much extreme mayhem going on, keeping the comedy cooking at top levels is a daunting task Stiller pulls off with aplomb.	With biting satire, plenty of subversive humor, and an unforgettable turn by Robert Downey, Jr., Tropic Thunder is a triumphant late Summer comedy.
A brilliant, bromantic blockbuster.	A blaze of thrilling sci-fi adventure, stunning special effects and - most importantly - further subtle development of a series of characters who are familiar and yet fresh at the same time.	A popcorn sci-fi movie.	Star Trek Into Darkness may not go boldly back to the archives, but it serves up an exhilarating spectacle, with noteworthy moments of intimacy.	Much like Kirk and his crew, Abrams and his team still manage to get the job done despite the criticisms that they've drifted from the Enterprise's original mission.	Visually spectacular and suitably action packed, Star Trek Into Darkness is a rock-solid installment in the venerable sci-fi franchise, even if it's not as fresh as its predecessor.
What's most remarkable about it is the way Bong builds real suspense and plays the chilling moments straight while leaving himself room for nonsense and horseplay.	Uneven movie has tonal problems.	Memories of Murder offers a ruminative and affecting approach to a genre not known for its emotional content.	Joon-ho Bong lets viewers fall into the cops' frustrations, but these detectives are dogged, not downtrodden. "Memories" shows their lives, however tortured, outside the case - like "Heat" without antagonistic rivalries or a more political "Zodiac."	straightforward, with minimal flourish	Memories of Murder blends the familiar crime genre with social satire and comedy, capturing the all-too human desperation of its key characters.
It's a story of courage, idealism, ego and corporate cowardice.	Earnest, smart, handsome, well-acted and made with mastery.	A seat-gripping near-thriller.	The best movie about the complexities, challenges and moral conflicts of news reporting since All the President's Men.	A deeply riveting media thriller.	Intelligent, compelling, and packed with strong performances, The Insider is a potent corporate thriller.
If Jackson had focused simply on Bilbo's party and their attempts to get a proper homeland for the dwarves, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' would have been a leaner, more engaging tale.	Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth feels familiar and unfulfilling.	A wild and visually stunning quest through a fantasy world all done with the noble spirit of courage and goodwill.	...a jaw-dropping visual carnival courtesy of Peter Jackson and company!	An Unexpected Journey offers an unparalleled visual spectacle	Peter Jackson's return to Middle-earth is an earnest, visually resplendent trip, but the film's deliberate pace robs the material of some of its majesty.
Every shot, cut, line, performance, indeed every moment in this feature is perfectly judged, always conveying precisely what it needs to convey in to define its characters and move the story forward.	It may puzzle audiences unfamiliar with the Israeli system but the rigid religious bureaucracy devoted to keeping a married couple together at all cost makes for a superb way of adding layers of tension to this effective drama.	The Trial of Viviane Amsalem has a script full of sharp wordplay, with just the perfect amount of expressive silent moments. [full review in Spanish]	Almost all of the film takes place inside a courtroom, at irregular intervals over five years, but there is no sense of drag or slump; on the contrary, the action quivers with tension, impatience, comic heat, and, beneath it all, an irrepressible rage.	The set-up can seem frustratingly constrictive and redundant, but that's the point. The film is no more exasperating than the rigid, patriarchal legal system it depicts.	On paper, GETT: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem might seem less than thrilling, but on the screen, it delivers two hours of nonstop, tightly wound, brilliantly acted drama.
an ambitious effort, the chronicling of an era through a musical niche, but its scope and structure plunge story and character elements deep in the mix.	Eden is the kind of movie that hits you when you least expect it. Just when I thought it was a mess, its aimlessness began to make complete sense.	If the result feels anesthetized, that could be seen as a tribute to the music, which remains ecstatically dull; when you are lost in it, the movie implies, the rest of life -- and even time itself -- can pass you by.	Eden tackles one of fiction's oldest themes - the awkward transition from youthful idealism to wised-up, resigned adulthood - and finds rich new terrain to explore.	Eden offers a wise assessment of the interplay between fantasy and reality on the path to adulthood. The seductive rhythms are a perfect match for a movie that analyzes the unstoppable flow of life.	Eden uses 1990s club culture as the appropriately intoxicating backdrop for a sensitive, low-key look at aging and the price of pursuing one's dreams.
A wonderfully literary, wordy, and wise film.	The unique duplication of stage cast to screen cast might be the most exciting thing about this conventional classroom exercise.	It's been quite a while since movies have offered such a nice night out at the theater.	A funny thing happened to The History Boys on the way to the screen. The players are the same, the dialogue is pretty much identical, but the vibrancy of the play -- its exhilarating immediacy -- has been muted.	Movies, unlike plays, tend to be just about a very few things, or they feel rushed and overly sweeping, as this one occasionally did. Plays can linger and chew on their themes and keep the audience engaged much more easily.	While not quite having the impact of its original stage version, The History Boys nevertheless is a witty and involving school drama.
If you go to see it, hang in there and you will be rewarded with something special.	Looking for Richard will undoubtedly live forever in English Lit classes, but in the classroom it won't captivate quite the way it does on the big screen.	Almost inadvertently Pacino comes up with what must be one of the best films of his career.	succeeds in giving us a greater appreciation for Shakespeare	Kids seeing this film first may well end up with a better understanding of the Bard's work.	Looking for Richard a smart, fascinating behind-the-scenes look at adapting Shakespeare.
The movie is unusually sensitive to the ways young people pick up their cues on how to act like adults, and how awkwardly they practice what they've learned.	The kind of thriller that Ken Loach might make in collaboration with Michael Haneke, a slice of social-realist cinema in which we are never sure what - if anything - is about happen. It's oppressively pessimistic but also utterly gripping.	An emotionally devastating, well-shop and captivating coming-of-age drama boasting a brave and raw performance by the radiant Katie Jarvis.	Instead of shutting down the film's meaning, the sex scenes open it up -- a gambit that will no doubt offend some viewers with its unsentimental candor.	Plenty of films have presented us with the Angry Young Man but not so many with the Angry Young Woman ...Andrea Arnold does her bit to help correct this imbalance with Fish Tank...	Cannes Jury Prize-winner Fish Tank is gritty British realism at its very best, with flawless performances from newcomer Kate Jarvis, and Michael Fassbender.
Somehow it never gets old.	Fun, funny movie. Jack Palance is great.	Harmless fluff, but nothing exciting.	Simplistic look at mid-life male wackiness, but the cast saves it with little effort.	A comedy that was and is ambitious and counterintuitive.	With a supremely talented cast and just enough midlife drama to add weight to its wildly silly overtones, City Slickers uses universal themes to earn big laughs.
The wartime subject matter may seem familiar at first, but Holland's Oscar contender exerts a powerful grip.	Koolhoven's philosophical probing of human limitation among the good guys is all but overwhelmed by his commercial instincts and undeniable skill at juggling realism with genre.	Young Lakemeier's performance is poignant without ever falling into sentimentality.	Melodramatic and predictable, Winter in Wartime wants to be tough but settles for compellingly familiar.	Koolhoven is able to strip away both visually and mentally our idealized cinematic notions of how the resistance fighters lived. It's a lonely existence. It's stark and it's scary. And it makes for a compelling movie.	A gripping, handsomely shot World War II melodrama with thriller elements successfully mixed in.
The Pope's Toilet cloaks religious critique in the scrappy tempo of irremediable poverty and irrepressible enterprise.	Watch it now, and you'll be surprised how such a little movie can cut so deeply to the bone.	It's charming in a proper way, entirely avoiding sentiment and can be counted one of the best films in town.	This is a heartfelt and deadpan portrait of the knife-edge poverty of people who are not so much greedy as desperate.	Despite the sensationalism of Holy Father's arrival, the subtext here is that there's a speck on the map whose poor are treated as well as a backed-up john.	An offbeat charmer, The Pope's Toilet is a humorous, well-crafted tale with plenty of heart and a poignant social message.
Bow Wow makes an impressive film debut; parents and children will love Calv's plucky can-do attitude; and the action sequences are given a little more oomph due to the presence of real life basketball pros.	Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle.	A movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship Lil' Bow Wow.	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster, Anne Meara, Eugene Levy, and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie.	A ho-hum effort populated by a far more engaging cast than it deserves.	A pleasant and innocuous diversion for kids, but adults may have trouble sitting through the movie's predictable plotlines and schmaltz.
The first Tunisian film I have ever seen, and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I'm likely to see all year.	Belly dancing isn't always the most thrilling of dances, but it's a blast to see these women shaking and rolling because they're so thoroughly in charge of the male clientele and their own sexuality.	This bold and lyrical first feature from Raja Amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment.	The movie rides on Ms. Abbass's serenely confident performance.	Lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous, but Abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth.	Abbass shines at the center of this sensuous and vibrant film.
Should they go back and make yet another Crow film, I suggest that they consider adding some originality.	While Salvation certainly isn't as bad as that first sequel, it still doesn't come near the sheer coolness of the first one.	Near on par with the original...A real surprise package	A pleasingly low-budget demeanor.	Plenty of bad dialogue, zero originality or depth.	The Crow: Salvation adds nothing new to the series and is plagued by bad acting and dialogue.
Keep on Trekkin' ... The Star Trek TV series boldly went where none of its movie versions have gone before or since in Meyer's exceedingly space-worthy sequel.	This is one of the most popular in the series, thanks to a high action quotient (including a tensely staged space battle), a suitably campy turn by Montalban, and the shock value of Spock's 'death.'	probably the best-ever trek movie	Arguably the best of the Star Trek movies.	Has everything you could ask for in a good sci‑fi action-adventure: well-drawn heroes, a terrific villain, exciting outer-space showdowns… and a touch of reflective depth.	Considered by many fans to be the best of the Star Trek movies, Khan features a strong plot, increased tension, and a sharp supporting performance from Ricardo Montalban.
...yet another brainless and boisterous formula that's sure to make one's hair curl on their arms. Bad Boys II is a vacuous vehicle that struts its stuff without any convincing ounce of concrete involvement whatsoever.	Longer, louder, stupider and more vulgar than 1995's Bad Boys.	Bad Boys 2" is exactly what a summer sequel should be - bigger, better and badder than the original.	A simple cop buddy movie extended to unconscionable length in order to accommodate redundant action scenes, endless banter between stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith and several potential endings, this production suffers from serious overkill.	The most visually and aurally offensive film since Mariah Carey's Glitter.	Two and a half hours of explosions and witless banter.
There's no farce quite as farcical as a British farce.	Coogan's greatest creation is at his petty, venal and self-serving worst in this hilarious if not-the-most-original comedy.	Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, in which the comic actor Steve Coogan returns to his most enduring creation, a peevish and pettyminded Norfolk DJ, demonstrates that the transfer need not result in a thinning-out or compromise.	It's Coogan's brassy performance that makes this English comedy rock.	A hilarious addition to the ever-expanding canvas of the versatile Norwich DJ, Alpha Papa provides solid proof that the bouncebackability of Alan Partridge knows no bounds. Lovely stuff.	The Alan Partridge movie ditches the TV series' nuanced humor for something broader, and succeeds in presenting the character on a global scale.
Dated and a little silly now, but one must love Ray Francois and Julie in a common mix.	While not one of Truffaut's strongest film, it is nonetheless one of his few explicitly political works and also boasts sharp imagery by Roeg) and indelible score by Herrmann.	...celebrates the romance of the written word while also reveling in the medium that has replaced reading for many people, the cinema...	This is the kind of film that should encourage the perceptive viewer to rush out to the library to read someone like Herman Melville before it's too late.	Weird, yes. And wonderful.	Fahrenheit 451 is an intriguing film that suffuses Truffaut's trademark wit and black humor with the intelligence and morality of Ray Bradbury's novel.
A film that's laugh-out-loud funny, occasionally touching and often borders on coherent -- a rarity for Gilliam, even when he's on top form...	a confusing mess. ... a promising set-up assembled with bits and pieces of Gilliam's brilliance, but he clearly did not wake up in the middle of the night with a brilliant vision	On one level this is a typically chaotic and rather overdone fantasy from Terry Gilliam, but on another it's an immensely touching film because it contains Heath Ledger's last screen appearance.	Seriously, if you could make money designing other people's acid trips, Gilliam would be a zillionaire.	Doctor Parnassus is sometimes exhilarating, sometimes merely deranged -- but since excess and fragmentation are Gilliam's trademarks, his virtues are impossible to separate from his vices.	Terry Gilliam remains as indulgent as ever, but The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus represents a return to the intoxicatingly imaginative, darkly beautiful power of his earlier work, with fine performances to match all the visual spectacle.
...a repellent, nauseating, disgusting motion picture.	It doesn't really have anything on its mind at all, except finding creative ways to photograph arterial blood spraying from someone's neck.	This violent sci-fi retread is exactly what it sounds like: a film shoddily assembled from the vital parts of other, far superior films.	Sapochnik, Law, Whitaker, and Schreiber have so much fun with all the extremes, wallowing in their shameless excess with the right dollop of macabre, self-aware humor.	Cliches abound: frantically edited fights, gore, lethargically acted	Repo Men has an intriguing premise, as well as a likable pair of leads, but they're wasted on a rote screenplay, indifferent direction, and mind-numbing gore.
Meticulously constructed, beautifully played and poignant.	A classic humanist tale without becoming mawkish.	Best known for his samurai warriors and sweeping landscapes, Kurosawa paints this intimate film with black and white scenes that relate to everyone	Few actors besides Shimura, could pull off the older, round-shouldered protagonist's downcast face, later "unnatural" and scary to a young woman.	Kurosawa has created a subtle and moving account of a man who searches for meaning in the final days of his shallow existence.	Ikiru is a well-acted and deeply moving humanist tale about a man facing his own mortality, one of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most intimate films.
Schrader's film is a notch better than Harlin's (it's elegantly framed, and stately where the other one was music-video pushy), but when you boil out the demon feathers...it's the same damn movie.	One instance of a CGI overlay looks as if the VFX crew added hand-drawn temp animation and then forgot to go back for a final polish.	Marred by some of the same problems as Harlin's version -- namely, weak supporting characters, unintentionally funny dialogue and poorly executed special effects.	Ambitious, serious-minded horror opus.	Dominion is only incrementally better than Exorcist: The Beginning and, with both films sharing so many story elements, Harlin is guilty of merely rearranging the deck chairs on Schrader's Titanic.	While director Schrader's attempt at a literate, internal exposition on evil temptations and human sin is admirable, this prequel suffers from hit-and-miss psychological tension, poor visual effects, and weak writing -- an overambitious failure of a horror movie.
The movie's cinematography, set design, and costume design are all extremely elegant, and the beautiful young actors are shown off to maximum effect, like expensively bred horses.	A clever reworking of a literary classic.	Deliciously cunning.	Cruel Intentions takes the incredible brilliance of de Laclos's 1782 novel and makes it...a teeny bit dull.	This is the filmic answer to a pack of Spice Girl cards.	Even in a slick package and an attractive cast, the movie succumbs to bad acting and a bad script.
Be prepared to collapse into a hoot and a howl of hilarity at all the wrong moments.	A fascinating, colourful, sometimes outrageous film that succeeds because it was built on a solid foundation.	If nothing else, Brewer has come up with the perfect solution for dealing with the dozens of out-of-control teen actresses in the world.	Humid and overwrought, with Ricci working at fever pitch and Jackson bringing fire, brimstone and some passable blues licks to the equation, Black Snake Moan is no polite little indie thing, and certainly no formulaic studio exercise.	Do they give awards based on balls-out craziness? They should. This one would sweep that ceremony.	Uninhibited performances, skillful direction, and a killer blues soundtrack elevate Black Snake Moan beyond its outlandish premise.
One of those films that look good as a trailer, but the house of cards soon falls flat when the idea has to be sustained for 90 minutes.	O espetáculo final compensa.	Far too bland and mediocre to really pull off such heavy handed themes...	At an unsustainable 134 minutes, it's at least 20 minutes longer than it deserves to be.	A hell of a lot more fun than any film bearing John Grisham's name.	Though it is ultimately somewhat undone by its own lofty ambitions, The Devil's Advocate is a mostly effective blend of supernatural thrills and character exploration.
Hepburn is clearly awkward as the Cockney Eliza in the first half, and in general the adaptation is a little too reverential to really come alive.	Despite all reservations expressed, I must make clear that his fantastically successful show has been converted into a generally entertaining film.	Perhaps the best recommendation about this movie is that it transcends its conventions and almost anyone, not just fans of musicals or romances or classics, may find it entertaining.	A marvelous restoration of the 30-year-old musical, precisely the kind of high-class popular entertainment that Hollywood can't seem to make these days.	Literate, funny, brilliantly cast, with a score of Lerner and Loewe songs that does not include one dud.	Fans of the play may miss Julie Andrews in the starring role -- particularly when Marni Nixon's singing comes out of Audrey Hepburn's mouth -- but the film's charm is undeniable.
People who go to see Jurassic Park III are not there for character development, they want cool-looking dinosaurs, and that they will get in spades.	If you're looking for a tight script, interesting three-dimensional characters and something new with this movie, you will be disappointed.	It's not art ... it's entertainment, and it knows it. Boy, does it entertain.	A marked improvement over its immediate predecessor, this film works as a fast and efficient thriller that offers a few great surprises along the way.	Much darker than the previous films, this third installment feels more like a horror flick set in amusement park than a good sci-fi adventure, though special effects, due to technology advances, are more sophisticated.	Jurassic Park III is darker and faster than its predecessors, but that doesn't quite compensate for the franchise's continuing creative decline.
Not recommended.	Please make a reservation on the Oscar watch list for Don Cheadle for his four-star triumph in Hotel Rwanda.	This is a story too big to even begin to comprehend, much less turn into a movie; still, by keeping the focus small, the filmmakers manage big impact.	Oscar-nominated, Cheadle and Okonedo are the film's impressive heart. Despite the madness around them, both are never less than believable.	Rusesabagina remains a vivid, remarkable character, and the screenplay crafts a hero without hero-mongering or phony tributeering.	A sobering and heartfelt tale about massacre that took place in Rwanda while most of the world looked away.
Combining vivid characters with a fresh story, this is one of Pixar's best films yet.	Rarely do Pixar films fall short of excellence, and Ratatouille is no exception.	Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible.	Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too.	Easily the best Pixar film since A Bug's Life, Ratatouille is deliciously delightful, wonderfully sweet and drop-dead gorgeous.	Fast-paced and stunningly animated, Ratatouille adds another delightfully entertaining entry -- and a rather unlikely hero -- to the Pixar canon.
Song Of The Sea is a triumph of design and animation.	The picture is beautifully rendered in pencils and watercolors, with some CG, giving it an appropriately timeless storybook look, even though it's set in a mostly modern world of buses and 3-D glasses.	A film about terrible things that ensue when overprotective love separates a child from her heritage and represses the natural expression of grief.	This beautifully animated Irish fable has a grace and emotional resonance ...	Like Miyazaki, Moore may trade in fantasy and myth, but his movies speak in sweeping truths that track straight to the heart of the kid in everyone.	Song of the Sea boasts narrative depth commensurate with its visual beauty, adding up to an animated saga overflowing with family-friendly riches.
Despite major trimmings of Shakespeare's text, this is a lovely version of the much-filmed play, largely due to the casting of the leads with handsome, unknown teenagers.	Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet is a lovely, sensitive, friendly popularization of the play...	The best screen adaptation of Shakespeare's wonderful romance.	A world of sundrenched piazzas, masked balls, rowdy swordsmanship, bustling marketplaces, moonlight, meadows, and passion	Mostly it remains enjoyable for its color and visual flair.	The solid leads and arresting visuals make a case for Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet as the definitive cinematic adaptation of the play.
Ridley Scott shows a lighter touch this time in outer space as Matt Damon proves there is life on Mars and in this gem of a sci-fi adventure.	In The Martian, Ridley Scott dwells into the psyche and sanity of man when survival is at its most urgent. [Full review in Spanish]	Ridley Scott's not made his third sci-fi masterpiece, but boy, has he come close.	Anchored by another great turn from Matt Damon, The Martian mixes smarts, laughs, weird character bits and tension on a huge canvas. The result is Scott's most purely enjoyable film for ages.	This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences and, as such, a fulfilling and satisfying experience.	Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny, The Martian offers a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott.
A forgotten gem.	It's a great movie.	One of Brian De Palma's best pictures.	The final moments of Blow Out are among the most shocking and powerful of De Palma's oeuvre, tacking a final note of irony onto a story that is in every other way a straightforward denunciation of power run amok.	With attractive leads and a stylish flair for suspense, De Palma misses sustaining involvement by his distracting allusions to prior films.	With a story inspired by Antonioni's Blow Up and a style informed by the high-gloss suspense of Hitchcock, DePalma's Blow Out is raw, politically informed, and littered with film references.
More reminiscent of common ketchup than Kate's magnificent saffron sauce, No Reservations is likeable, peopled by appealing characters, and entirely unremarkable.	The salacious close-ups of saucepans and gnocchi and quail guarantee it: After seeing No Reservations you'll be hungry for a really top-flight meal. And, to go with it, a better film.	No Reservations is a factory-sealed romantic comedy. But the emotional details of its characters' journeys are surprising, honest and life-size.	This take it or leave it romantic comedy probably wouldn't get many Michelin stars, but it's not the turkey twizzler you might expect.	Remaking a movie doesn't always work, but in this case it's like really good leftovers... add a fresh spice or two and it's almost as good the second time around.	This romantic comedy may look good on paper, but it's too predictable and melancholy for the genre.
Turistas has mastered the international language: stupidity.	If the filmmakers were trying to scare American kids into cultural isolationism, this would be a pretty good piece of propaganda for the cause.	As conflicted as the U.S. psyche: The movie locates the ghastly fates of its victims in the history of American arrogance, yet tells us to never trust a foreigner, even when she's in a bikini.	If you remove all the horror aspects of it, it works nicely as a tourism campaign for Brazil. Never has there been a dumber group of travelers; wait to rent it.	more sick than scary, more revolting than revealing, more twisted than tantalizing.	Beautiful scenery and cinematography can't save Turistas from its wooden acting and stale and predictable plot.
Heavy on style and atmosphere and light on virtually everything else.	Does earn its place amongst the list of films that understand what gambling is and how the downs of it may just be the up.	Critics are likely to interpret Pacino's work as intentional self-parody, because he's smart enough to know that he's played this kind of unhinged father figure too many times	As any real gambler knows, when you start losing, it's best to cut and run.	A hatefully cynical and unsympathetic look at gambling addiction.	Despite its sportsmanlike swagger, Two for the Money's aimless plot isn't worth betting on.
The stars sell the cutesiness, and the rawness-equals-real go-nowhereness that seemingly infects every conversation in a microbudget indie, with equal professionalism and vigor; if they can't stick the landing in the end, it's because no one could.	A deliberative, slow-moving, but still very winning comedy/drama, driven by a couple of very strong performances.	Funny, nuanced, relatable, touching, and an absolute pleasure to watch.	We laugh with these people not because they're absurd, but because they're so normal. Swanberg's made the rare film that feels exactly the way your friends do when they don't know you're watching them.	That Olivia Wilde can sure hold her liquor, and look cute doing it.	Smart, funny, and powered by fine performances from Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson, Drinking Buddies offers a bittersweet slice of observational comedy.
Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is pure B-movie bliss.	The Kill Bill films leave me cold. For all their technical interest, the films still feel like an arrogant "aren't I clever and neato?" showboating move.	Simply one of the best films, period.	Those turned off by the first part's reckless, relentless violent purges aren't likely to find cause for conversion, but Vol. 2 certainly broadens the tale's remit, even as it aims to deepen it.	If Kill Bill Vol. 1 was bloody exhilarating, Vol. 2 is bloody great. And, as a bonus, not nearly so bloody.	Talkier and less action-packed than Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2, nevertheless delivers the goods for those expecting a satisfying conclusion to this two-parter.
It's sad to see the comedian straining to stay afloat in this moat of unfunniness.	Black Knight is a movie that knows its audience. Its underlying philosophy might be: why try harder when this is all they expect?	You don't need the powers of Merlin to see nearly every plot development and every joke from miles away.	Particularly uninspired, a series of gags strung together without much care for order or context.	Lawrence relies on his usual act as the hip black guy surrounded by square white men.	Black Knight feels like a lazily constructed movie, filled with lame gags and constant mugging from Lawrence.
...a lovely, languorous film that does much with little and leaves you feeling like you've witnessed some minor miracle.	Viewers willing to slow down their cinematic metabolism enough to watch The Exploding Girl at its own pace will find their patience rewarded by moments of great beauty...	Restless audiences may itch for more plot, for the kind of fiery dramatics that typify young love in the movies, but hold the explosives: There's tender drama, too, in the possibilities of a hand-hold.	It's a rare and wonderful thing to see a movie so attuned to the rhythms of daily life, to the ways a trauma builds and expands over time.	A Zen-like experience of watchful compassion in deliberately challenging circumstances: trying to see and hear, without leaping to conclusions, the gathering troubles of a young woman living in hectic circles and with increasing self-absorption.	Its languid pace and willfully understated narrative may test the patience of some viewers, but Bradley Rust Gray's gentle direction and a gripping performance from Zoe Kazan lend The Exploding Girl an appealing, melancholy beauty.
As rich, fulfilling and complex as a traditional Indian meal.	It is a saga told in small pieces, a patchwork of short scenes that tumble after each other almost apologetically, as if they would love to linger a little longer, but there is too much to tell and only so much time in which to do it.	It's so beautifully done.	This is a wonderful movie.	It's an oft-told story of tolerance and assimilation, of no particular interest in itself, but Nair has such a cinematic eye that her films are always a visual feast. She does not disappoint here.	An ambitious exploration of the immigrant experience with a talented cast that serves the material well.
You could dog-ear the pages of every thesaurus imaginable, though, and still not be able to capture the visceral power that Gibson presents. You just have to see it.	No matter what your interest is in the film -- entertainment or information -- Apocalypto delivers the goods, and then some.	Offers non-stop excitement and we MEAN non-stop, an electrifying epic in every sense of the word.	Whatever Gibson's flaws as a man -- and the public has every right to judge him by his actions -- he is no fraud as a filmmaker.	By the end I felt sure it was the most obsessively, graphically violent film I'd ever seen, but equally sure that Apocalypto is a visionary work with its own wild integrity. And absolutely, positively convinced that seeing it once is enough.	Apocalypto is a brilliantly filmed, if mercilessly bloody, examination of a once great civilization.
John le Carré's 1974 novel - most famously served in the BBC's seven-part series with Alec Guinness in the Smiley role - is machine-tooled down to a lean two hours by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson.	It's a treat to be back in Le Carré's world, where amid the tangle of plots and counterplots there are moments of lucidity when you sit up and say, "I've got it now!"	unfolds with maximum perplexity, ensuring that we will never, despite being able to grasp the stakes and gravity of individual scenes, be sure exactly what is going on.	From watching the film, it ends up feeling like maybe reading the book should be a prerequisite, or perhaps viewing the five-hour miniseries would be a good idea.	Completely absorbing and a more than worthy companion piece to the 1979 BBC serialisation.	Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a dense puzzle of anxiety, paranoia, and espionage that director Tomas Alfredson pieces together with utmost skill.
Makes fine use of Paris as its backdrop, and the performances are all of the highest order.	Rivette manages the complex choreography of his characters with virtuoso comic timing.	The sort of lighter-than-air cinematic souffle that only the French seem capable of making nowadays.	There are a number of fantastic scenes in Va Savoir, but the realities of its characters and their portrayals -- some no doubt a function of a different culture, others undercooked in any language -- undermine its effectiveness.	Va Savoir is a relatively labored offering from Nouvelle Vague auteur Jacques Rivette.	Constructed with grace and wit, Va Savoir is a light-hearted yet cerebral romantic comedy of intertwining relations.
Funny back-to-the-future adventure spiced with a save-the-whales theme.	The most successful and widely appealing of the Star Trek films, The Voyage Home is also the most idiosyncratic some of the most humorous and humane moments in the Trek canon.	Mr. Nimoy directed this Star Trek installment, and indeed he should probably direct all of them. His technical expertise leaves much to be desired. But his sincerity is unmistakable, and it counts for a lot.	I suspect the unconverted will want to be beamed up pronto.	A happy, heartfelt chapter that reunites the original cast with the original TV format, shying away from the cold and epic scale of the preceding movie adventures.	Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is perhaps the lightest and most purely enjoyable entry of the long-running series, emphasizing the eccentricities of the Enterprise's crew.
Director Francis Ford Coppola makes a good effort, but his interesting character-based approach eventually dissolves into yet another uninspired courtroom drama.	Damon and Danes are fabulous together, and even more than the surprisingly complex story and nice cameos and deft and economical direction by Francis Ford Coppola, they are what makes The Rainmaker worth seeing.	A surprisingly entertaining and compelling courtroom drama that finds its real strength outside the court.	Francis Ford Coppola, who wrote and directed the film, has made the most of Grisham's ground-level realism.	Celebrates the zeal for justice espoused by a rookie Memphis lawyer.	Invigorated by its talented cast and Francis Ford Coppola's strong direction, The Rainmaker is a satisfying legal drama -- and arguably the best of Hollywood's many John Grisham adaptations.
What a shame that the remake fell into the unwieldy hands of the same jokers responsible for last year's execrable Prom Night redo.	[Nelson] McCormick has crafted a horror remake so undistinguished it makes Prom Night look like a masterpiece of transgressive filmmaking.	Horror remake has more tension than blood.	a shabby substitute for its original.	The original is notable for being a breakthrough role for Terry O'Quinn, nowadays best known as John Locke on Lost. The remake is notable for nothing whatsoever.	This tepid remake of the 1987 cult classic lacks the tension and satirical undercurrents of the original.
Comedy? Horror? Tongue-in-cheek horror? Horror-in-comedy cheek? After a couple of truly frightening moments near the beginning you can sense shoulders being shrugged.	Typical, tiresome, forgettable crap.	A slasher movie minus the slasher.	Pedestrian direction, clichd writing and bland acting all contribute to make Final Destination a flight that probably should have been cancelled.	Generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory.	Despite a panel of X-Files' alums at the helm and a promising premise, flighty performances and poor execution keep Final Destination from ever taking off.
No contemporary talking heads; none needed.	Let the Fire Burn outshines the lackluster likes of Our Nixon by combining the death-trip of a Senna with the radical history of Black Power Mixtape.	Apart from the score and the very occasional basic intertitle to help us along, all we see and hear is footage from the day. We're immersed in the present of this world.	Shocking events in Philadelphia get their day at the movies	Resurrecting into the present literally from the ashes and beneath the rubble of the dubious past, are lessons gleaned from the Philly police bombing and incineration of MOVE members. Shedding a light on a dark US history of war against its own people.	Smartly edited and heartbreakingly compelling, Let the Fire Burn uses archival footage to uncover a troubling -- and still deeply resonant -- chapter in American history.
[An] elegiac, moving drama.	Only an overstuffed middle, battle-heavy section keeps Letters From Iwo Jima from being an elite movie.	In every way possible, Letters from Iwo Jima is the superior effort and precisely the kind of film Flags of Our Fathers should have been.	What emerges most powerfully, though, is an intimate sense of sorrow, and of decency. If there is any chance that popular American cinema will continue to be an art form, then I bet Eastwood's Iwo Jima films will stand as a monumental achievement.	[Director] Eastwood [shows] how people make impossible choices with dreadful repercussions.	A powerfully humanistic portrayal of the perils of war, this companion piece to Flags of our Fathers is potent and thought-provoking, and it demonstrates Clint Eastwood's maturity as a director.
Wahlberg looks like a rising star, while the seasoned Forster manifests his usual sober authority and approachable masculinity.	Stilted, bland and two-dimensional.	An absolute gem: superb performances, clever writing, humorous and sardonic, twists galore.	It's a nice little movie about the friendship of two regular Joes, odd and affecting.	Extremely likable because it is so specific	Robert Forster's tour-de-force performance, along with Daniel M. Cohen's sensitive direction and subtly shaded screenplay, brings rare heft to this mentor/protégé buddy film.
This movie is what's known as family entertainment, which means in this case that it's interesting and harmless.	This entertaining film is so full of factual inaccuracies that are unnecessary they degrade the final product.	Think south-of-the-border Bad News Bears.	Barely dramatizing off-the-field struggles like visa problems and the boys' first taste of good ol' American racism, the film does a disservice to the community it depicts by rendering an inspiring cultural story entirely uninspired.	there is a tricky line for a film to walk between earnest sweetness and syrupy schmaltz. The Perfect Game pulls off this balancing act with a combination of smart direction and even smarter casting	It's bogged down with an unfocused script and countless sports movie cliches, but The Perfect Game still manages to charm with its unabashed sweetness and a stirring final act.
It's respectful of its predecessor, and when it does make changes to the existing template, they aren't preposterous or pandering -- rather, they merely take another logical path than the one employed in the previous version.	This tense character piece offers proof that Hollywood can still make a good, traditional Western, rather than emulating the revisionist Westerns that have followed in the wake of Clint Eastwood's 1993 Academy Award-winner Unforgiven.	A kick-ass action film, as well as a vastly entertaining movie that proves that popcorn flicks don't have to be dumb, shallow or contemporary to be enjoyed.	The studiousness, or maybe affectation, that has informed Mangold's visual style has now been applied to the reproduction of classic Western moviemaking.	Crowe is a perfect rogue showing us Wade's mean and nasty side, along with some charm and intelligence	This remake of a classic Western improves on the original, thanks to fiery performances from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale as well as sharp direction from James Mangold.
Steven Spielberg in his ruthless cat-playing-with-a-mouse mode.	The Lost World, while terrifically entertaining, is also structurally out of kilter.	Just watching dinosaurs attacking and killing stupid people is not enough.	Been there, done that. Now there's just more of it.	The fact that the movie is literally dull comes as a surprise, especially with the usually reliable Spielberg at the helm.	The Lost World demonstrates how far CG effects have come in the four years since Jurassic Park; unfortunately, it also proves how difficult it can be to put together a truly compelling sequel.
The graphic violence is a huge detraction from what is an interesting story.	Isn't nearly as vile as the book and iis certainly watchable, but it's the first Comic Book film of the summer that fails to hit its target.	Wanted tries oh so hard to be the next Matrix, but despite insane amounts of action, falls short.	If the graphic-novel-style hyperviolence of Sin City or 300 is your thing, go ahead and knock yourself out. Or let Angelina do it for you ... It feels so much nicer that way.	The plot has its share of holes, but for those who like shutting off their brains but discovering they might be thinking deeply anyway, Wanted is a worthy diversion.	Wanted is stylish, energetic popcorn fare with witty performances from Angelina Jolie (playing an expert assassin), James McAvoy, and Morgan Freeman that help to distract from its absurdly over-the-top plot.
Then and now, Disney fans of all ages have thrilled to the animation-ambitious sight of the titular pack, and chilled at the villainy of mad diva Cruella De Vil. [Blu-ray]	The definitive telling of an oft-told tale, Disney's family-friendly animated adventure exhibits plenty of energy, wit and style.	However much the film breaks with Disney tradition, it's still a winning effort that mixes cuteness with dry wit in the service of a fast-paced, emotionally charged adventure tale.	101 Dalmatians holds up well after all these years and continues to provide some rousing good fun.	No offence to Glenn Close, but nothing quite compares with the original Cruella DeVille.	With plenty of pooches and a memorable villain (Cruella De Vil), this is one of Disney's most enduring, entertaining animated films.
It's bound to be the funniest movie of the year.	Poorly acted, poorly written, and absolutely entertaining.	A master of the medium shot, [Smith] plops his camera down and records reel after reel of amateurish visuals and partially realized high concepts held afloat by puerile geek humor.	The epitome of self indulgence.	Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is less a satire of the crass product Hollywood hurls at us than a reflection of it.	Fans can expect a good laugh as the cast from Smith's previous films reunite for Jay and Silent Bob's last bow. The loose plotting and crude language may be too much for others though.
Emotionally powerful film of rare and grave subtlety.	Shows that a subdued Nicholson still packs more wallop than nearly all of his peers.	Penn's unending parade of unhappy situations is simply too insistent, his suffocating, claustrophobic worldview more of an assault than the revelation he perhaps hopes it will be.	Drags us through dark places, without convincing us it's a journey worth taking.	A moving and unmannered motion picture -- a convincing portrait of a man at the end of his rope.	Though its subject matter is grim and may make viewers queasy, The Pledge features an excellent, subtle performance by Jack Nicholson.
Schindler's List s'inscrit parmis les meilleurs films de Steven Spielberg et se veut un portrait trиs rйussi de l'holocauste et de l'horreur qui en dйcoule.	There are a few moments -- a handful, out of a three-hour film -- in which Spielberg does push the story into melodrama. As for the rest, though, Schindler's List has a real and unexpected integrity.	one of the most devastatingly emotional films ever made	This is a beautifully crafted, hopeful movie.	What is most memorable is not the tragedy of the lives lost or even the number of people Schindler saved, but how such an imperfect man could have done something so perfect	Schindler's List blends the abject horror of the Holocaust with Steven Spielberg's signature tender humanism to create the director's dramatic masterpiece.
The resulting letdown is terrific, but along the way there is some of the funniest men-at-loose-ends interplay that Wilder has ever put on film.	The prison story had an offbeat flavor that was pleasing.	Classic prisoner-of-war flick, powered by Holden's indelible performance	Stalag 17 leaves you feeling somehow good about life.	As with many of Wilder's films, you tend to forget just how funny it is %u2014 the way the master director cuts tension with incisive wit and barely controlled silliness.	Stalag 17 survives the jump from stage to screen with flying colors, thanks to Billy Wilder's typically sterling direction and a darkly funny script.
At a particularly rundown corner of Almodóvar Boulevard and Tarantino Lane, you'll find Women in Trouble, a limp, forgettable collection of interlocking tales all centering on the eponymous narrative setup.	Unfortunately, while it is a great idea for a sketch, or a web series, it's not a movie length idea.	In the "whatever were they thinking of" genre, a new entry: Women in Trouble.	This forced, charmless multi-character movie pretends to show women in all their glorious variety, but it really just traffics in the same old cliches.	The attractive cast, notably the earthy Gugino, tries hard to invest the one-note characters with a degree of humanity, but are betrayed at every turn by the thin material.	Sebastian Gutierrez certainly has an eye for the beauty of the female form, but Women in Trouble lacks a compelling script or point of view to go with its curvaceous visual appeal.
Even if you have never heard a Wilco album, the film is a great introduction to the band's music and the pain that goes into making it.	Jones gives the faithful a surprisingly intimate portrait of the guardedly vulnerable Tweedy, along with a wealth of potent performance footage that captures Wilco in all its battered and unbowed glory.	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco's last album?	The movie may suffer from creative anemia, but it has sense enough of its raison d'ętre, and the performance sequences carry the day.	It is an often overlooked gem of a movie, chronicling the creative process of making a personal record in more detail than has even been seen. Also, the film is helped tremendously by some great music from Wilco, and a ironic, triumphant twist of real-lif	Besides being a treat for Wilco fans, I Am Trying to Break Your Heart also exposes the workings of a profit-driven music industry.
...War's relentlessly over-the-top visuals and hopelessly convoluted storyline ensure that it generally comes off as yet another needless entry within an exceedingly tired genre.	No one who's witnessed any of the graceful yet blistering combat in the Bourne movies should stand for action sequences that look like they've been edited by an Uzi.	The fatal flaw of War ... is that I don't give two craps about anyone in it.	[Jet] Li and [Jason] Statham's characters represent respect for life and art; they're also purifying a contaminated genre.	By making Corey Yuen the director instead of just the action choreographer, War could have been a far superior film that would have at least satisfied action junkies.	Jet Li and Jason Statham find themselves on opposing sides in the immensely boring War, which is full of clichйs but short on action.
Italian writer-director Alice Rohrwacher captures a conflicted 12-year-old girl's summer straddling childhood and maturity in The Wonders.	...it's clearly an admirably personal piece of work, but one that ultimately walks in the footsteps of too many others for us to really take it into our hearts.	A personal, intimate film riffing on the wonderful strangeness of families - equally capable of love and destructiveness, happiness and despair, often all at the same time	A likable, if sentimental movie.	A beguilingly odd little coming-of-age tale set on the isolated farmstead of a family of beekeepers.	The Wonders offers a charming coming-of-age tale that doubles as a quietly effective tribute to a vanishing way of life.
Italian prog rockers Goblin's tingling, rasping, throbbing score [and] Argento's constantly gliding camera creates an almost unbearable sense of unease and suspense.	A get-under-your-skin makes no sense classic with some of the scariest images ever put on film.	A movie that makes sense only to the eye (and even then . . .).	A direусo de arte e fotografia impecрveis, associadas Я angustiante trilha e Я direусo segura de Argento, compensam as mрs atuaушes e o roteirofraco, criando uma experiЖncia intensa e incЗmoda.	Argento works so hard for his effects -- throwing around shock cuts, colored lights, and peculiar camera angles -- that it would be impolite not to be a little frightened.	The blood pours freely in Argento's classic Suspiria, a giallo horror as grandiose and glossy as it is gory.
A modest but frank look at adolescent lust, both heterosexual and homosexual.	Filmmaker Gay nimbly navigates the raging waters of burgeoning sexuality.	A movie more interested in shocking than in entertaining.	One of the better recent contributions to an over-crowded field.	Explores these adolescent longings and confusions (oh, the confusion!) with sensitivity and subtle humor.	Nico and Dani offers a refreshingly honest look at adolescence and sexual coming-of-age.
The standout song goes to Harris, a rhythmic 'Bare Necessities' extolling the value of a simple life and credited to Terry Gilkyson.	A witty animated feature from Disney based on the famous Rudyard Kipling stories.	It's a slight tale, of course, and incredibly short, but the characters and songs are pretty much perfect viewing time and again.	Jaunty animation meets jazzy songs in Disney classic.	A serious disappointment, recommended only for inveterate Disney fans and very young people.	With expressive animation, fun characters, and catchy songs, The Jungle Book endures as a crowd-pleasing Disney classic.
Among the jewels that Arthur Freed's musicals unit turned out at MGM in the '40s and '50s, Singin' in the Rain is the Hope diamond.	There is no way anyone anywhere won't love Singin' in the Rain!	There is no movie musical more fun than Singin' in the Rain, and few that remain as fresh over the years.	For humour and sheer energy, no musical betters Singin' In The Rain.	Asked to name the top ten moments in the history of movies, most people would include the title number from this movie, in which Gene Kelly splashes and sings in the rain with what Roger Ebert called 'saturated ecstasy.'	Clever, incisive, and funny, Singin' in the Rain is a masterpiece of the classical Hollywood musical.
A dark comedy that blows up like an exploding cigar, leaving nothing much behind but smoke, noise and a bad taste.	If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter, this is it. If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution, this is it.	The filmmakers keep their cynical vision intact through the finale, which is as deliriously happy as the rest of the picture is sardonic.	Collapses under its own meager weight.	[DeVito] misses the mark in his films as often as he hits it, but when he does connect with his material, he can you make you wiggle in discomfort and laugh at the same time.	The talent involved can't save a script that has nowhere to go with its promising premise.
Here is a remarkable exception to the proven principle that all movies with any scene taking place at a football game are stinkers.	Jerry Maguire is slick but not quite believable.	One of the things I liked best about this movie is the quality of the women's characters.	Jerry Maguire is a savvy depiction of a punched-up egomaniac being mauled by the tender hands of love.	Funny and warmhearted, this romantic comedy has it all: a gentle love story, crackling dialogue, social satire and uplifting themes.	Anchored by dazzling performances from Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Renée Zellweger, as well as Cameron Crowe's tender direction, Jerry Maguire meshes romance and sports with panache.
Don't be fooled by the gorgeous Hawaiian setting, glossy sheen or star-studded cast ... Looks are deceiving. "Aloha" is a wreck and squanders every ounce of talent those A-listers possess. You'll be embarrassed for them.	Will probably have viewers and especially critics wanting to say hello to it, but having no problem saying good-bye. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)	This is a romantic comedy that has more than hearts on its mind. In addition to teasing the uneasy and complicated partnership of the military and the private sector, Crowe takes on issues integral to Hawaii.	Anchored by the knockout pairing of Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone, the filmand its characters, and the world they inhabitis difficult to say good-bye to because it's just so effortlessly endearing.	I've never seen a movie quite like Aloha. That's meant neither as praise nor as a backhanded compliment; it's offered more in the spirit of one hand clapping.	Meandering and insubstantial, Aloha finds writer-director Cameron Crowe at his most sentimental and least compelling.
A beautifully made, superbly acted drama that packs a powerfully emotional punch and delivers a passionate message about acceptance.	Argentine writer-director Puenzo invests this tricky story with real soul, bringing the characters and their situation to vivid life.	XXY is the first film to address intersex identity with graceful compassion, and [director] Puenzo tells Alex's story with simple, honest and forthright integrity.	Under Puenzo's attentive yet strangely enervated direction, there's not much dramatic urgency here.	See it not only because it works as an exquisitely tendered emotional experience, but also because it is the first cinematic treatment in fictional form of a taboo-breaking ticklish subject.	This sharp directorial debut by Lucia Puenzo treats the challenging subject of intersexuality with intelligence and sensitivity.
A Knight's Tale is a bouncy pop song of a movie, the snappy/happy kind that puts a grin on your face and a tap to your toe, shifting the heart into high and the mind into neutral.	Features one jousting match after another until you begin to think that they completely forgot to edit the movie at all.	The anachronistic music I can deal with. It was the sheer boredom that annoyed me.	Could use some teeth in more ways than one.	Oh, to be 15 again and truly able to appreciate this movie's simplistic charm!	Once you get past the anachronism, A Knight's Tale becomes a predictable, if spirited, Rocky on horseback.
All the jams are fabulously stirring but not sappy, especially when Fleck duels with a Gambian man on a three-string akonting (forefather to the banjo), but there's nothing more to the film.	The film fails as a personal diary due to Fleck's unflappable aloofness, and the performance footage is rendered unsatisfying by frequent interjections of expository material or cutaways to seaside B-roll that seems photographed for tourist brochures.	There's tragedy lurking behind every story, but also a necessity that transforms mere histories into something sacred.	It's a journey long on affecting songs and musical passages, and short on scholarship -- and that works just fine for Fleck's intentions.	Fleck speaks more with his fingers than in conversation, and the pure musician-to-musician communications joyfully cross language barriers and instrument differences.	Throw Down Your Heart is an exuberant musical journey with an edge of sadness.
Eastern Promises is the first must-see adult film of the young fall.	In his severity, Cronenberg disrupts the audience's immersion in a story that might have become a landmark tale of corruption and conscience...	Cronenberg is his own master, still ready to throw in the sort of scene few other directors could dare.	As bloody good as parts of Eastern Promises are, as a whole it's a bloody mess.	While Eastern Promises works overall on more of a low, insinuating simmer, it's one of Cronenberg's most satisfying pictures.	David Cronenberg triumphs again, showcasing the Viggo Mortensen's onscreen prowess in a daring performance. Bearing the trademarks of psychological drama and gritty violence, Eastern Promises is a very compelling crime story.
You have to wonder what it was that got the talented Macy onboard, aside from a paycheck.	Will future film historians, looking back, consider these CGI animal comedies to be the true horror movies of the 2000s?	Oh dear.	What's next: a Family Circus movie? Where o where is the hero who will save us?	Instead of spending $20 or more on tickets to Marmaduke, read the original strip for free at http://comics.com/marmaduke. In addition to the more agreeable price, it also has more laughs.	Dull and unfunny, Marmaduke offers family filmgoers little more than another round of talking animals and scatological humor.
Any hint of narrative complexity or character development is wiped out by the film's slavishly straightforward storyline, and its special effects that might be state-of-the-art but never show anything we haven't seen before.	just too derivative to take seriously	...Takes an already derivative plot and guts it like so many Urgals.	...Lord of the Potter better captures the blended spirit of the occasion.	While it offers nothing new, it gets a passing grade because it does have some interesting characters, brought to life by some top-notch acting talent.	Written by a teenager (and it shows), Eragon presents nothing new to the "hero's journey" story archetype. In movie terms, this movie looks and sounds like Lord of the Rings and plays out like a bad Star Wars rip-off. The movie spins the tale of a peasant boy who is suddenly entrusted with a dragon and must, with the help of a mentor, train, grow strong, and defeat an evil emperor. The way the critics picture it, the makers of Eragon should soon be expecting an annoyed phone call from George Lucas.
Singer offers barely a whisper of a film, one that's likely to disappoint fan boys and bore the uninitiated.	X-Men is not a disappointment.	When the big battle between Magneto and Xavier's forces gets going, you have lightning bolts, steel claws, magnetic fields, explosive red rays and flyaway tongues. It's a variety show, and all the acts have rushed onstage at once.	As overwrought, over-buzzed, F/X-driven, pure-popcorn summer escapist flicks go, X-Men delivers the goods better than most.	The fast-action fighting sequences are imaginatively choreographed and fascinating, rather like watching gladiators with different weapons going after each other.	Faithful to the comics and filled with action, X-Men brings a crowded slate of classic Marvel characters to the screen with a talented ensemble cast and surprisingly sharp narrative focus.
It's the pace of the film that wins the day.	Only Lucy Liu's insanely perky neighbour emerges with any real credit.	Elaborately hollow tough-guy arabesque	Just when you are ready to dismiss the flick as a blood-soaked semi-black comedy that isn't funny enough, the plot takes a fascinating twist that ups the ante considerably.	worth a look for its refreshing qualities	Trying too hard to be clever in a Pulp Fiction kind of way, this film succums to a convoluted plot, overly stylized characters and dizzying set design.
As a film inspired by British football, this may hold limited appeal for American moviegoers. But it's also a film about a form of spurned love, which means it's a story about love and hate, which means it's a movie that everybody can relate to.	THE DAMNED UNITED is an intriguing study in human ego, and its ability to interfere with sound management.	Despite a rich and complex, powerhouse performance by Michael Sheen, it's hard to sell a biopic when many movie-goers have little awareness of either the subject of British soccer history.	An incredibly entertaining 95 minutes spent in the company of one of the game's most interesting characters, and a testament to the way in which friendship can save us in our darkest hour.	This is a fresh, intelligent transformation, terrifically involving all the way through; it has responded to the human drama and found a persuasive anti-hero in Clough. His story has been recreated as mainstream entertainment with tremendous watchability.	Better than your average football pic, Damned United is carried by another star turn from Michael Sheen as Brian Clough.
The transparency of the plot doesn't really matter. The two leading ladies are so likable that it's a predetermined ending that we want to see happen.	Miss Pettigrew is a feel-good production that strives and succeeds to put smiles on the faces of its viewers.	The laughs are gentle but regular and all roles are played brilliantly, especially McDormand and the gorgeous Amy Adams as Delysia. Miss Pettigrew is 90 minutes of charming escapism - a perfect movie for mums.	Minor and adult, with a bass note of ruefulness underpinning its frothy champagne nose	The characters behave manically--in some imbecilic notion of Anglo farcical style, spitting out their lines with blinding haste--as if speed will conceal their utter lack of wit.	Miss Pettigrew is a breezy period comedy carried by the strong performances of Amy Adams and Frances McDormand.
Can be more of a platform than a chronicle; its look at homophobia and gay marriage is a bit earnest and over-explained. Still, Takei provides a sharp lens through which to see ethnic and sexual minorities' progress in America's post-'50s popular culture.	What made and makes Takei a powerful spokesman is obvious in the film.	No doc could diminish George Takei's life work, but To Be Takei too often takes dramatic short cuts which undermines its potency.	This could have easily been a platitudinous, self-important mess, but Kroot does a couple of very savvy things here.	The doc works best as a relationship study, filled with endearing moments of intimate bickering.	To Be Takei rests almost entirely on its subject's inherent likability -- and, for the most part, that's more than enough.
Sombre and moving in early scenes, and shot with a penumbral grace, the film doesn't quite go the dramatic distance. By final reel, insightful humanity has been replaced by inter-ethnic parable and socio-political point-scoring.	...less a character study than the apparent breaking-in of a camera crew on a sad and sordid life.	Dobroshi, a dark-browed beauty, has an arresting stillness - never smiling (except for one brief, unguarded moment with Sokol), never letting down her guard. It's a slice of a life nobody would want, and a portrait that's not easy to forget.	a moving portrait of emotional and social awakening	It may be the weakest film that the Dardenne's have made to date but that still puts it head-and-shoulders over the best efforts of too many others to mention.	Subtle and emotionally bleak, this gripping thriller features the Dardenne brothers' recognizable penchant for realism and very strong performances.
While most of Millions takes place reality, the audience is invited into Damian's imagination...it becomes the movie that "Finding Neverland" should have been.	A smart, and lively, family entertainment.	One of the most stylish and eccentric films about childhood dreams and heartbreaks that I've ever seen.	Rich, rewarding, and deliciously entertaining	A sweet tale, with just a few bittersweet edges, about children realizing what's really of value in life.	A charming children fable even adults can enjoy.
The awful title should be a warning to you about the film.	The movie's mostly a succession of predictable skits, leavened only by the occasional amusing one-liner and played by actors who aren't actors so much as just a bunch of guys goofing off.	Just a long string of high school-style pranks and hazing exercises. And as with such gags in real life, they're never as much fun for those who aren't taking part.	This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material.	Comedy troupe Broken Lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot.	A more-miss -than-hit affair, Super Troopers will most likely appeal to those looking for something silly.
OK, so it's not a great movie. But like its hero, it has a great heart.	It's like playing Rocky on the Nintendo when you've already played it on the X-Box.	... saura satisfaire autant les fans inconditionnels de la sйrie que les spectateurs qui auront bien voulu lui donner sa chance par simple curiositй	In an achievement befitting the boxer, Stallone delivers a sucker punch in finding a way to make this underdog comeback story succeed.	The old bastard's done it again. Sylvester Stallone has done with this film what his character does in the movie: he has come out and delivered that last fight that all fighters are supposed to have left in them.	Implausible but entertaining and poignant, Rocky Balboa finds the champ in fighting form for the first time in years.
A warm, funny, engaging film.	Expect no major discoveries, nor any stylish sizzle, but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women.	You watch for that sense of openness, the little surprises.	It's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity.	Given its winning story line and a terrific performance by newcomer America Ferrera in the lead, Real Women Have Curves could become the next My Big Fat Greek Wedding.	Even though Real Women is another coming-of-age tale, it's a real charmer.
It's horrible. It's wretched. It's Limburger pickled in castor oil.	I would have loved to see what Pixar could have done with the material.	It's got a couple of clever ideas. I thought the animation was uninspired and it's kind of forgettable.	The animation isn't even comparable to the original Toy Story, but the clever wit behind the plot and characters is.	A very rare example of a non-Pixar/Aardman kiddie pic that adults might enjoy more than the youngsters.	This fractured fairytale doesn't have the wit or animation quality to compete with the likes of the Shrek franchise.
What's intended to be a trippy, philosophical sci-fi parable winds up more overwrought than unsettling.	Sci-fi lovers should find it risible, and those who devalue the genre will have their biases confirmed.	Creepy thriller too confusing for kids, awful for adults.	Badly paced, plotted, directed and acted, the film really defies understanding how and why anyone other than Kelly not only would want to see it, but would make it in the first place.	Goes off on a bunch of wild, convoluted tangents that don't add up and grow sillier by the minute. By the time nosebleed epidemics, watery portals and NASA experiments are added into the mix, the picture has walked off a ledge it never recovers from.	Imaginative but often preposterous, The Box features some thrills but largely feels too piecemeal.
But it is almost three hours long. And it is so drippy.	Every audience sniffle and tear has been taken into account.	one of the last and most successful products of a less-cynical cinematic age	One of the finest examples of escapist musical entertainment. The Sound of Music is a terrific picture.	Watching it just makes you feel wonderful.	Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.
Could this somehow be even better than "The Godfather"? Decide for yourself while I go watch both movies.	One of the best sequels ever made.	A rarity: a sequel as great as its A+ predecessor. A powerhouse film.	De Niro makes a great Vito, and seems to channel Marlon Brando as he transforms into the Don. While compelling in their own right, these flashbacks provide a break from Michael's single-mindedness, and clearly outline the similarities between the two men.	[It] not only lived up to the artistic and dramatic excellence of the first film, but in many ways surpassed it.	Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.
This is a rich tale that depends not on intricacies of plot but character interaction to provide its adrenaline thrills...A truly mature work from Greengrass and his colleagues, and easily one of the best films of the year.	For all its action aesthetics and nail-biting, gut-wrenching tension, this is on some level a film about globalisation, about what happens when the paths of the very poor and the very rich intersect in the crossfire of world economics.	Sometimes, the most awe-inspiring superhero movies are the ones culled from fact-based events. This gripping thriller is an excellent example.	The sea is not the only thing that is rough in Paul Greengrass's emotionally tense film in which the twists and turns of its real-life hostage drama are as unpredictable as the waves on which it takes place	The disappointing aspect to Captain Phillips is that it doesn't go beyond action movie conventions.	Smart, powerfully acted, and incredibly intense, Captain Phillips offers filmgoers a Hollywood biopic done right -- and offers Tom Hanks a showcase for yet another brilliant performance.
At World's End includes a whole lot of chitchat, as the characters strain to explain this overplotted extravaganza. Sure, the pirates need reasons to swing swords at each other, but do they really need this many?	An epic spectacle in every sense of the word, "Pirates 3" is a non stop journey to all corners of the earth.	The plot's a trippy, twisty mess, and it's far too long, but it looks fantastic and makes some bold choices in its execution. And once again Jack's back to save the day.	Both sequels to the original film are confusing and long. But the third does improve on the second, because at least something happens.	One of the best wrap-ups of a trilogy in recent memory.	POTC: AWE provides the thrilling action scenes, but mixes in too many characters with too many incomprehensible plot threads.
A fetching and funny family film with special appeal to dog lovers.	Ultimately a tribute to the Power of Cute Pooches; despite all the film's shortcomings, the dogs deliver genuine laughs and prove to be thoroughly engaging protagonists.	It needs something quite special to save this film from toxic splurges of sentiment. Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon duly oblige as a pair of fabulously awful foster parents.	It may not be Hotel Rwanda, but Don Cheadle does bring a nice dose of compassion to Hotel for Dogs.	Undemanding tykes will gets their giggles flowing with the Rube Goldberg-style contraptions invented for the dogs.	Hotel for Dogs may appeal to children and dog lovers, but it's ultimately contrived, predictable, and simplistic.
The premise is unusual, the impact is overwhelming.	The movie reinforces his gift for dialogue, but his ability to handle actors, compose scenes or keep track of his own story is negligible.	The third installment of Kevin Smith's New Jersey Trilogy is also the only Kevin Smith movie that's worth any serious attention.	...rivals a 1930s screwball comedy -- although the subject matter certainly does not.	In-your-face with an attitude that's as tactless as it is honest.	Chasing Amy explores gender roles, sexual mores, and the limits of friendship with a mixture of sensitivity, raw honesty, and director/screenwriter Kevin Smith's signature raunchy humor.
The stream of jerky, fuzzy, static-riddled and otherwise distressed visuals...[is] a trick that's gone stale, and 'Apollo 18' doesn't freshen it up	Less concerned with depth and more about the strict skillfulness of capturing an increasingly queasy tone and mood. This is where it works.	The documentary look and feel of the movie is impressive until it is overcome by the inaneness of the plot	Apollo 18 always seems like an attempt at a scary movie edited by scary movie-makers, rather than an actual document from the NASA vaults.	...let's have an end to this misbegotten subgenre of 'found footage' movies.	A boring, suspense-free Paranormal Activity rip-off that feels long even at just 90 minutes.
The Aristocrats may not be as insightful as it purports to be, but it is good for a few gut laughs - if you've got the stomach for it.	It's a fascinating peek into the closed world of stand-up humorists past and present.	a voyeuristic peek into the sick minds that make America laugh	It's hard to imagine a documentary more foul-mouthed or jaw-droppingly, side-splittingly hilarious.	The film is utterly, unbelievably, pants-wettingly hilarious -- and insightful about the workings of comedy, too.	Can a joke stand up to repeated tellings? Hilarious and revealing of the way comedy works, The Aristocrats demonstrates that it's possible.
A picture that has all the charm of 'Cool World' and all the laughs of 'Larger Than Life'...a pretty noxious combination.	Osmosis Jones could have been a real charmer if everybody had been on the same page.	This is the kind of premise you'd expect to be filmed as a five-minute educational video, if at all. But this feature is 95 minutes and never drags.	never quite takes off the way you're hoping it will	This animated road map of one man's toxic dump of a body is as ingenious as it is amusing.	The animated portion of Osmosis is zippy and fun, but the live-action portion is lethargic.
It's great fun most of the way and makes up in humor what it lacks in sense.	The picture packs a wonderful wallop.	Too cute, too clever, too damn smug.	The humour, the pathos, the tension - even the blooming soundtrack - all conspire to ensure that the tale of a teenager traveling back 30 years to ensure his parents meet and ultimately mate can, given its vintage, now be fairly described as a classic.	Few movies have reached this level of light comic perfection. It's the perfect blend of the novelty of the 1950's and the comic angst of adolescence.	Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.
Art and artifice are sometimes a necessary buffer between reality and our minds	Complex, challenging and at times difficult to watch, Waltz With Bashir is nevertheless wholly unique, unquestionably powerful and, ultimately, a devastating indictment of war and its effects on its victims and its participants.	A powerfully ambiguous meditation on personal and collective avoidance.	A unique, Oscar-nominated 'animated documentary' that uses graphic-novel-style animation to deal with the Israeli army's participation in the Lebanon war of 1982.	The cert and name suck, but don't let that put you off. Bashir is history without being hard graft. Immensely moving, the world may stubbornly refuse to move on, but cinema like this can nudge it in the right direction.	A wholly innovative, original, and vital history lesson, with pioneering animation, Waltz With Bashir delivers its message about the Middle East in a mesmerizing fashion.
This is both a sloppy mystery, with meaningless clues everywhere, and a tedious comedy, with jokes that seem to date from before Scream turned satirizing horror movies into a cottage industry.	A few gags are brilliantly staged, but most have a smug, collegiate take-it-or- leave-it quality that makes full-on belly laughter feel optional.	The biggest problem with the film is that it's not as funny as it should be.	[W]hat's refreshing about the Broken Lizard films is how removed they seem from the cookie-cutter Hollywood machine.	...has the kind of energy so zealous that one can't help but notice the filmmakers simply using it as a mask to cover up obvious shortcomings.	Comedy is too hit-or-miss is this slasher spoof.
Side Effects is a hell of a thriller, twisty, terrific and packed with surprises you don't see coming.	Steven Soderbergh's superb (and supposedly final) film offers twists and intrigue in its dark examination of prescription medication.	Soderbergh came, he saw, he conquered, and now he's moving on.	Performances are generally fine with the glaring exception of a laughably earnest Catherine Zeta Jones (channelling '90s Demi Moore) as Emily's previous therapist.	It's difficult to escape the impression that the movie is impressed only with its cleverness.	A smart, clever thriller with plenty of disquieting twists, Side Effects is yet another assured effort from director Steven Soderbergh.
No pun intended, but all the stars aligned for this film. It was the perfect blend of British and American humor.	Like many of the best English comedies, much of the humor here is based on character, good-natured high spirits, and fairly uninhibited vulgarity.	Kevin Kline won the Supporting Actor Oscar for this funny and enjoyable farce, based on original script by John Cleese and Charles Crichton	Mixing acerbic Pythonesque humour with a sweet rom-com touch and wonderful comic performances, this may be the finest hour for any former Python.	Somehow, the movie manages to do the impossible: It makes John Cleese less than hilarious.	Smartly written, smoothly directed, and solidly cast, A Fish Called Wanda offers a classic example of a brainy comedy with widespread appeal.
A hysterically funny and always revolting spoof from the twisted mind of a creature feature fan.	...the lack of character development and distinctly uneven pacing prevents it from becoming as much fun as Gunn clearly wants it to be.	It's refreshing to see a movie like Slither, which has obviously been made by someone with a deep affection for the glory gory days of American horror comedy.	It's hilarious, gross, and insanely watchable! What would a Troma film look like if they had a decent script and a big budget? Like Slither!	A monstrously funny alien-invasion-zombie-horror-comedy.	A slimy, B-movie homage oozing with affection for low-budget horror films, Slither is creepy and funny -- if you've got the stomach for it.
... a gritty and suspenseful exploration of violence that's more about corporate conflict than brute force.	A smartly directed character study of a man fighting to uphold the antiquated ideals of the American Dream.	A lot of movies spin their wheels fast and create the illusion that important things are happening. A Most Violent Year, one of the best movies of 2014, does the opposite.	I think this is a pretty major piece of adult emotional entertainment, something special, and I hope we get a lot more like it from him.	What makes the movie interesting is its hard-boiled (and, one suspects, realistic) look at the realities of making a profit in a rough-and-tumble business.	Gritty, gripping, and weighted with thought-provoking heft, A Most Violent Year represents another strong entry in writer-director J.C. Chandor's impressive filmography.
Well-acted war drama is too intense for kids.	If you like to have your heart wrenched out in the cinema, this is for you. Even though it's a remake of the outstanding 2004 Danish original directed by Suzanne Bier (released here in 2006), Brothers carries a mighty payload of drama	Jim Sheridan's plodding direction and the miscasting of Maguire mean that it looks too much like glossy melodrama to involve many people's emotions.	This is a powerful, disturbing film that explores common cinematic territory -- the ability of war to destroy the individual -- without seeming clichéd or familiar.	Director Sheridan effectively contrasts the domestic character-driven drama set in suburban America with genuinely harrowing and authentic war sequences.	It plays more like a traditional melodrama than the Susanne Bier film that inspired it, but Jim Sheridan's Brothers benefits from rock-solid performances by its three leads.
In terms of Jim Henson-style wonderment and overall cleverness, "Muppets from Space" comes up short. It's entertaining enough, but lacks the magic the Muppets are so skilled at summoning.	The new Muppets movie lacks the kind of excitement the first ones generated.	"Fooll Preece-a Feetoore" says the Swedish Chef!	Thin in its ideas and surprises.	Smart and winning, this sixth Muppet feature film comes closest to recapturing the pure joy of the 1979 original!	If Muppets from Space lacks the magic and wit of its cinematic predecessors, this pleasingly silly space romp is funny and clever enough to make for better-than-average family entertainment.
A full-frontal formalist assault on the very concept of celebrity bio-pics... drifting and riffing on contradictions, drop-dead funny, and easily the most go-for-broke, energizing movie I've seen all year.	Perhaps the whole weird, scattershot thing might play better when you can skip-search to your favorite bits.	Forget the six impersonations of Bob Dylan. Ultimately, I'm Not There is all about Todd Haynes trying to be Jean-Luc Godard.	It's well-acted but also a bit long and will probably be of less interest to those who aren't already fans of Dylan or his music.	There's a 90-minute masterpiece in this film, waiting for an editor to find it.	I'm Not There's unique editing, visuals, and multiple talented actors portraying Bob Dylan make for a deliciously unconventional experience. Each segment brings a new and fresh take on Dylan's life.
The offbeat teen comedy gets off to a good start, but when it takes off in space the spoof becomes too alien to be anything more nourishing than junk food for the soul.	Their space trip may be familiar, but they make it fun.	The one that started it all! Started what? No idea!	A strange, wounded beast, filled with wonderful sequences and homemade charm, but also confused and anticlimactic.	It looks terrific, moves along at a gallop, and is marvellously good-natured.	With a terrific young cast (including Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix) and some typically energetic work from director Joe Dante, Explorers soars past its '80s kiddie flick competitors with wit, good-looking effects, and tons of charm.
What's most visible in the movie is the engaging acting. Murphy and Aykroyd are perfect foils for each other.	Hilarious chemistry between Aykroyd and Murphy.	what you might imagine a Frank Capra film would be like if it were reimagined for the Reagan era and starring a couple of stand-out comedians from Saturday Night Live	The rise of Valentine and the fall of Winthorpe are a source of great fun.	An altogether hilarious concoction that features Dan Aykroyd at his strongest, Eddie Murphy at his freewheeling funniest, and director John Landis at the absolute top of his game.	Featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, Trading Places is an immensely appealing social satire.
Entertaining and innovative animated film.	Watching the dead-eyed population of Polar Express and their supposedly 'natural' movements made me think more of Gollum in "The Lord of the Rings" than anything associated with Christmas.	Yet another case of Hollywood taking a slight, charming, deeply satisfying book (Chris Van Allsburg's Caldecott-winning title is only 29 pages long, and 26 of those are illustrations) and inflating it into a ponderous movie.	Its rich characters, spectacular visuals, and unbridled sense of awe and wonder make this the kind of movie families will want to watch together every holiday season.	Upon arriving at in the... North Pole, [the movie] becomes a behind-the-scenes adventure that captures a certain wonder the computer-created characters cannot on their own.	Though the movie is visually stunning overall, the animation for the human characters isn't lifelike enough, and the story is padded.
It's more than just that great car chase. The whole film is gritty, down-to-earth and enjoyable.	A not-very-good movie redeemed by a car chase for the ages.	If more attention had been paid to plot and characterisation, this would have been a great rather than a good movie. Even so, it stands as a cinematic landmark.	Apart from the car chase, the gritty, realistic take on police work makes this thriller classic.	The action sequences are brilliant, done without trickery in real locations (including a great car chase which spawned a thousand imitations) to lend an extraordinary sense of immediacy to the shenanigans and gunfights.	Steve McQueen is cool as ice in this thrilling police procedural that also happens to contain the arguably greatest car chase ever.
Downbeat but surprisingly moving drama.	The film fits neatly into Winterbottom's eclectic canon.	It's a 90-minute newsreel with a broken heart.	Puts something like a personal face on what is so often rendered merely as an abstract statistic: the plight of the contemporary refugee in a violently 'globalized' world.	Although the story is fictional, Winterbottom uses real people, a small filming crew, available light and digital cameras to create a raw story.	Using documentary-style filmmaking to blur the lines between fact and fiction. In This World tells a harrowing but important story about the plight of refugees.
Director Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script with brother Jonathan, gets so many of the big things right that I wished they had taken more time with the little ones.	A sprawling and crazily ambitious epic that builds on the achievement of the previous films instead of merely copying them and takes more genuine risks than any major film of the size and scope than Nolan's equally audacious "Inception."	Nolan's finale gives us the inevitable with generous portions of suspense, surprise and delicious shock.	There are too many logic gaps, and far too few moments of intimacy. In the midst of things, however, there's no denying its grandeur.	The Dark Knight Rises succeeds because it's rooted in real-world experiences and fears.	The Dark Knight Rises is an ambitious, thoughtful, and potent action film that concludes Christopher Nolan's franchise in spectacular fashion.
[An] instant cult classic.	Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast.	The ads for Aliens claim that this movie will frighten you as few movies have, and, for once, the ads don't lie.	Blockbuster combination of blistering action, smart sci-fi and gooey monsters.	There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles.	While Alien was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver.
It often has a camp ludicrousness, evoking an 'Afterschool Special' inspired by the pages of Penthouse Forum.	Not a single thing anyone says feels true or original.	Bogged down in a wearying tone of longing, intense heartbreak and mad symbolic flights of Shakespeare.	Their characters may feel lost, but Ms. Perabo and Ms. Paré rank among the finds of the year.	Never touches a core of real feeling, instead becoming monumentally silly as Paulie descends into obvious metaphor.	Lost and Delirious becomes exactly that, as the film sinks into overwrought melodrama and cliched, obvious symbolism.
Served up with enough charm that it never feels tired or base.	Lima ... hits all the obvious notes hard, and must be held to account for indulging so much hammy mugging from his cast.	Spirited entertainment for all but the youngest members of the group (Oddball faces peril that will haunt little ones).	A film without mirth or magic.	The film runs a bit too long to hold the interest of most kids ... and it isn't witty enough to entertain adults who made it past the fourth grade.	This sequel to the live-action 101 Dalmatians is simply more of the same. Critics say it also drags in parts, potentially boring children, and that it's too violent for a G-rated movie.
An epic treatment of epic themes that doesn't soft-soap its audience, but at the same time provides a terrifically satisfying entertainment.	Told with a blend of visual mastery and emotional intimacy, ambitious venture sustains a special melding of romance and pragmatism that should engage discerning audiences.	A hopeful, funny movie.	Ultimately, Jeunet's stylistic excesses get the best of him here, making the film an experience that feels uncomfortably like its title.	This ravishing, archetypal romance has such vitality and incandescent charm that it all comes together beautifully, without ever degenerating into kitsch.	A well-crafted and visually arresting drama with a touch of whimsy.
crap	There are laughs in Balls, but not nearly enough of them.	Funnily enough, though -- and it's the only thing funny about this dreadful excuse for a comedy -- the movie itself has tiny balls. It's got no nerve, no guts, no daring... no balls.	Super BAD!	A loose string of emaciated ideas that probably cracked up the writer's room, but on the screen it looks sloppy and unrehearsed.	Tasteless, yet harmless, Balls of Fury nevertheless fails to generate enough laughs despite its lowbrow intentions.
A live-action video game gussied up with bad, Matrix-style bullet-time photo tricks and what must be a record amount of just plain bullets released in a PG-13-rated film.	The cheapest and most nonsensical slice of quasi-Science Fiction silliness since Freejack.	The pace and inventiveness -- the epilogue is surprisingly touching -- and the eye-popping moves of Jet Li make it easy to hang on and enjoy the ride.	Confusing plot holes, cut-out characters and cretinous dialogue undercut the visual feast.	The One is one vacuous hole of a movie.	The One plays out more like a video game than a movie and borrows freely from other, better sci-fi actioners like the The Matrix. Also, Jet Li's martial arts abilities are buried under the editing and special effects.
Like its women, the movie from the perspective of the viewer is ravishingly beautiful but frustratingly remote.	A visually sumptuous action drama by Zhang Yimou, who proves himself to be the Busby Berkeley of our times.	I wanted to be swept away, but even with half of China as extras, I was mostly unimpressed.	If the overwrought dramatics are like an opera drained of its music, that's a price you may be willing to pay for the purely sensual pleasure the images afford.	Director Zhang Yimou has an incredible eye for color, and this offering does not disappoint when it comes to the exquisite employment of a vibrant palette.	Melodrama, swordplay, and CG armies -- fans of martial arts epic will get what they bargain for, though the baroque art direction can be both mesmerizing and exhaustively excessive.
Of course, there are some things you can always count on in a Sparks adaptation - sandy locations, star-crossed lovers and searing melodrama, all tied in a neat emotionally manipulative bow.	There's an audience for old-fashioned romance, and Dear John will please most of it, given its attractive cast, cozy beach settings and brazenly uplifting outlook on human nature.	There is not much point throwing Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried into a movie together if they can't devote every waking minute to making out.	Lasse Hallstrom's Dear John tells the heartbreaking story of two lovely young people who fail to find happiness together because they're trapped in an adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel.	What has happened to the estimable Hallstrom? His new movie is dull, static, and literal, and it's not even well acted.	Built from many of the same ingredients as other Nicholas Sparks tearjerkers, Dear John suffers from its cliched framework, as well as Lasse Hallstrom's curiously detached directing.
The Walt Disney Company has broken the vaults wide open to add a plethora of fascinating historic artifacts to make this new Platinum Edition a must-own for any Disney collector.	Ornamented with some bright and lilting tunes, it is a lively feature-length Technicolor excursion into a world that glows with an exhilarating charm and a gentle joyousness.	Definitely a Disney classic but misses out much of the darker side of J.M.Barrie's fantasy tale.	Stereotypes mar otherwise jaunty Disney adventure.	Not an especially mature film, probably the most "kiddie movie" of all the 1950s Disney features.	Though it doesn't delve deeply into the darkness of J.M. Barrie's tale, Peter Pan is a heartwarming, exuberant film with some great tunes.
Female heroes permeate most of Disney's animated movies, but this is the first time they've given her real strength.	Memo to the gang at Walt Disney animation: Your formula is showing.	Disney's tried-and-true blend of populist instincts and weightier interests is back in full force and top form.	Mulan is artful and satisfying in a slightly remote way.	A film that adults can enjoy on their own, without feeling an obligation to take along kids as a cover.	Exploring themes of family duty and honor, Mulan breaks new ground as a Disney film, while still bringing vibrant animation and sprightly characters to the screen.
Oh, those crazy doctors, when will they ever learn to stop messing around with the natural order of life and death?	It's simply the best, funniest Grand Guignol horror picture to come along in ages.	A campy horror classic with style	a retelling of Frankenstein with a psychosexual spin... an infectiously fun foray into science at its most insane and least ethical, as the mind's higher goals are repeatedly driven by the body's basest desires.	Re-Animator exploits our fears of segmentation, of being many fragments of a body living independently.	Perfectly mixing humor and horror, the only thing more effective than Re-Animator's gory scares are its dry, deadpan jokes.
Winehouse was a complicated artist who deserved a nuanced, honest look at her life. In lesser hands, Amy could be a feature-length E! True Hollywood Story, but Kapadia treats his subject with respect and heart.	It's hard to imagine another film coming closer to truly explaining the tragic enigma that was Amy Winehouse.	A powerful, and powerfully sad, experience.	An overwhelmingly tragic and absorbing portrait piece.	Separates fame and success, person and star.	As riveting as it is sad, Amy is a powerfully honest look at the twisted relationship between art and celebrity -- and the lethal spiral of addiction.
The Rocka-who?	It's a great comic-book style adventure with good humor, thrills and charm, and it's entertaining.	A hell of a lot of fun...lots of energy, spirit and adventure!	An overlooked classic that is alive with the heroics and nostalgia of big-studio era Hollywood.	lives and breathes with the spirit of the old adventure pulp comics or Saturday matinee serials. Its charms will probably be lost on most of this jaded generation	An action-packed, if anachronistic, look back at pulp matinee serials, The Rocketeer may ring hollow with viewers expecting more than simple fun and gee-whiz special effects.
so far fetched that I couldn't swallow the story	It becomes more and more fun as the twists pile up -- not entirely convincing, but diverting, like something concocted by a bright eighth-grader.	Engages the viewer from start to finish and boasts a handful of decent performances. Crazy but fun.	The most vapid stars of our age, Hayden Christensen and Jessica Alba, achieve total vapidosity in this jaw-dropping exercise in preposterosity from newcomer Joby Harold.	It's not a great movie by any means, but as a throwaway thriller with a terrific mid-movie twist, it's not bad way to spend 84 minutes.	Awake has an interesting premise but would have benefited from tighter performances and more efficient direction and editing.
A filmmaker blossoming into true greatness... Pan's Labyrinth is a film of breathtaking emotional, thematic and visual depth.	A fairy tale without the Disneyfication	With Pan's Labyrinth, director Guillermo del Toro taps the same magical vein that made his Devil's Backbone so memorable.	Pan's Labyrinth us that such fantasy offers no real escape from dreadful reality.	Guillermo Del Toro creates an alternate reality where danger is a constant state and where fantasy and reality are equally vivid.	Pan's Labyrinth is Alice in Wonderland for grown-ups, with the horrors of both reality and fantasy blended together into an extraordinary, spellbinding fable.
The idea of "The Imposter" is more intriguing than the film's execution.	A mesmerizing con-artist comedy and a chilling true crime thriller...	The story is astonishing enough on its own, and The Imposter succeeds in enhancing its immediacy and intensity.	Sporting a sly grin that's just this side of sinister, Bourdin makes a riveting subject, not least because he could still be an unreliable narrator.	One of the year's most provocative pictures.	Despite its true-crime trappings, The Imposter is an utterly gripping and sometimes heartbreaking documentary thriller cleverly told with narrative flair.
Basically a slice of formulaic Hollywood-style mythmaking, writ large and woefully empty.	Add to the impressive cannon of recent World War II resistance films, that include "Black Book," "Flame and Citron" and "Army of Crime," this engaging true story about a group of Norwegian freedom fighters--called the "Oslo Group"...	A stirring tribute to the wartime sacrifices made in the name of a just cause.	An entertaining, old-school war thriller.	Directors Espen Sandberg and Joachim Ronning have not only crafted an enlightening biographical tale but a film, not unlike recent Oscar winner The Hurt Locker, that also conveys the addictive nature and ultimate futility of combat.	This good old-fashioned Norwegian WW2 film has impressive set pieces and never suffers for a lack of suspense.
A generic conspiracy thriller that struggles to qualify as average.	Basically, it's a treat for fans of 24 and Desperate Housewives to see Jack Bauer running around with Gabrielle Solis - they make a great double act and should be given their own show immediately.	sleepy	Wrestled to the ground by one preposterous plot turn after another.	The actors look uniformly unhappy to be there.	The Sentinel starts off well enough but quickly wears thin with too many plot holes and conventional action sequences.
The jokes are lame, forced, and stretched thin, as is the romance between O'Connell and Evie, and both seem like unwelcome interruptions from the main story.	A raucous and entertaining action horror entry with great performances, and a vicious villain.	One more overblown exercise in big budget lameness!	It's cheerful, slightly cheesy entertainment!	A failure in more ways than a mortal would have time to explain!	It's difficult to make a persuasive argument for The Mummy as any kind of meaningful cinematic achievement, but it's undeniably fun to watch.
Its archetypal influence on later films like Goodfellas and the Al Pacino Scarface is striking, even if we can never again experience how new and bold it was back in its day....	Cagney supercharges the entire film with frenetic energy.	White Heat's ultimate message: love's a *****...even crypto-incestuous love.	Raoul Walsh's heroes had a knack for going too far, but none went further than James Cagney in this roaring 1949 gangster piece.	Raoul Walsh's Freudian film is one of the fastest and toughest crime-gangster films ever made, boasting a bravura performance from James Cagney as a misogynist mama boy ("top of the world, Ma").	Raoul Walsh's crime drama goes further into the psychology of a gangster than most fear to tread and James Cagney's portrayal of the tragic anti-hero is constantly volatile.
It's hard to dislike all these urban musicals aimed at teenage girls, and even harder to tell them apart.	The film should have been called Rehash Dance, because it is Flashdance without any new ideas.	We know the trajectory, it's a question of how brightly the rocket burns and how interested we are in the astronauts aboard this dance missile from small town Indiana to Chicago Big Time Dance School	Then you wait for the moment one of the regular girls gets injured, the hostess has to find a replacement and... the rest you know.	Despite boundless energy and some surprisingly artful photography, 'Make it Happen' is never more than product. Cheap, abysmally scripted and utterly soulless.	Cheap, predictable, formulaic and unimaginative generic dance film. Comes across as Showgirls for simpleton teens, but with much less flesh on show.
Just when you think all the great rock and roll stories have been told, along comes "Lambert & Stamp," about two guys from different sides of the tracks who guided The Who to guitar-smashing glory.	Fascinating, but almost as chaotic and disorganized as the band itself	This fascinating documentary - packed by cinematographer-turned-documentarian James D Cooper with a kaleidoscope of archive footage and informed by illuminating, funny and affectionate interviews - can scarcely fail to entertain and charm.	There are candid interviews from Stamp, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey and pleasurable acres of archival footage.	James D. Cooper's impeccably directed debut is a definitive screen bio of the Who and its-rock operatic rise.	A sharp accounting of an era framed through the early adventures of the Who and the managers who helped make them famous, Lambert & Stamp should prove fascinating for fans and novices alike.
Lumbering docudrama.	Part perky educational film, part goofy New Age recruitment effort, What the Bleep Do We Know? switches between abstract and practical modes.	Challenging, cryptic, mystical...The only profound mystery the experts don't try to answer is this: To which #$*! alternate universe do all those missing dryer socks go?	A turgid, Enya-synth infomercial for New Age enlightenment.	New Age hooey disguised as a scientific documentary about quantum physics.	Educational, but as entertainment, it'll have viewers asking, 'What the bleep?'
For the biggest fans, it may be the single best movie going experience you will have this year	Entertaining, well made documentary that's a treat for fans thanks to its wealth of rarely seen footage and newly filmed interviews...	PJ is far from the key band of its moment (and where's that movie?), resulting in a doc that feels padded.	A great introduction to the band as well as a great recap for the fans who have been there all along the way.	A deadly combination of fanboy, friend, and Richie Cunningham, Crowe has zero objectivity about the band	Cameron Crowe's fawning documentary is a true boon for Pearl Jam fans, but the band's insistent resistance to fame comes off hollow.
Bloom's listless performance dooms the film. Where is Russell Crowe when you need him?	Ridley Scott shies from addressing faith.	While it will soon be forgotten and its central message ignored by those in power, it's a great looking film that's better than recent 'epics'.	Most of the actors have elected to play their knights like crotchety Western gunslingers, a bizarre choice that blows a good deal of fresh air into the stuffy pageantry.	A staggeringly lazy, leg-twitchingly dull, unholy mess.	Although it's an objective and handsomely presented take on the Crusades, Kingdom of Heaven lacks depth.
It shows plenty of promise at the beginning, and even though that promise isn't kept, Giamatti's performance will keep your interest.	The inventiveness of Barthes' story is matched by a sense of visual fluidity that's especially striking in a first feature.	More ridiculous than thought-provoking.	A refreshingly imaginative, funny and intelligent sci-fi drama boasting a superb performance by Paul Giamatti.	Theatrical tale, well-acted, heavy on mood but light on meaning.	Straddling existential drama and surrealist comedy, Sophie Barthes debut feature is beautifully shot and full of inventive quandaries.
What was a film worth taking the time to divine value from becomes the biggest, and most expensive, waste of time in several years.	There's no dismissing the film, if only because it offers another long, loud example of how Hollywood remains the hagiographic spinmeister of American war history.	There's a certain symbolic symmetry here. The Navy and Walt Disney have teamed up on the production, and both view history as something to be managed and exploited.	While sheer spectacle may be good enough for an ever-easy-to-please moviegoing public, it cannot be for Bay, who so clearly, desperately strove for so much more.	Unbelievably, the film's recreation of December 7, 1941, in which Japanese submarines and carrier-based planes attacked the U.S. Pacific fleets, is so impersonal and unfocused that it had this reviewer nodding off.	Pearl Harbor tries to be the Titanic of war movies, but it's just a tedious romance filled with laughably bad dialogue. The 40 minute action sequence is spectacular though.
Dunn effortlessly smashes the cliché of metal-bands-as-Neanderthal-lunkheads.	Brings on a variety of eloquent voices from both the fanbase and the gods of metal themselves.	It'll make you want to dig out your Whitesnake T-shirt. It might even convince Tipper Gore that heavy metal thunder is all in good fun.	It's a measure of Dunn's success that even a total nonfan like myself could find his journey interesting.	This documentary about one of the most loathed, lampooned and beloved music genres isn't the kind of film to rock your world, though it may well inspire laughter.	Made by a metalhead, this documentary of the musical genre both informs and entertains with its range of interviewees.
Some of the richest imagery the studio's animators have produced and held together.	It didn't really need the 3D, but it's still a stunning, glorious family film, with the third dimension or otherwise.	This often dark tale about a lion cub holds real emotional resonance.	Overall, The Lion King's sarcastic humor and powerful visuals make it well worth the trip to the theater.	A film of unusual visual and emotional magnitude for Disney.	Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, The Lion King stands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic family films.
Self-consciously elegiac, The Yards is a slow-burning but meticulously crafted family melodrama posing as a thriller.	The comparisons gang up on the movie. This is a fair crime story but nowhere a great family crime story.	Ultimately, I left the theater saying 'so what?'	The true star of the film was the cinematography.	The only thing the movie lacks is a pulse.	Featuring strong performances and direction, The Yards is a richly textured crime thriller with an authentic feel.
Its straightforward simplicity aims it squarely at the kiddies and the kiddies alone, but that's okay -- few films intended for children these days are this gentle, this plainly decent.	The special effects are too obvious at times, and in trying to impart an eccentric vibe, Helm relies too heavily on kooky camera angles.	No wise child, let alone grown-up, will touch this with a turkey baster.	It's well made, and adults likely will find themselves yielding to its gentle, whimsical charm.	Like the store, the movie is chockablock with playthings -- puns, graphics, and music -- that make the life lessons easier to absorb.	Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium's title is much more fun that the film itself, as the colorful visuals and talented players can't make up for a bland story.
Terry Gilliam shows more pure creativity in this film than in any of his others.	It's an opulent odyssey that balances romance, comedy and thrills in one glittering and constantly surprising package.	The carnivalesque chaos is anchored in stage actor John Neville's charismatic lead turn.	Despite a second-act sag, the visuals make The Adventures of Baron Munchausen a worthwhile film.	Weird to the Gilliamth degree, Munchausen just might making being an 'uneven' movie a compliment.	Bursting with Terry Gilliam's typically imaginative flourishes, this story of a possibly deranged Baron recounting his storied life is a flamboyant and witty visual treat.
By the end, it all pays off exactly the way a hundred earlier Westerns did.	For audiences accustomed to revisionist Westerns, only the relocation to Down Under will be a novelty since the film follows Sam Peckinpah's blood-soaked template.	Violent but compelling yarn.	A pitiless yet elegiac Australian Western as caked with beauty as it is with blood.	In the end, it feels like Nihilism for Newcomers or maybe Sartre With Six-Shooters.	Brutal, unflinching, and violent, but thought-provoking and with excellent performances, this Australian western is the one of the best examples of the genre to come along in recent times.
Bubblegum for the brain.	What I enjoyed more than the specific parodies was the spirit behind them.	Director Jay Roach seems helpless to rein in the addled antics of his star or to give the supporting cast much of a grip on what they're supposed to be doing.	The film's singlemindedness is so dauntless and just plain nutty that it's hard to resist.	One of the year's best comedies!	A light and goofy comedy which provides laughs, largely due to performances and screenwriting by Myers.
Although some will predictably succumb to Gray's overly kinetic and slick-looking heist caper, this stylized action-packed robbers flick fails to steal anything worth value within this repetitive genre.	A slickly-made tongue-in-cheek heist movie with a marvelous cast and nifty stunts.	F. Gary Gray's "The Italian Job" isn't Art, but it is rather Cool.	Slick and efficient, with little if any narrative flab.	... workmanlike heist flick with some funny lines and some good (if brief) chases ...	Despite some iffy plot elements, The Italian Job succeeds in delivering an entertaining modern take on the original 1969 heist film, thanks to a charismatic cast.
While rather preposterously hypocritical in its moral pretensions, it nevertheless comes through in the no-holds-barred, body-slam department.	Smarter-than-average action movie.	Attacking the intended audience is one of those things that a filmmaker just doesn't do. Jeez!	There are some nicely over-the-top moments in this Battle Royale/Running Man puree -- most involving people plummeting and blowing up. But the misogyny and choppy action edits spoil the fun.	Despite a slick production and good actors, The Condemned is a real stinker.	The Condemned is a morally ambiguous, exceedingly violent and mostly forgettable action film.
Starts off as a good example of super-glitz moviemaking, gradually turns into a movie on fire -- another helter-skelter, big-studio spending spree.	Director Tony Scott's visual style is very jittery and more expressionistic than it needs to be, but he succeeds in creating an appropriately nightmarish, apocalyptic vision of the Third World south of the border.	An over-big, over-loud, over-heated, over-long, over-everything mess of a story about this year's most popular movie topic, revenge.	Moviegoers have a duty to admonish Hollywood for turning the multiplex into a Two Hours Hate, asking us to cheer the fascist aesthetic of movies like Man of Fire.	This is a dark but wonderfully created picture of friendship and love.	Man on Fire starts out well, but goes over the top in the violent second half.
Be prepared to be completely bowled over by a director at the peak of his talents and in full control of top-notch material.	Arguably Scorsese's finest hour.	One of the most perfect movies ever made.	Director Scorsese does an impeccable job of covering all the ground here in a 21/2-hour film that doesn't seem long at all.	Scorsese brilliantly juxtaposes scenes of family greatness with those of bleak criminal action. The performances are superb examples of action, delivery, and nuance.	Hard-hitting and stylish, GoodFellas is a gangster classic -- and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career.
It's quiet, small and emotional in its approach to the problems - both large and small - shared between four friends.	A mysandristic chick flick in the worst sense of the word.	Further testament to Holofcener's skill and ongoing development as one of her generation's most consistently interesting independent filmmakers.	Promises to say more, but never goes further than giving us small observations of modern urban life.	These are people not so different from those you know or perhaps even are, ever so slightly inflated, all the better to gently puncture.	Stong lead performances, witty dialogue and wry observations cement Friends With Money as another winning dramedy from writer/director Nicole Holofcener.
A uniquely intriguing motion picture.	Haunting, sensual, allusive.	if you sit through this, it should serve as enough suffering to remit all of the temporal punishment for your sins so you can go directly to heaven when you expire.	A stunning piece of dramatic filmmaking, a completely original approach to the material that delivers a delayed punch as the evidence accrues	After a while, the film casts its spell.	This provocative, lyrical drama mixes themes of forbidden sexuality and redemptive faith with a touch of humanism in a memorable, if disorienting, visual style.
it's when 'Baby' sheds the gloves that the drama truly takes off. And take off it does, in an utterly unexpected direction that's certain to startle...	The film belongs to Swank.	Saying this movie is about boxing is akin to saying Citizen Kane is about a sled.	...doesn't focus on the superficial elements of machismo, but rather on the nature of what being a man really means	At 74 and directing his 25th film, (Clint) Eastwood just keeps getting better behind the camera.	Clint Eastwood's assured direction - combined with knockout performances from Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman - help Million Dollar Baby to transcend its clichés, and the result is deeply heartfelt and moving.
Rarely does a film cause those visceral adrenaline rushes of recognizing greatness, but "The Secret Lives of Dentists" brings waves of them.	[Campbell Scott gives] a brilliant performance, with hints of humor, rage and agony all lurking around the edges.	It's funny, honest enough to make you squirm and a film that may make you feel a little bit of the pain on the other side of that shrieking drill.	A cross between 'Eyes Wide Shut' and 'A Beautiful Mind' -- but more compelling than either.	Unlike the majority of movies in which a thousand digital extras are sacrificed upon the altar of commercial catharsis, The Secret Lives of Dentists gives the impression of acknowledging the existence of garden-variety human suffering.	A witty and honest look at marriage in decay.
Why did they make it so muddled?	I wonder why a movie that is about a terrible guy would spend so much energy on vilifying the women he was terrible to.	Once heard, the song can never be forgotten!	A cop-out!	Lymon's short career paved the way for musical figures like Ross and Michael Jackson, but unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't always give you the biopic you deserve.	This is a fun comedy with delightful musical numbers.
Shortland well deserves the awards already lavished on her back home in Australia.	Absorbing and brave filmmaking.	Cornish is a marvel...	This is an honest movie that should, but probably won't, be seen by the tweenie crowd.	... says more about the potent mix of restless sexuality and troubled adolescence than a shelf-full of young adult novels.	A poignant coming-of-age tale marked by a breakout lead performance from Abbie Cornish and a successful directorial debut from Cate Shortland.
[An] enjoyable movie experience.	A thoroughly watchable action movie with several fright-inducing scenes, a good deal of black humor, and some notable underlying themes that never quite congeal.	A two-hour collection of jokes, stunts, chases and bloodlettings in search of a story or at least one compelling character.	Creative cinematography and non-stop, decently choreographed gratuitous violence make watching this comic-book movie entertaining. In fact, it's arguably the best comic-book movie of the year.	By the time the movie was over, I was in awe over the visionary success that I had just scene.	Though some may find the plot a bit lacking, Blade's action is fierce, plentiful, and appropriately stylish for a comic book adaptation.
a fragile premise stuffed with hollow Christmas jokes	Re-teaming with Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin, Vince Vaughn plays the eponymous character, Santa's crankier and considerably less charitable older brother, while doing all the riffing his PG straitjacket will allow.	The burden of having a famous sibling seems fraught with comedic possibilities, but whatever potential existed has been squandered and then some in Fred Claus, dumping coal into everyone's holiday stocking.	The cast boasts three Oscar winners and two nominees. Normally, such a pedigree would guarantee great performances, at the very least.	Paul Giamatti is forced to play Santa like a socially awkward version of Vince Vaughn	A slew of talent is wasted in this contrived and overly sentimental Christmas film, which can't quite get the balance between slapstick humor and sentimental family moments.
The film itself is a little too rough around the edges to fully engage. Fascinating subject, though.	It's the rare film that gets deep into low income inner city life and zeroes in on what motivates those whom society tends to forget.	An urban Western with ball caps and bikes in place of cowboy hats and horses.	Vibrantly filmed documentary about a young boy trying to fit in with notorious Baltimore dirt-bike riders fairly throbs with pent-up passions, but runs out of story fast.	With so many advocacy documentaries on screens of late, Nathan's unwillingness to take a side is refreshing.	Visually striking and grippingly fast-paced, 12 O'Clock Boys asks thought-provoking questions with admirable subtlety and restraint.
Hilarious, inventive documentary.	With complex lead characters, an endless supporting cast and focus on an inanimate object that draws out the weakness in men, the movie has more in common with the Lord of the Rings trilogies than anything from the camera of Ken Burns.	Sometimes the most fascinating stories come from the most trivial of places, and this lesson is perpetually evident throughout the addictively entertaining Up For Grabs	This smartly assembled comedy articulates irritation with and bewilderment at its subject: the legal battle for possession of a baseball.	A mockumentary with real people.	You don't have to be a baseball fan to be entertained by the absurdities, obsessions, and greed on display in this documentary.
... Superman Returns brings a richer, grander perspective to a seminal character without changing his essence.	World-saving, all-powerful, hero-to-everyone stuff must be lonely work, and Singer's Superman bears the responsibility with the slightly clenched dutifulness of someone who's immortal enough to accept his destiny but human enough to suffer the weight.	...the most effective and flat-out entertaining installment in this ongoing series.	Logical progression, intelligent reappraisal, and nostalgia trip all in one, Superman Return is better than we dared hope.	Bryan blends his beautiful vision with an elegant, intimate story and the result is a work of real art.	Bryan Singer's reverent and visually decadent adaptation gives the Man of Steel welcome emotional complexity. The result: a satisfying stick-to-your-ribs adaptation.
A dull, plodding, overly long drama that goes nowhere (unless around in circles counts as somewhere)	Rich in thoughtful ideas, but disappointingly uneven in dramatic power	Another utterly captivating John Sayles ensemble piece with an incredible sense of a particular place and its personality.	...Sayles repeats his formula in a faded Florida beach town with distinctly lesser returns	Leave it to John Sayles to take on developers, the Chamber of Commerce, tourism, historical pageants, and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute.	Wonderfully acted, but the story and pacing can use a little work.
While certainly not for all viewers, and even if it takes a bit to gain viewer engagement and traction, the film turns out to be, pardon the obligatory pun, fairly bloody fun.	The most obvious reference point for 2007 Best Picture nominee Sweeney Todd is Baz Luhrmann's equally fluid 2001 Best Picture nominee Moulin Rouge!	As much as he's a filmmaker, Burton is also a graphic artist in the tradition of Charles Addams and Edward Gorey -- and here he's successfully incorporated Sweeney Todd into his own distinctively dank and spidery gothic world.	Looks incredible, like a moving painting, but it's absolutely mediocre...	Mesmerizing and highly entertaining.	Full of pith and Grand Guignol grossness, this macabre musical is perfectly helmed and highly entertaining. Tim Burton masterfully stages the musical in a way that will make you think he has done this many times before.
A work of both learned, assured poise and triumphant freshman determination, not far away from other benchmark-status works like Snow White or Pixar's Toy Story.	All charmingness aside, this cute but rather thinly plotted yarn exposes the cracks that were present in the pre-renaissance Disney empire.	Accomplished and sometimes exciting ... but by and large unsatisfying.	The Fox and the Hound is a flawed, but effective kids' flick.	The bottom line, I suppose, is: Will kids like this movie? And the answer is, sure, I think so.	The Fox and the Hound is a likeable, charming, unassuming effort that manages to transcend its thin, predictable plot.
What makes this film so worthy is the understanding it gives us both of the wolf in sheep's clothing and of the betrayal of trust.	One of the best and most important documentaries you'll ever see.	Even people who reject the idea of inherent evil may be shaken by Berg's scrupulous yet passionate recounting of the story of Oliver O'Grady.	Works best when it concentrates on O'Grady and the ever-rippling effect of his transgressions.	The wrenching documentary Deliver Us From Evil explores the mind of a pedophile as it accuses the Catholic Church of failing to protect children.	Deliver Us From Evil is a superb documentary and a searing look at an institution protecting its leaders at the expense of its followers. A profoundly disturbing chronicle of a wolf in sheep's clothing, the film builds a clear-eyed case against pedophile priest Oliver O'Grady, and the Catholic bureaucracy that protected him. The recollections of O'Grady's victims are nothing short of shocking and heartbreaking.
It is nice just to sit back and let the day-glo colours wash over you, marvelling at the high-spirited energy.	Wonderfully shot in an oh-so-bright colour scheme and laced with a delightful sense of humour, the tale of gunslinger Dum and his childhood sweetheart Rumpoey is a joy.	It's got a weird charm, but it needs a loudly enthusiastic audience to keep it galloping along.	An enjoyably energetic genre romp.	What the story lacks in snap, it makes up for in sincerity. [The film's] melodrama is so poker-faced and its gore so explicit (if phony-looking) that it's hard to tell whether you're dealing with the Thai Todd Haynes or the Thai Sam Peckinpah.	With a vibrant pastel color scheme and stylized action sequences, Tears of the Black Tiger is a bizarre, yet thoroughly entertaining Thai western.
The film clearly - and repeatedly - hammers home the point that in our culture, any viewpoint can be defended with the right tactics, regardless of truth or ethics.	It's filled with nice little moments of trenchant drollery, kind of like a really good political humor blog.	A comedy likely to delight both mainstream and art-house audiences.	Wryly irreverent, this cynical comedy about a tobacco lobbyist is a merciless smoke screen.	...indulges in the sort of relentless cynicism that is only born of defeat.	Loaded with delightfully unscrupulous characters and and a witty, cynical script, Thank You For Smoking is a sharp satire with a brilliantly smarmy lead performance from Aaron Eckhart.
If you have a 10-year-old desperate to see a movie this weekend, you might do worse.	remains reasonably pleasant, since Holmes turns Sam into something more than the run-of-the-mill poor little rich girl.	All of this is obviously completely predictable and you keep waiting for something unexpected to happen. You're still waiting when the film ends.	First Daughter is just one more in the plague of weak Cinderella stories released in the past year.	A dull one for director Forest Whitaker.	First Daughter is a bland and charmless fairy tale that fails to rise above the formula.
If, like me, you find that the decision to be made here has an obvious solution, [it] takes it time arriving at it. But it is the way in which Ryota comes to understand the way fathers shape their sons that makes "Like Father, Like Son" worthwhile.	An appealing Japanese film about the slow and surprising transformation of a self-absorbed father and distant father.	Like Father Like Son plays out as a gentle, cautionary morality tale for our times, which might be its weakness.	Its children-switched-at-birth story sounds schematic, but what we see on screen is both meaningful and deeply moving.	The children's performances are winning, but the director's dogmatic social scheme saps the dramatic tension in a film whose predictable message is: to be like a real father, you must connect with your son.	Sensitively written, smartly directed, and powerfully performed, Like Father, Like Son uses familiar-seeming elements to tell a thought-provoking story.
The characters briefly mention problems an interracial couple still face today, but that's as far as it goes.	A film that could have wryly dealt with matters of race, or simply could have been funnier, had it possessed a clearer template than a star pairing and a truncated title.	It's been a long time since the words 'Ashton Kutcher' and 'hilarious' have appeared in the same sentence, but they'll have to get reacquainted. Kutcher and costar Bernie Mac make a terrific comic team.	It's not an unpleasant movie, just a confused, sometimes frustrating one.	It says something about the timidity of the corporate-dominated entertainment industry that a contemporary film lacks the audacity of a 30-year-old sitcom.	Despite the chemistry of its stars, Guess Who, a loose remake of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, lacks the political relevance of the original.
What I miss most of all is the absence of the late, great Mel Blanc.	No matter if you're a basketball fan, a cartoon fan, or a movie fan, Space Jam offers little that will excite you or involve you. You'd get more excitement watching a local pick-up game.	First-rate popcorn movie: undemanding, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.	This movie has all the wit of the original Warner Brothers Cartoons, and a few updated jabs at modern society.	Sufferin' succotash!	A harmless mishmash of basketball and animation that'll entertain kids but leave adults less than thrilled.
Enhancing the film with special effects and a clearer presentation, Lucas has turned something that was relatively unwatchable into something that can endure as a sci-fi classic.	This new, highly polished upgrade is a nice gift for science fiction fans.	Meditative and downbeat rather than crowd-pleasing, the film includes a few sequences that suggest the direction Lucas career later took.	[Lucas' 1970 debut] not only gives obvious indications of his glittering future career but also works in its own right as a terrific bit of sci-fi entertainment, creating a palpable sense of tension in its view of s futuristic dystopia.	Meditative and downbeat rather than crowd-pleasing.	George Lucas' feature debut presents a spare, bleak, dystopian future, and features evocatively minimal set design and creepy sound effects.
...ultimately fares worse than its eye-rollingly campy 1994 predecessor...	I much prefer the flamboyant badness of the '94 flick to the attractive, even-keeled mediocrity of this one. Jean-Claude Van Damme's stock just rose considerably.	Singularly witless.	if there's anything legendary on display, it's the performance of co-star Chris Klein, which can only be described as epic in its awfulness.	Just a boring, bad action movie - which, to be fair, means that it's one of the best video game adaptations ever made.	The combination of a shallow plot and miscast performers renders Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li a perfectly forgettable video game adaptation.
May be a so-called 'feel-good' comedy-drama, but it is rarely funny, and its emotions neglect to exude much tangible feeling.	Mostly, though, this is a cookie-cutter drama.	AA Lite.	Un mensaje que por momentos quiere ser profundo y reflexivo pero que, desafortunadamente, se queda en el intento	Gwen lands in Serenity Glen, where recovering addicts sing "Happy Trails To You" in between participating in the cutest group therapy sessions you've ever seen. This might be where the Care Bears go for help if they fall off the wagon.	Even though 28 Days is tackling a difficult subject, it comes off light and superficial, and maybe even a little preachy.
Hardwicke shows great instincts, using a frenetic documentary style to hammer home the brutal realities of modern teenage life, but rooting it in an unusually sensitive portrait of mother and daughter.	. . .no adult, and certainly no parent, should have to endure the attention-grabbing temper tantrum that is Thirteen.	Thirteen, a disturbing look at rebellious teens, is galvanized by emotional extremes and wrenching performances. But this gritty indie film also presumes a profundity that its edgy shocks and drama-queen histrionics don't deliver.	Girls just wanna have fun in "Thirteen," an uncompromising look at a young girl's descent into troubled teendom.	Dramatic without being totally original, [and] shocking without being too provocative.	An emotionally wrenching, not to mention terrifying, film about the perils of being a teenager.
...Wiseman's film is the most nourishing example of cinematic brain food you'll have all year.	An intriguing and valuable record.	[The film invites] you to consider not only the many efforts to situate art but also how art might elude definition, and how people's stories about art can be awkward and self-regarding, however earnest and insistent.	The trick with this kind of subtle, fly-on-the-wall film-making is gradually to change our preconceptions about the subject.	A mesmerising look at the great gallery at work.	National Gallery finds director Frederick Wiseman doing what he does best: Drawing the viewer in with richly detailed, patiently constructed observations on modern institutions.
Boy, you know, I really like the Chiodo Brothers' Killer Klowns from Outer Space. I can't help it.	IT'S GOT CLOWNS! FROM OUTER SPACE! AND THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE! What's not to like?	The name says it all, and the movie delivers.	Yes, it's goofy but the klowns really are killer.	Chiodo takes an alien invasion plot familiar from the 50s, and makes it all his own by rigorously and liberally painting it with every clown reference imaginable.	Killer Klowns from Outer Space's title promises darkly goofy fun -- and more often than not, the movie delivers.
Witherspoon and Vaughn play two characters who are totally unlikeable, and the movie as a whole is too.	It certainly won't be your favorite present under the tree this Christmas, but it should provide just the diversion you're looking for.	...generally comes off as an interminable would-be comedy that'll leave most viewers feeling like the Grinch.	Seems intent on being as generic and lowbrow as possible, with broad slapstick emphasized over witty dialogue or interesting characters.	But as syrup and cynicism congeal into one painful clot, there is never any doubt that this is a major studio's crack at the Yuletide market.	Despite a strong cast, this sour holiday comedy suffers from a hackneyed script.
An extremely simple-minded present-day chase movie...blown to smithereens by plot holes the size of the majestic mountain canyons where some of the action is set.	"What about intel?" someone asks. "We don't need it--we have HIM." You don't need to be Cage to forsee we're in for a lot of bang bang and the obligatory shooting of the black secondary character is moments away.	Half of Next is a clever, unpredictable thriller... the other half is a sloppy, bloated adventure marred by cheesy special effects and some equally cheesy acting.	Tired of really bad action movies starring Nicolas Cage? Sigh. So are we.	Straddles a fence between adequately clever and surprisingly stupid ... but most of it is still fun anyway.	Numerous plot holes and poorly motivated characters prevent Next from being the thought-provoking sci-fi flick it could've been.
One giant mess.	If it sounds like a bad idea, you don't know the half of it.	I will tell you there's a cast credit for a character described only as "Butt-crack man." Consider yourself warned.	Surprisingly not all that painful, but don't fall for the 3D scam.	Black was already the world's biggest little kid, and he might be the only actor who could have made this movie such nimble fun. No matter how thin the concept, Black always manages to make it his own.	Though Jack Black is back doing what he does best, Gulliver's Travels largely fails to do any justice to its source material, relying instead on juvenile humor and special effects.
Depp's decision to play Wonka as a children's-show host (like Captain Kangaroo or Mr. Green Jeans) merged with the visage of Vogue editor Anna Wintour (though I'd say he looks more like Faye Dunaway by way of Michael Jackson) is one of his rare missteps.	A winning, charming, very droll children's film for the whole family.	Burton's movie is not only more faithful, complex and better cast, it has an essential ingredient: squirrels.	Fun and creepy.	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an inspired and hugely satisfying meeting of director and material.	Closer to the source material than 1971's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is for people who like their Chocolate visually appealing and dark.
The film is very funny when broken into individual scenes, but it takes too many easy potshots at low targets and thereby fails to come together as an emotional whole.	It's sweet and superficial, but the meandering pace and lively characters make it just about watchable.	...takes the boorishness of conventional Americans as a given and valorizes nonconformity for its own sake.	Away We Go is a big success.	Away We Go is like a disappointing term paper by a promising student.	Built on a set of quirks and charms that are as noticeable as they are interchangeable, Away We Go is a sweet but uneven road trip.
Spike Lee goes from inspired gutsiness to pretentious gooeyness, as if Eminem turned into Alan Jackson.	Sorrowful and thoughtful at the same time, 25th Hour is about how a single situation can jolt us out of our comfortable complacency and threaten us with the harsh fact that nothing will ever be the same again.	A tour de force of ensemble acting, "25th Hour" explores the responsibilities of relationships.	The ensemble is solid, and Norton plays the gruff guy well, so you want to care about his predicament.	A moving tribute to resilience in the face of ruination.	An intelligent and well-acted film despite the usual Spike Lee excesses.
Anderson prizes the funny over the profound to an extent that keeps the proceedings a tad too light and jovial to register as anything more than a lightweight aside to his more acute, earnest work.	This likable lark functions as a reprieve from the plasticity of most modern toon flicks.	Anderson's films often bounce between absurd comedy and poignant catharsis, and Mr. Fox is no different. Its brisk pacing keeps the catharsis from weighing down the comedy.	Life is full of surprises. The best one I've had in a good while is Fantastic Mr. Fox.	Fantastic Mr. Fox isn't exactly a kids' movie. It's just kid-friendly.	Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightfully funny feast for the eyes with multi-generational appeal -- and it shows Wes Anderson has a knack for animation.
An artsy slasher film that makes good use of its large budget for costumes, production design, and surgically graphic corpses	A beautiful looking disappointment.	Apart from its brilliant surface, 'From Hell' is so ordinary a treatment of the Ripper story that it seems utterly superfluous.	I know it's a cheap shot to say that the title is an apt description, but ... There, I did it anyway.	Loaded with appealing gothic style and dread-laden atmosphere, but the story is incredibly dull.	Visually impressive, but this latest Ripper tale is dull and far from scary.
Visually stimulating but intellectually mediocre.	It's the harsher images that stick in our minds, because Scorsese makes us feel like we're seeing them first-hand.	The film's postcards from the edge will burn into your consciousness.	A harrowing, darkly comic tale.	I congratulate Martin Scorsese on this miraculous triumph over his personal demons, and pray for the swift recovery of his art.	Stunning and compelling, Scorsese and Cage succeed at satisfying the audience.
'Titanic' went down to the tune of $600 million, so it's no surprise that 'Poseidon' is now rising from the depths. Action-packed yet thematically barren, it will rivet audiences, if only momentarily.	It's possible to enjoy Poseidon if you're seeing it simply for the visual effects and high-energy action. On that action-movie level, at least, Poseidon stays afloat.	you start to realize that the capsized cruise liner onscreen isn't the only sinking ship.	A disaster film that goes blub blub in the night.	We get a parade of ciphers so thinly scripted that it's impossible to work up much anxiety about what happens to them.	This remake of The Poseidon Adventure delivers dazzling special effects. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that any of the budget was left over to devote to the script.
Wow----- who needs horror flicks?? 'The 11th Hour' is scarier than anything I've seen in the theater in a long time.	Persuasively damning... some might say these ideas are still being exhaustively (though inexplicably) debated as a political issue, but perhaps the film's greatest strength is in making its hysterical, activism-now urgencies an emotional issue.	The shadowy photography of the interviewees lends an ominous tone to nearly every scene, but what they're saying is often pragmatic and helpful.	Among recent documentaries questioning the status quo, The 11th Hour takes the most far-reaching point of view and connects issues into larger patterns, culminating in a truly global call for change.	Takes a doom and gloom approach to the earth's current plight, but also offers a ray of hope and intelligent solutions for making a change.	Well-researched and swimming in scientific data, this global warming documentary offers some practical and wide-ranging solutions to our climate crisis.
I wish Windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story. This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted, and there still could have been room for the war scenes.	Woo wanted the film to be realistic, and it is. The violence is unrelenting, the uniforms are dirty and mismatched, the weapons are shiny from use, the soldiers are exhausted, sick, sad.	It's like the first 25 minutes of Saving Private Ryan stretched over two hours. I liked it a lot, but the weak and the skittish are hereby warned.	Woo, the modern master of action violence, gives the battle scenes the explosive intensity you'd expect.	Windtalkers' remains almost obstinately flat.	The action sequences are expertly staged. Windtalkers, however, sinks under too many clichés and only superficially touches upon the story of the code talkers.
Burton's modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts.	An original movie, though not Tim Burton's best.	Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin.	... this sweet 1990 fantasy ... for the first time crystallized the latent themes in the director's work: the notion of the artist as outsider, of skills that make one special but at the same time different.	His gothic tones always mask a feeling of wonder and an endearing love for everything that is possible in life and death	The first collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands is a magical modern fairy tale with gothic overtones and a sweet center.
A furiously paced and fantastically fierce series of tornadoes, each one more intense and more amazing than the last, offer enough exhaustion and thrills for even the most jaded moviegoer.	Ugh. Not even a passable popcorn pic, I'm afraid.	Whatever one might think of the increasing mindlessness of effects-driven blockbusters, you'd think they could at least manage to entertain, or to give you a reason to come back when you get up to go to the restroom.	Cheguei ŕ conclusăo, depois de assistir a este filme, que paguei o ingresso para ver uma vaca voando e o trailer de 'Missăo: Impossível'.	It looks real, and Director Jan De Bont keeps the action coming so fast there's no time to question it.	A high-concept blockbuster that emphasizes special effects over three-dimensional characters, Twister's visceral thrills are often offset by the film's generic plot.
This is the best movie so far this year [and] I think it's the most important film.	Be prepared. United 93 is overwhelming, telling a story we've all come to know so very well. It will be one of the most affecting movies you'll ever see--if you can bring yourself to see it, that is.	Un tenso y atrapante relato que imagina, con un realismo casi documental, lo que pudo haber sucedido a bordo del fatídico vuelo.	For me, Paul Greengrass' meticulously researched movie was a deeply cathartic experience.	Above all, one truth remains: the sacrifice of the 40 passengers on Flight 93 is truly remarkable. The film portrays their courage in the face of staggering odds in its own subjective and respectful way. It achieves what it wants as a film.	Potent and sobering, United 93 is even more gut-wrenching because the outcome is already known. While difficult to watch, director Paul Greengrass' film has been made with skill and treats the subject matter with respect, never resorting to the aggrandizement of which Hollywood has sometimes been accused. Especially effective is the cast of mostly unknown actors, who portray the passengers of the doomed flight as ordinary people who respond with bravery to extraordinary circumstances.
One of the best Shakespearean film adaptations out there.	Throne of Blood spectacularly transforms the source play -- turning it into a terrifying journey through darkness, evil, and despair.	Kurosawa at the top of his game, Mifune at his most darkly compelling, and the best realization of Shakespeare ever put to film.	Genius. No, really: Genius. Obviously.	This is filmmaking with risk and greatness in its blood.	A career high point for Akira Kurosawa -- and one of the best film adaptations of a Shakespeare play.
A rarity: a thoughtful, surprising film wholly within the martial arts genre.	If Unleashed is morally and narratively direct, its execution is all over the place.	This is by far Jet Li's best English language film, and one of the finest of his career, not because of the thrillingly choreographed fight sequences but because of its well constructed story and Li's riveting performance.	The most interesting English-language film [Li] has made yet -- an action picture with the emotional simplicity of a bedtime story, painted in the grimy colors of the London underworld.	Unleashed is one of those rare gems, a date movie with exploding squibs.	Jet Li gets to emote in some emotionally awkward scenes, but the gritty fight sequences come through in what is Li's best English language film.
The clever but confused "Safety Not Guaranteed" is loosely inspired by a classified ad, ostensibly seeking a partner for a trip back in time, which became a minor Internet sensation a few years back.	Quirky sci-fi comedy wears its heart on its sleeve as it plays tricks with time.	More focused on emotion than adventure, it teases out the possibilities and perils of time travel without embroiling itself in the confusion inherent to the subject.	A small, richly nuanced, engaging piece of romantic fluff with a decent sci-fi tinge that doesn't overplay its quirkiness.	his time-travel romcom wastes lead Aubrey Plaza and dithers until its geek-pandering finale.	Safety Not Guaranteed's ostensibly modest ambitions are outmatched by the movie's strong performances, beguiling charm, and heartfelt story.
This passionate faith-based movie offers moral encouragement and gives people an altruistic goal worth achieving. It deserves to be ranked alongside similar message-driven movies as "Facing the Giants" and "Fireproof."	A series of hard-to-swallow coincidences wrap up the story too neatly.	As stiff as it is sincere.	Movie goers likely will look over The Grace Card's entertainment value to focus on this simple prescription for how to gracefully love your neighbor.	The film is powerful when operating on the personal level of two men working out faith, but disappointing that their story is buried in a heavy-handed, manipulative plot.	Tailored for a very specific audience, The Grace Card delivers its noble religious message via implausible plot twists and preachy dialogue.
Bonnie and Clyde (1967) is one of the sixties' most talked-about, controversial crime/gangster films combining comedy, terror, love, and ferocious violence	It is a film that took considerable risks, but somehow or another, all the gears clicked at the right time, and director Arthur Penn wound up with a national masterpiece he was never able to equal.	Arguably the most influential (but not best) film of the late 60s, Arthur Penn's saga changed the course of American cinema, particularly in the controversial areas of sex and violence and the link between them.	This film is worthy of the attention of anyone who's interested in classic American cinema.	Considered New Hollywood's moment of arrival, tipping square critic Bosley Crowther into retirement (The New York Times, they were a-changin').	A paradigm-shifting classic of American cinema, Bonnie and Clyde packs a punch whose power continues to reverberate through thrillers decades later.
A striking addition to the Shakespeare filmography.	It's all plot twists and shock tactics, without the poetry and resonance of Shakespeare's later work.	At once mesmerizing and jarring to the point that the audience can never get comfortable in the film.	The real star of the show is Lange.	Tecnicamente brilhante, esta inventiva adaptaусo traz зtimas atuaушes - com exceусo de Cumming, que parece estar ensaiando para um revival de Rocky Horror Picture Show.	The movie stretches too long to be entertaining despite a strong cast.
None of them can act worth a lick, but all of them would be perfect for an Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue.	The Covenant has excellent special effects (spiders and specters, oh my!), but it is strikingly lacking in suspense.	[An] eardrum-punishing, uninspired composite of X-Men and the Harry Potter series ...	Anyone with half a brain is not this movie's target audience.	... as chilling as a steam shower.	The Covenant plays out like a teen soap opera, full of pretty faces, wooden acting, laughable dialogue, and little suspense.
Sleep furiously is a film whose lower-case title is in perfect keeping with the understated but tremulous mood it manages, with rare skill, to create and to maintain.	The film has richness and an unshowy compassion, its grammar and pace adjusting to the tempo of the countryside.	Delicate, dignified but also undeniably dull, Sleep Furiously captures perhaps all too well the slow rhythms of a disappearing idyll.	Koppel's film transcends the pedagogic to touch the celebratory, the holistic, the mystical.	This is as fully formed and unique a debut movie as you could ever hope to see.	This poetic and tender portrait of a Welsh village is a slow moving yet elegantly accomplished British documentary.
As a sports movie the film perhaps lacks the pace and punch to capture the genre's traditional audience. But Sugar is much more than a sports movie. It is a picture of integrity, intelligence and empathy that studiously avoids cliché.	A portrait of an immigrant, a sports movie commentating on the machinations of American sport and a coming-of-age drama: Sugar is not short of subject matter.	Sugar, winningly played by the complete newcomer Soto, isn't a cut-out ingenu but a testy, competitive, driven but fallible person. The road he follows is modest, but the film is beautiful and searching in letting him find it for himself.	Sugar is a completely convincing character who inhabits what appears to be an utterly authentic world.	Steroids enter the equation, but "Sugar's" narrative turns feel more generous than obvious - emphasizing baseball's calming, community ideas over its cult of personality. The gravity of Miguel's plight stays with you, but so does his eventual peace.	Sugar is an exceptionally-crafted film -- part sports flick, part immigrant tale -- with touching and poignant drama highlighted by splendid performances.
This is Hollywood high art: it has all the spectacular special effects and awesome stunts that only tinsel town infrastructure (i.e. big bucks) can produce and nobody else.	Set the standard for modern Hollywood's F/X-driven mega-productions and cemented James Cameron's dystopian vision as modern science-fiction's saga par excellence.	As appealing as the film's visuals are, it's really the heart and soul of the characters that make T2 transcend the summer sequel dumping ground.	Brutally beautiful, darkly comic sci-fi	Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style.	T2 features thrilling action sequences and eye-popping visual effects, but what takes this sci-fi/ action landmark to the next level is the depth of the human (and cyborg) characters.
Like its predecessor, Bears can be funny in a snide sort of way, but it doesn't have much kick.	Bad news.	There is nothing wrong per se with this new version of The Bad News Bears. That said, the new version lacks the bite of what we saw in the mid-70's.	These Bad News Bears are just about as entertaining as the Seventies version.	young teenagers might enjoy the mildly bad attitude and silly sequences, but adults will be bored	This too-faithful remake aims low for laughs, turning off the easily offendable; despite another lovably irascible contribution by Thornton, it lacks the ensemble strength and originality of the 1976 version.
Perhaps Waters' best known movie.	Waters' most hygienically commercial film is a Retro schlock-fancier's delight.	One of the great films of the '80s and as close to perfect as Waters has gotten	A kitschy teen fantasy you can dance to.	Hairspray represents more-mainstream John Waters fare, but the inspired casting itself will warrant a look for this 1988 film.	Hairspray is perhaps John Waters' most accessible film, and as such, it's a gently subversive slice of retro hilarity.
A hard-hitting documentary in which the men of rival Irish traveler clans periodically beat each other to a pulp to settle a family feud that began for a reason that nobody remembers. Bloody amazing!	Knuckle is a curiously riveting work.	Knuckle offers an intimate look at a largely unfamiliar culture that is fascinating even if you have no interest in boxing	Simply showing generations of pasty, fat men pounding each other to a pulp shouldn't be mistaken for an in-depth exploration of Gaelic machismo...	Though you will wish for more polish and insight, its unruly action is hard to resist.	A gritty documentary that captures the brutality and banality of bare-knuckle fights among Irish Travellers.
A touching story built on conflict: emotional, cultural and physical.	Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland's ambitious but bleak social problem film is compelling but never fully satisfies in its clumsy dramatics.	A subtle yet powerful movie about a journey outward and inward.	Immigration to America as a theme has been done, but 'The Beautiful Country' puts a fresh face on the topic.	Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland, possibly sacrificing any hope for financial success, ensures that the film proceeds proportional to the speed of a real-life journey.	The plight of Asian refugees is sensitively rendered, and the movie builds, with the help of Nolte, to a wrenchingly poignant conclusion.
As with most Mamet scripts, this includes multiple monologues, and the cast delivers them with fervor. But the delivery can't conceal that these diatribes are directed at topics that no longer are pertinent.	There is no question about the inspired tragedy and incinerating fury of Mr. Macy's bravura center-ring performance.	Fails to offer any insight into its main character's motivations.	After a while, I simply couldn't empathize with Edmond and all his pain and suffering, and certainly not with all his exposed bigotries and delusions.	By design, nasty, brutish, and short...functions as drama because shock crosses through sensationalism to a kind of purity in the character study of a man in desperate need of repair.	Despite an electrifying performance by William H. Macy, David Mamet's one-act morality play translates poorly into a film that is overburdened by dialogue.
... can't decide whether to poke fun at these characters for their ridiculous stunt or to play it straight, and they get caught in the middle without any real payoff either way.	A match-up that comes about three decades late.	It's not a travesty but it lacks suspense. You don't care who wins, perhaps because neither Stallone nor DeNiro wanted to play the bad guy.	'Grudge Match' is just about what you'd expect: an average movie that's an excuse to pair Sylvester Stallone with Robert De Niro in a sort of 'Rocky vs. Raging Bull' picture.	This is the long way around to saying that the ludicrous Grudge Match turns out to much better than anyone might have expected.	Grudge Match is sporadically funny but meandering, and its strong cast largely mired in a plot that's overrun with clichés.
an utterly disposable, yet thoroughly charming piece of bubblegum pop aimed squarely at pre-teen girls	Because it doesn't take itself too seriously, Aquamarine actually demands your attention.	Aquamarine rises above the flotsam filling theaters this time of year with a likable tale of friendship and charming performances.	A filmy pool of tropes and tchotchkes stereotypically associated with Girls of Today.	Kids seem to love the recognizable 'tween stars, but for the rest of us it's sort of like the cotton-candy scene%u2014we're not sure whether to eat it or rub our faces in it.	A lighthearted, gum-smacking, boy-crazy film with a hopeful message for young girls.
a step above the pitfalls hampering it	... a wild thing that sticks with you long after it's over.	It spins out of control despite the best efforts of Norton.	Dealing with the old Western myth in a suburbanized setting (tract houses chew up the land that Harlan lays claim to romantically), Jacobson has bitten off more than even a proven master could chew and swallow.	In the end, the core idea is weighted down by too much length, strained sympathy, and a conclusion that comes with more relief than satisfaction.	The premise of Old West clashing with modern suburbia is fresh and initially intriguing, but the second act degenerates into a clumsy jumble of events which strain credibility.
A raw and unforgettable portrait of need and sexual repression.	Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances.	An unflinching view into sexual sadism, starkly contrasted against a background of Rachmaninov, Schubert and Bach.	A film of Artaudian cruelty, and a boundary-breaker in the cinema's exploration of its own erotic and artisanal id.	At once difficult to watch and impossible to ignore, a brilliant and uncompromising portrait of a character both loathsome and pathetic.	Though it makes for rather unpleasant viewing, The Piano Teacher is a riveting and powerful psychosexual drama.
The cast of non professional singers, epitomized by the mediocre talents of Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried, disrespects ABBA's melodic 1970's music. What a shame.	While it'd be embellishment to say you'd have the time of your life, any dancing queen or an admirer of seeing Pierce Brosnan croon a tune instead of trigger James Bond destruction can at least have some of the time of your 108 minutes.	Maybe watching three older women prancing around in tight spandex singing ABBA is someone's idea of a good time, but I wouldn't want to be stuck in a room with those people for more than 90 minutes ever again.	Before plunking down your cash for a ride on the Mamma Mia! express when it pulls into town, just ask yourself one question: Do I really dig ABBA?	A collection of droopy ditties draped around a threadbare plot.	This jukebox musical is full of fluffy fun but rough singing voices and a campy tone might not make you feel like "You Can Dance" the whole 90 minutes.
It sounds heavygoing but if anything Amreeka is a little too sweet and cosy for its own good.	Writer director Cherien Dabis writes about what she knows about being a stranger in a new land: the difficulties, the isolation, the conflicts, the misunderstandings. The result is a heartfelt and engaging film	The good humor, generosity, and love Dabis bestows on her characters in this assured first feature are uniquely hers -- the mark of a talent to watch	This sensitively made movie is more than dim Americans making terrorist jokes. It's one of the richer movies you're likely to see about average Arabs in America.	Dabis wisely keeps her film firmly grounded in the personal and specific...focusing on the experiences of one family which she makes us care about.	A dramedy that's got a taste for the tragic as well as the poignantly comic, Amreeka adds a new sweetness to the hope and distress of the immigrant experience.
The movie greedily uses its rich cast.	Emotionally engaging, sharply written and superbly directed drama with terrific performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney.	While writer-director Tamara Jenkins (Slums of Beverly Hills) lets things get a little mushy towards the end, the film brilliantly portrays a difficult family moment made even more complicated by her characters' overweening narcissism.	Predictably unconventional, indulgently metafictional, and hesitant about going for its alluded intentions.	There are no easy answers in dealing with aging and dying parents, and Jenkins doesn't try to give us one.	Thanks to a tender, funny script from director Tamara Jenkins, and fine performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney, this film delivers a nuanced, beautifully three-dimensional look at the struggles and comforts of family bonds.
Beast vs. beast, and it's not compelling in the least. Studio Fox rolls its two rampaging monster franchises out of cryo-stasis in this clunky and dumb sequel to the clunky and dumb 2004 eyesore, Alien vs. Predator	Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is a B movie that truly earns its B.	A worse AVP film than the first one just couldn't be made. Except that, impossibly, it has.	Where does this movie rank in the grand pantheon of Alien and Predator movies? Next to last. It's still better than ALIEN RESURRECTION.	After Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem it would be best to simply retire both these by-now over-familiar movie monsters . . .	The increased gore and violence over the first Alien vs. Predator can't excuse Requiem's disorientating editing, excessively murky lighting, and lack of new ideas.
By keeping sentimentality out, "I'll See You in My Dreams" leaves space for real emotion.	Bylthe Danner plays Carol with endearing grace, and a lot of chardonnay.	A far cry from the Nancy Meyers rom-com promised by its trailer, Brett Haley's directorial debut is a poignant if slight drama elevated by its impressive candor and by Blythe Danner's radiant performance.	"I'll See You in My Dreams" takes its time getting to unexpected places and makes you glad to follow along.	The kind of star turn that Oscar-worthy performances are made of, and that alone makes this wonderful crowd-pleaser a dream come true.	I'll See You in My Dreams would be worth watching even if Blythe Danner's central performance was all it had going for it, but this thoughtful drama satisfies on multiple levels.
Tokyo Sonata is a bit overwrought, especially in the final act, but it is beautifully shot, features moving performances by the well-chosen cast and has the unity of vision that is the hallmark of an auteur.	An extremely impressive and intricate family drama from Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa.	Only in the slightly overlong last act, as the family's misfortunes become truly existential, does director Kiyoshi Kurosawa take things to another level.	The film transcends conventions of genre and cultural boundaries, and turns out to be one of the most compelling, finely orchestrated and oddly enchanting films of the year so far.	A film that effectively examines both the familial conflicts in Japan's transitioning society and the wondrous avenues each individual within the family explores.	J-Horror director Kiyoshi Kurosawa turns successfully to dramedy and gives a unique (and specifically national) perspective to the universal subjects of family and identity.
First of a sci-fi phenomenon, #4 in the series.	This film was a cultural turning point and continues to be.	All in all, this movie is a classic.	It is the best such film since 2001, and in certain respects it is one of the most exciting ever made.	Twenty years later, George Lucas' loved saga of the war between good and evil in a distant galaxy returns in digitally enhanced and augmented form.	A legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possiblites of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same.
Real and consequential.	The unvarnished, non-enhanced spectacle of a human being executing a display of physical prowess will always have the power to astonish, and the young Mr. Bell proves this very nicely.	Illustrates how classic storylines, in the right hands, can work over and over again.	There's actually a lot going on in this little movie, and first-time feature director Stephen Daldry ... handles all of it deftly.	A very well made drama/comedy that will send everyone home happy and fulfilled.	Billy Elliot is a charming movie that can evoke both laughter and tears.
...gorgeously photographed and, like Babel, a subtly organized commentary on the ways people strive to communicate.	It sounds like a slight plot, and it is, but it is rich in detail that makes up for the simplicity of the story.	Relatively speaking, minor Yimou, yet it retains that extraordinary cinematic sensibility and superbly observed humanity that characterizes all his work.	The themes are universal (if a touch corny), the rugged Chinese scenery is stupendous, and the performances are touching.	When your dad says 'Don't be a stranger,' he means it--in	Doesn't reach the heights of Zhang Yimou's best, but this is still a heartwarming tale of love and forgiveness from the acclaimed Chinese director.
Polished prison-flick popcorn.	A career-ending missive from two seriously disturbed individuals.	What can you say about Robert Redford? Of course he delivers an excellent performance as the reserved yet determined General Irwin.	The Last Castle will likely do very well at the box office, not because it is particulary good, but becuase, simply put, timing is everything.	Redford's face is creased like a map, but he still has the body and the presence of a movie star	The Last Castle is well acted and rousing for the most part, but the story can't stand up to close scrutiny.
Skip, jump, run away, whatever! Do anything you have to do to avoid Hop, which treats its plot like a formality and its young viewers like brainwashed twits.	"Hop" is stuffed with humorous moments and clever gags.	It offers few surprises, and for your buck all you'll essentially get is a cringe-inducing dance number, lame gags and an admittedly alluring display of oversized chocolate. Avoid.	Marsden is working it as he embraces the silliest of moments and makes us laugh.	If anyone needed a reason to boycott Easter, this it.	It's impressively animated, but Hop's script is so uninspired that not even James Marsden's frantic mugging can give it any bounce.
With its obvious nods to Tati, a surprise for Charles Trenet lovers and much humour at the expense of celluloid pretensions, there's ample diversion here for even the snootiest cinemagoer.	Given its sense of quiet and penchant for harmless slapstick, a breath of fresh air in today's sea of raunchy, foul-mouthed sex comedies.	Mr. Bean's Holiday is a very cute movie. Unfortunately, cute is rarely funny.	It's an improvement, and even intermittently funny.	For a silly kids movie about an accident-prone man on a trip to the beach, Mr. Bean's Holiday is actually quite mean-spirited and pretentious.	Mr. Bean's Holiday means well, but good intentions can't withstand the 90 minutes of monotonous slapstick and tired, obvious gags.
Life Itself is the goodbye that many of us never wanted to say, but at long last it has been done, and with all the resounding power that Roger himself saw as just part of the process of living.	Even Ebert might have felt James' candid and compassionate assessment runs a bit long. But such is the consequence of a life lived, and told, in full.	"Life Itself" is a fitting tribute to the most popular, if also controversial film critic of his time	The true tragedy of Life Itself is that Roger isn't around to write about it. No one would have been able to say whatever there is to be said any better.	Life Itself is not just an overview of the life and times of famous film critic Roger Ebert, but it's also, and more poignantly, an examination of death and how both its victims and survivors grapple with it.	Rich in detail and warmly affectionate, Life Itself offers a joyful yet poignant tribute to a critical cinematic legacy.
Close but no cigar.	James Caan and Vera Farmiga are great, but they can't overcome a mediocre premise.	The screenplay leeches all the fun out of it, and the principals - aside from Caan, who generates his own power - seem lost and abandoned.	The early promise of Henry's Crime wanes as its efforts to splice crime caper with backstage drama becomes increasingly laboured. But with the cast on their game, the film just about gets away with it.	It's a   grab bag of comic clichés about bank robberies and regional theater.	Supporting actors Vera Farmiga and James Caan give the movie a little heft, but Henry's Crime is an otherwise predictable heist/comedy with slow pacing.
Rodriguez goes for broke with a breakneck pace, swarms of bullets, cinematic tricks, and a tone as playful as it is knowing of genre conventions. The director's light touch is all his own; and this unpretentious offering delivers in all departments.	Has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir.	An enormously entertaining movie.	Arguably the most amazing film made in 1990s.	Inspiring but misses a few cylinders	Made on a shoestring budget, El Mariachi's story is not new. However, the movie has so much energy that it's thoroughly enjoyable.
The screenplay, which begins as genuine comedy, soon degenerates into spurious melodrama.	To paraphrase a line from another famous film, what do you say about a movie that has everything?	Hilarious! some of Nichol's and Hoffman's best work.	...plastics, an apt description for the artificial people and attitudes around him.	Buck Henry's ironic script is at once biting and thoughtful.	The music, the performances, the precision in capturing the post-college malaise -- The Graduate's coming-of-age story is indeed one for the ages.
[A] wrenching story of working-poor desperation in northern England.	"The Selfish Giant" is devastating social realism in the mode of Ken Loach's "Kes."	Barnard's work with these two child actors is extraordinary, and she has written a lean script.	Barnard poetically suggests that the absence of good parenting turns childhood into a purgatory that can only end with adulthood's cruel arrival.	Allows hope and humour to mingle with the misery. Wilde's story and this peculiar tribute do, at least, have that much in common.	Starkly emotional and beautifully directed, The Selfish Giant uses a lovely script and some powerful performances to present some of the best that modern British cinema has to offer.
Didn't have to do much more than wrangle attention towards an important issue, but it does slightly more than that.	The result is a shocking but ultimately galvanizing work of reportage that meets the same high standard of their previous collaboration, The Invisible War, about sexual assault in the military.	The subject matter may not lend itself to an overtly ambitious aesthetic, but a film about individuals who refuse to be silenced could stand to take a few more chances itself.	The Hunting Ground qualifies as activist filmmaking. More power to it. You can read all the statistics you want, but there's no substitute for bearing witness - especially in such overwhelming numbers.	Shocks and awakens its audience in all the right ways, bringing the recent headlines of a Columbia University rape survivor carrying her mattress around into sharp focus.	The Hunting Ground isn't director Kirby Dick's strongest work as a filmmaker, but the movie's powerful message more than trumps any technical weaknesses.
Pattinson isn't quite the stiff he appears to be in Twilight, the costumes and sets look great, and the film could be recommended to patients who have been advised by their doctors to avoid stress or excitement.	The sleepy-eyed Pattinson is so lifeless that you keep expecting someone to put a mirror to his nostrils. Oh wait - wrong movie.	The film always seems to be on the cusp of locating some bigger truth about one's life and destiny, but this cinematic treatment loses its way by focusing almost solely on a sudsy, perfunctory love triangle.	This compressed, stilted screen adaptation disapponts but it's not a total loss.	The film's very old-fashioned sense of right and wrong is refreshing. However, the need for strong plotting and characterisation...never goes out of vogue, and it's on these terms that Water For Elephants feels truncated.	It's a tale tastefully told and beautifully filmed, but Water for Elephants suffers from a pronounced lack of chemistry between its leads.
A clever and shiny and deliriously funny take on the classic princess genre	An almost perfect Disney family film with Donna Murphy being the standout star.	Tangled is a serviceable kids' picture and marks a milestone in the history of Disney animation, but it's splitting hairs to characterize it beyond that.	It's Mandy Moore's performance that seals the deal with a charm and personality I didn't know she had--incredibly well rendered by the animation team off her sprightly voice track.	This is your basic, and very enjoyable, Disney princess musical, an empowerment tale to teach bright, dreamy girls how to grow to maturity -- and outgrow the adults in charge.	While far from Disney's greatest film, Tangled is a visually stunning, thoroughly entertaining addition to the studio's classic animated canon.
To me, the highlight of 'Larry Crowne' is the way Larry (Tom Hanks), Mercedes (Julia Roberts), and the community college students impact each other's lives.	An endless slog of flat platitudes, generic cliches, and clumsily on-the-nose saccharine sweetness that feels about as sincere as a Hallmark card.	Even if you wander into this congealed mess with nothing more demanding in mind than to spend a little time with two charming favorites, do not expect Forrest Gump or Pretty Woman.	Larry Crowne makes losing your job, your car and your house look like the greatest thing to happen to a middle aged man.	Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts can't save this comedy from its own blandness	Despite the relaxed, easy chemistry of stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, Larry Crowne is surprisingly bland and conventional.
Has similar sea-going survival thrills as Life of Pi, but somehow means more.	Undeniably beautiful and exciting even if its directors do err a little on the safe side.	"Kon-Tiki" is awesome in the true sense of the word: You sit in awe of the bravery, audacity, stupidity and natural power on display. Ah, to imagine and dream. And to go forth.	"Kon-Tiki" is stalwart and uplifting and there are passing moments of wonder.	"Kon-Tiki" ends up being a little underwhelming, lacking the strength that such a story deserves. There are parts of it that work pretty well, but sadly, more often than not, it leaves you feeling adrift.	A well-crafted retelling of an epic true story, Kon Tiki is a throwback to old-school adventure filmmaking that's exciting and entertaining in spite of its by-the-book plotting.
Funny People is like Terms of Endearment done in a milieu where the most endearing compliment anyone can give refers to penis size.	click for full review	Apatow's whiny characters pitch audiences into a vat of self-pity.	There is not a single character in the entire movie worth caring about. The most genuine laughs come when the cast plays the peanut butter game. A person lies on the kitchen floor, spreads peanut butter on his or her face and has a dog lick it off.	The funny business is lame in Funny People, and the people feel phony. So what's left in this dramedy about a comic's near-tragedy? Well, how do bad standup and schmaltzy emotions sound?	Funny People features the requisite humor, as well as considerable emotional depth, resulting in Judd Apatow's most mature film to date.
Director David L. Cunningham and screenwriter John Hodge ("Trainspotting") conspire with a gruelingly slow pacing to underpin nebulous special effects sequences. "The Seeker" is a children's fantasy movie worth avoiding.	A movie that should've been made shortly after its source material -- Susan Cooper's Newbery winner -- debuted in 1973. As is, it feels entirely too generic to work today.	What's the fun of being a seeker if you don't actually get to do any seeking?	The acting is mediocre, the story rambles, the special effects -- average at best.	A modest proposal: What say we declare a moratorium on special-effects movies about adolescents on a quest to save the world from darkness?	The magic of the book is lost in translation with The Seeker, due to its clumsy plot and lack of heart.
A hard-hitting western with upper-case values out of the busy Italo stable, this is a topnotch action entry.	A delicious second helping of Clint & Sergio!	Here is a gloriously greasy, sweaty, hairy, bloody and violent Western. It is delicious.	Clint Eastwood, just as the spagetti western schtick was beginning to get old.	The amoral film should give the less hardy pause as to its relevance or worth or endorsement for vigilante justice.	With Clint Eastwood in the lead, Ennio Morricone on the score, and Sergio Leone's stylish direction, For a Few Dollars More earns its recognition as a genre classic.
Malkovich's performance is too awkwardly manic, and Hanks' is too sleepy - paving the way for Emily Blunt to steal the movie.	While Colin Hanks will probably never be the acting genius his father is, that Hanks charm still shines through.	Malkovich is superb as the outwardly gracious, inwardly hostile and acerbic has-been.	The film is a small-scale charmer that provides a tailor-made role for Malkovich, who is always fun to watch.	If Great Buck Howard is formulaic and only mildly funny, however, Malkovich is nonetheless magnificent.	By turns fluffy and biting, this show biz comedy is given girth by comic heavyweight John Malkovich and made all the more charming by Emily Blunt.
The film is darkly atmospheric, with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst's forced avuncular chortles.	Notable mostly for Kirsten Dunst's superb portrayal of Marion Davies.	More obvious than acerbic, more inane than insightful and exaggerated to the point of caricature.	it never seems to gel, nor does it allow for any other interpretations, which takes all the fun out of the mystery.	Though The Cat's Meow just sorta comes to a so-what ending and stops short, the getting there is delicious.	The Cat's Meow is a deliciously evoked period piece and whodunit.
Costner approaches the project with an earnest nobility that's quite impressive, mainly because Earnest Nobility often becomes Unintentional Hilarity when coaxed too adamantly	It won't be long before Kevin Costner films are viewed by prescription only._ No drug could come close to curing insomnia in the way that Kevin's latest movie does.	If you grew up on Westerns, which are now an old-time religion, Open Range is a ride you want to share.	Open Range puts Kevin Costner at the reins of a terrific movie.	'Open Range' is simply a grand cinematic experience.	Greatly benefiting from the tremendous chemistry between Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall, Open Range is a sturdy modern Western with classic roots.
Likeable characters and a cliched but meatier-than-usual story for a teen comedy.	It's harmless enough, but unless you fit into the target audience (the under-17 crowd), you might want to find something a little less juvenile and a lot more entertaining.	Distinguished by certain rodent-like features, Qualls is a bargain-basement, pre-adult version of David Spade -- and becomes just as tiresome.	The film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down.	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name.	Incoherent, silly, and unoriginal, The New Guy offers up the same old teen gross-out comedy cliches.
Plays like a cheesy '80s TV movie.	A solid -- if routine -- entry in the Jack Ryan series.	a tightly constructed political thriller overflowing with fanatical terrorists, red-faced politicians, double-crossing spies and hidden agendas	Now see why Harison Ford decided not to play Jack Ryan once again in this very flawed film.	It's a testament to how effective The Sum of All Fears really is that it sends you home feeling more scared than you were before.	A slick and well-made thriller that takes on new weight due to the current political climate.
This satire about an aging heavy metal drummer finds a good comic rhythm.	If only the movie had some bite, some edge, some anger, some insight. Instead it's generic, staying far away from the darker temptations of the rock scene.	There are occasionally amusing moments, but the writing lacks the warmth that made School of Rock such a hit.	Just because one is a scene stealer on TV does not mean he or she is big screen material, period, much less a movie star.	School of Rock, Tenacious D and about million comedies of prolonged adolescence have stripped most of the bigger nuggets from this particular seam.	With a predictable and lightweight story, the earnest efforts of the cast are squandered by The Rocker's bland script.
It's still spring, but the films of this benighted summer can't get any worse than Speed 2, which demonstrates with shameless cynicism Hollywood's contempt for its audience.	Incredible ineptitude, a terminally shaky camera and plotholes you could drive the universe through.	Bullock, who has a sly and wonderful way of bringing wit and charm to every project she's associated with, is relegated to little more than a bystander.	De Bont remains an expert director of action, but putting the reference to cruise control in the title serves as fair warning of an unengaged filmmaker on automatic pilot.	It's painful to see Mr. Dafoe, an excellent actor, reduced to a snarling mad dog who treats his fatal disease -- copper poisoning? -- with leeches and spouts lines like ''Now you're gonna get it!''	Speed 2 falls far short of its predecessor, thanks to laughable dialogue, thin characterization, unsurprisingly familiar plot devices, and action sequences that fail to generate any excitement.
Almost untenably cool, but beneath the sheen there's substance.	It's probably the best looking movie I've ever seen.	The Matrix is fun. It's thought-provoking, especially if you are touched with a pinch of paranoia. It's loud, explosive and a movie science fiction fans will appreciate.	Who would have thought that a Keanu Reeves movie could be intellectually as well as visually satisfying?	The Matrix does indeed have a plot and sense of "mythos" that grounds it and makes it more than the sum of all of its special effects wizardry.	Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects.
This is fun but, compared with Kurosawa's other 60s efforts, relatively slight.	Kurosawa was pressured by his producers into directing this sequel to Yojimbo, and rose to the occasion by making his funniest and least overtly didactic film	For escapist fare, this ranks highly	A surprising, fetching, beautifully made film that fitly propounds the lesson of his own professionalism: 'Never send a boy to do a man's work.'	Mifune's disheveled samurai is an almost cartoonlike send-up of the established samurai image.	Technically impressive and superbly acted, Sanjuro is a funny, action-packed samurai adventure featuring outstanding cinematography and a charismatic performance from Toshiro Mifune.
It's hilarious and wicked and cutting about the way things work in governments.	There mayn't have been a funnier screenplay this year -- but the laughs are bitter ones.	Blistering satire ... scabrous laughs. And it's so easy to imagine that this really is how governments make earth-shaking decisions.	It's a sharper, bawdier version of Yes, Minister. And ultimately just as cosy, colluding in our cynicism about politicians rather than challenging it.	The brainchild of British director Armando Iannucci, it takes on the politicians at their own dirty game, daring to fictionally embellish the tawdry facts, to out-spin the spin doctors.	In the Loop is an uncommonly funny political satire that blends Dr. Strangelove with Spinal Tap for the Iraq war era.
While Steamboy lacks the emotional resonance and psychological complexity of Akira, it is state-of-the-art anime made by one of the masters.	Its problem is not a lack of things to look at. There's plenty of them, and they're all cool. It's just that, in this world of clanking, hissing machines, even the people seem like robots.	No matter how big and impressive, all of this pales in comparison to the human soul, which this film simply does not have.	It's a roller-coaster action film that thunders along with top-notch set pieces and studiously researched period settings.	The 'wow' factor in Steamboy's visual energy is powerful enough to enthrall everybody's inner 12-year-old.	The story isn't the greatest, but there's an abundance of sci-fi eye candy to compensate.
Mischievous updating of the Henry James novel, made especially moving by young Onata Aprile.	Since moving into domestic subjects, their (Scott McGehee and David Siegel's) footing has been less sure, and you'll resent What Maisie Knew's tidy conclusion.	McGehee and Siegel -- as well as the adult cast -- are to be commended for keeping the film's depiction of marital strife from falling into melodrama and goopy sentimentality.	This modern-day adaptation of Henry James's novel about a child shuttled back and forth between her divorced parents features an excellent performance from newcomer Onata Aprile.	This is a fine idea for a PSA TV commercial, but (a) they already did it back in the '70s and (b) it goes on well past the 30-second mark.	It's undeniably difficult to watch at times, but What Maisie Knew ultimately rises on the strength of its solidly sourced script, powerful performances, and empathetic direction.
Marshall could very well be the Caravaggio of the B-movie.	The babes are buff and the scares bountiful in Neil Marshall's full-throttle horror freakout about six women on a caving expedition.	The Descent is so expertly made that it more than holds its own as a full-throttle horror flick, yet it's Marshall's decision to provide it with a psychological bent that puts it firmly over the top.	Made with a connoisseur's love of muck, blood, inky darkness, and equal parts elegance and ewwww, The Descent raises the level of the post-Blair Witch, post-Open Water horror game.	A clever blend of psychological thrills and stalked-by-monster terror is what makes writer-director Neil Marshall's sophomore effort a cut above most horror films.	Deft direction and strong performances from its all-female cast guide The Descent, a riveting, claustrophobic horror film.
Déjŕ Vu isn't meant for heavy thinking; it's simply designed as entertainment. On that level, it's hard to fault.	This is an excellent popcorn movie...	The movie's biggest charm is its unpredictable, offbeat tone.	Deja vu is French for 'Haven't I seen this somewhere before?' That reaction will be widespread among audiences for Deja Vu.	Loud, noisy and not nearly as smart as it thinks it is.	Tony Scott tries to combine action, science fiction, romance, and explosions into one movie, but the time travel conceit might be too preposterous and the action falls apart under scrutiny.
A wonderful turn of the found footage sub-genre that watches like a part found footage movie, and part documentary shoot that took a turn in to hell.	While the final "reveal" feels at once expected but out of nowhere, Willow Creek is a solid look inside the mind of someone obsessed with one of our weird national myths.	The two actors establish a realistic chemistry, and the otherwise familiar movie cranks up the tension by exploiting common fears.	It's definitely worth watching and it's impressive what Goldthwait and his two leads were able to accomplish with what couldn't have been much more than a $100 budget and a weekend.	"Willow Creek" a canny horror film and a derivative one, but as a reminder of the power of suggestion, the unseen dwarfing even the grandest budgets, prodding our imagination and chills us to the bones.	Writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait's first foray into horror doesn't break any new ground, but it does wring fresh terror from a well-worn genre formula -- and offers a few nasty laughs in the bargain.
[A] spectacularly beautiful movie.	The kids are going to love it.	It is a good thing the tigers at the center of Two Brothers give such strong performances. Without them, the movie would be a lifeless bore.	Works as an engrossing outdoor adventure and quasi-documentary.	An extraordinary film about two wild tigers and the human beings who are changed irreparably by their encounters with these magnificent and mysterious creatures.	A charming family-friendly movie with stunning cinematography.
It combines a fresh and exciting style with stunning performances and that rarity in current film, a deeply humanistic story.	As emoушes retratadas pelo longa sсo simples, mas intensas e genuьnas.	Simple yet deep. Not for blockbuster fans but amazing in its own way.	The most spiritually potent and questioning movie we are likely to see this year, one whose basic and often elusive lesson is how rigorous, demanding and costly it can be to behave with charity and act with forgiveness.	[Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne's] most gripping film to date.	Austere, finely crafted, and compelling.
A beautifully produced, intelligently written and pleasingly well-acted bit of faux Capra-corn.	A treacly, synthetic and wildly overlong drama that aspires to Frank Capra-style uplift, but winds up suffocating you with its aura of bogus, store-bought nostalgia.	Succeeds because of the earnestness with which it is being told.	A decent picture that you really want to like, but that unfortunately doesn't come close to matching the director's previous efforts.	Smugness -- the sense that the filmmakers are doing God's work -- permeates much of The Majestic.	Ponderous and overlong, The Majestic drowns in forced sentimentality and resembles a mish-mash of other, better films.
In the Company of Men is a singularly unpleasant movie. And from the point that Chad and Howard settle on Christine, it's an increasingly unbelievable one, too.	Has been both exalted as a brilliant satire and scorned as a shallow burp of white male indigestion posing as satire. It's probably a little of both.	The kind of bold, uncompromising film that insists on being thought about afterward -- talked about, argued about, hated if necessary, but not ignored.	A dazzling, repellent exercise in which the case against men is closed before it's opened.	It's the kind of film that really makes you think and turns you upside down.	Neil LaBute's pitch-black comedy is a masterful exploration of male insecurity, and it's elevated by a breakout performance by Aaron Eckhart as a businessman who likes to play psychological games.
Cameron is forever associated with the fateful ship, and I think it's time he moved on.	This is a brilliant showcase for IMAX and Cameron who offer an entertaining and fascinating glimpse of history to us all.	Despite Paxton's whooping every time a new artefact comes on screen, it's hard to be constantly excited about watching a bunch of rusty, decayed junk -- historic and three-dimensional though it may be.	Ghosts Of the Abyss is an interesting experiment which fails to take full advantage of the real opportunity granted in its inception - to utilize emerging technology to explore terrain that has never been witnessed by humans. . .	Documentary dramatizations usually are awful, but in Ghosts of the Abyss, they work.	The underwater footage is both beautiful and awe-inspiring.
Frothy, sentimental and thoroughly good-natured, Malcolm D. Lee's tale of coming-of-age at the roller disco doesn't have an original bone in its body, but it's as energetic, eager to please and endearing.	This is the 40th "skating movie" to hit the screens since Charlie Chaplin's The Rink (1915). It is neither the best nor the worst of them - skater dudes may think its cool, but 25 years ago there was the much maligned Xanadu with ELO, ONJ and (sigh!) stil	The end of the dismal summer movie season couldn't have been blessed with a more satisfying coda than the rollicking, funny, relentlessly cheery and genuinely touching spirit that makes Roll Bounce a captivating delight from start to finish.	I enjoyed it in all its cheesiness.	Formulaic as it is, Roll Bounce is still a blast.	Roll Bounce dazzles us with a classic late 1970's feel, but this coming of age film could have been more than just a spin around the roller rink.
Estes dives into this material as if it's never been done before, and his characters and situations are so realistic and the film's tone is so assured that he succeeds at making it feel fresh.	The problem with dramas about doomed teenagers movies is that once you have seen one of them, in a way you've seen them all.	The nuanced performances, well-used locations and sensitive script set it far above the typical Hollywood teen flick.	[Writer-director Jacob Aaron Estes] coats everything in a brooding self-importance, as if he was intent on making the most depressing After-School Special ever.	Estes' debut feature's strength lies in its crackling intensity, ultra-sharp character insights and an affinity for teenage protagonists who look and sound like real teens.	Mean Creek is an uncomfortably riveting glimpse into the casual cruelty of youth.
Reaches for complexity but ends up, as you'd expect from a partnership with Masterpiece Theater, rendering Pierrepoint palatable as a decent, principled chap who was just doing his job.	Dark but absorbing.	You have to wonder just how true to life the melodramatic depiction of these events is.	The movie grows more compelling in the latter half as British public opinion turns against capital punishment and Pierrepoint begins to have his own doubts.	Spall is the perfect character actor for the part, managing to convey both a strange sympathy and sadness as he stares into the eyes of his doomed charges.	Director Adrian Shergold doesn't shy away from the darker elements of the movie's subject, and Timothy Spall is mesmerizing as the title character.
Without unpredictability or the possibility of an unhappy ending, how can a film truly inspire?	An absolute triumph for Denzel Washington. Here is a movie that can make a difference. What more can you ask from a film?	Not only is this a feel good story, but it's moving and inspirational for all.	The actor-director brings the energy and rhythms of a sports flick to a little-known bit of American history in his deeply enjoyable film The Great Debaters.	The Great Debaters is passionate in a professional way, a very fine movie that should have challenged its audience as much as it challenged its characters.	A wonderful cast and top-notch script elevate The Great Debaters beyond a familiar formula for a touching, uplifting drama.
Filmmaker Scott Frank develops characters and layers detail so well that his absorbing, well-acted crime thriller The Lookout sometimes doesn't seem like a crime thriller at all. It plays more as a study of a young man coping with life.	A solid debut. [Writer-director Scott] Frank never overpowers this at-times familiar material. Aiming for a film that's character-driven, he gets sharp performances that hold promise for the nascent director.	First-time director Scott Frank, who penned Out of Sight and Minority Report, shapes some sharp noirish notes.	Frank doesn't just set up clichés, he breaks them in two and spits in our face for buying into them...	has all the right elements of tension, story, a little comic relief, and solid acting that makes it one of those movies you will tell your friends to see.	The Lookout is a genuinely suspenseful and affecting noir due to the great ensemble cast and their complex, realistic characters.
The film isn't as blisteringly satirical as The Simpsons; it's warmer. And while its nostalgia isn't simplistic, it is affectionate.	A fun, entertaining and occasionally heartfelt, eighty-some minute diversion from the trials and tribulations of being a kid.	Bird's film exudes the warmth and humor and sense of wonder that distinguished E.T. But a darker undercurrent also flows -- a mistrust of authority that harkens as much to Dr. Strangelove as to Spielberg's epic.	Finally -- a terrific summer film for kids!	What the animators lack in new computer-drawn technique, they creatively make up for with a fine artistic sense.	The endearing Iron Giant tackles ambitious topics and complex human relationships with a steady hand and beautifully animated direction from Brad Bird.
What his other movies have done summarily or languidly, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels does with some clear novice stumbles. It's creative and very clever. It's just not a classic.	Though Ritchie isn't the most accomplished filmmaker, his artistic use of freeze-frames, slow motion and other camera trickery proves he is a precocious talent to be reckoned with in the future.	The best film since Pulp Fiction in which there are no really good guys.	Even when the violence gets out of control, as bad as 'a bad day in Bosnia,' there's an underlying level of wit and humor.	A very funny, very violent and altogether wonderful British crime caper that could have been made by Tarantino's cockney cousin, if he had one.	Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a grimy, twisted, and funny twist on the Tarantino hip gangster formula.
Clumsy direction means most jokes fall flatter than the paper-thin plot.	Mildly entertaining and utterly innocuous...	What begins as tedious teen comedy/drama about a Californian brat turns out to be a surprisingly agreeable popcorn flick.	Bright and silly, with just enough wit and intelligence to make it watchable, this British-American teen comedy doesn't break much new ground, but is pretty entertaining while it lasts.	A project broad-based enough to make tween competitor Angus, Thongs And Perfect Snogging feel arthouse.	More mild than wild. This tween comedy mess falls flat on its face due to poor characters, poor direction and poor jokes.
Punk'd star in adult jail-house comedy.	Let's Go to Prison feels like an overextended sketch-comedy idea insufficiently filled out by subsidiary characters (few significantly figure) or standout setpieces.	Life's too short.	The writers of this movie should be sentenced to a comedy chain gang peeling bananas and making cream pies.	Because the movie can't bring itself to take that leap into full-on absurdity, the characters and comic opportunities stay confined to their cells.	Let's Go to Prison is guilty on all counts of cliched setups, base humor, and failure to ellicit laughs.
The simple and straightforward approach makes it more unsettling and provocative, offering a clinical yet suspenseful morality play about power and control.	The movie 'The Stanford Prison Experiment' tensely and relentlessly shows how easily these affluent, intelligent college students devolved into victims and victimizers.	Alvarez captures an emotional immediacy and risk that is deliberately excluded from academic debate.	The acting is uniformly strong and the camera work is winningly claustrophobic, but the film is one note: scene after scene of bullying.	An at times very upsetting film about our true nature, The Stanford Prison Experiment is full of great performances, particularly from Michael Angarano and Ezra Miller.	As chillingly thought-provoking as it is absorbing and well-acted, The Stanford Prison Experiment offers historical drama that packs a timelessly relevant punch.
Director Rob Cohen ("The Skulls"), whose filmography inspired no hope going into this film, delivers a flashy B flick that's sure to attain a cult audience	Finally, a REAL drive-in B-movie. It's a bad movie, alright, but in the best possible way.	The disconcertingly but finally happy surprise of the picture comes with the way it persuades you to its perverse point of view.	The film can be regarded from two angles: from the street-racing perspective and the plot perspective. Guess which one matters more? ... The real meat of the movie is in the racing scenes.	It may just be too bad to be 'so bad, it's good.'	Sleek and shiny on the surface, The Fast and the Furious recalls those cheesy teenage exploitation flicks of the 1950s.
Any movie that ends on a freeze frame of Richard Gere walking stoically away from a crime scene teeming with police car lights can't be all good.	An impressive and gritty cop drama with three strong leading performances.	Biblical trilogy bolstered by strong performances and a powerful message.	'Brooklyn's Finest' juggles three separate but interlocking storylines, and it takes considerable effort and intense audience concentration to decide which of the trio is the most tedious.	Whatever one may think of the overall style -- I think it's ludicrous -- Mr. Fuqua clearly wanted his film to be operatic, and so it is, in a tone-deaf way.	It's appropriately gritty, and soaked in the kind of palpable tension Antoine Fuqua delivers so well, but Brooklyn's Finest suffers from the comparisons its cliched script provokes.
Without any build-up either by the scriptwriter or director, he is sent onstage, where he, looks a lot less terrifying and not nearly as funny as Mr. Disney's big, bad wolf.	Horror movies today rely on gore and as many jump out of your seat moments as they can throw at you. This one relies on old fashioned atmosphere and acting ability and that's all it really needs.	Apesar de ter se transformado em um personagem trágico e fascinante nos filmes posteriores da série (com seu constante desejo de morrer), Larry Talbot é apenas um monstro convencional e nada interessante neste primeiro capítulo.	The Wolf Man is a compactly-knit tale of its kind, with good direction and performances by an above par assemblage of players, but dubious entertainment.	A film of sometimes uncertain greatness that is nonetheless the most entertaining and effective Universal monster movie since Bride of Frankenstein.	A handsomely told tale with an affecting performance from Lon Chaney, Jr., The Wolf Man remains one of the classics of the Universal horror stable.
I left the theater with joy in my heart. And it's all because of Winn-Dixie.	A children's film that embraces storytelling modesty and a balanced view of the world as both depressing and joyous.	The movie offers a loving but strikingly tempered assessment of family and town life that one seldom finds in today's raucous family films.	It's not that the film is a family classic; far from it. But the simple, heartwarming story of a girl and her dog, based on the popular book by Kate DiCamillo, should satisfy its 8- to 12-year-old target demographic.	The moment is so identical to a pivotal scene in Lars von Trier's Dogville that it makes one wonder if director Wayne Wang is intentionally paying homage.	An old-fashioned, if bland, adaptation of Kate DiCamillo's novel.
A performance de Michael Caine representa, por si só, motivo suficiente para qualquer um assistir a este filme.	Irving's story is a little simplistic but engaging and the film captures a sort of nostalgic feel.	I wish the movie had narrowed and sharpened its focus. Still, I enjoyed it overall.	Easily the finest film realization of an Irving novel.	A bouillabaisse of all the best soap opera elements - orphans, abortion, debilitating injuries and, of course, death.	The Cider House Rules has wonderful performances, lovely visuals, and an old-fashioned feel.
The film isn't quite a memoir; it's also a platform to branch off into other areas, briskly and informatively and with a good deal of clearheadedness.	It's an interesting story and is well-told for the most part.	...a tightly assembled doc that flows evenly and does its job of informing and entertaining the viewer.	It'll shake up your beliefs not just about steroids but about competition, hypocrisy, body obsession and American notions of masculinity.	It may or may not change your opinion of how we should treat steroids in America, but it will at least give you greater sympathy for people who use them.	Bigger, Stronger, Faster* is a fascinating, informative, entertaining and especially introspective account of the American 'enhancement' culture.
Stiles, whose slightly rushed, impatient delivery sometimes recalls the young Jane Fonda, lets enough sweetness seep into her portrayal to lend even the nastiest retort a hint of forgiveness.	What raises this venture a few notches above your normal acne fare is an extremely clever screenplay	Despite a tinny script, the cast puts in fine performances in what is a very unfunny movie. But the praise stops there.	The performances by Stiles and Ledger stand out.	Debut film director Gil Junger may be a TV veteran making a movie for the Clearasil crowd, but he doesn't sacrifice the story to gimmicky camerawork or overzealous pacing.	Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger add strong performances to an unexpectedly clever script, elevating 10 Things (slightly) above typical teen fare.
The movie is full of risible pontifications about the nature of art but falls well short of capturing the angst of creative frustration.	Where Fellini dared us to race alongside his imagination, Marshall is thuddingly cautious.	Nine offers mostly lackluster music ... Yet, without the music, Nine would be that absolutely unnecessary object: a remake of 8 1/2.	The songs here are not particularly catchy, and while the choreography and set design are tops, they do little to elevate the almost relentlessly somber mood.	Director Rob Marshall has come up with something close to an ideal modern screen musical. It is every inch a toe-tapping, show- stopping tour de force that has a big chance of snagging some gold come awards season.	It has a game, great-looking cast, led by the always worthwhile Daniel Day-Lewis, but Rob Marshall's Nine is chaotic and curiously distant.
Um dos melhores filmes do ano, O Jardineiro Fiel é, também, um dos mais importantes.	The Constant Gardener can boast of prime cinematography, an engaging and multi-layered storyline, and a handsome, controlled performance by Ralph Fiennes.	The film is engaging, still it never connects with much more than a curiosity. The emotions run, but not deep.	A somber, angry, cynical, slow burn of a political potboiler that is also, against all odds, an effectively moving love story.	A rarity this summer, a smart, gripping thriller that takes politics seriously and is also effective as a personal love story, with top notch Fiennes and Weisz in the leads	The Constant Gardener is a smart, gripping, and suspenseful thriller with rich performances from the leads.
Cat lovers may be unnerved, but fright fans will just yawn their way to the exit.	Its most fiendish moment comes when one girl yanks out another's bellybutton ring. Not that -- anything but that!	If ever a thriller were to inspire a collective "eh," it's got to be "The Roommate." It's not a good movie, by any means, but it's also not bad enough to have fun hating on.	How this meek thriller manages to cycle through so many titillating elements, without producing any actual titillation, is something of an accomplishment.	In the theater where I saw it, the tedium was broken only by the sound of Angry Birds being played on iPhones.	Devoid of chills, thrills, or even cheap titillation, The Roommate isn't even bad enough to be good.
Delicately photographed, whimsically scored and patiently paced, Station doesn't rely on flash and panache to make its points. But the points do come across elegantly.	The lack of focus ultimately leaves too much of it as surface level when we really needed to get under the skin of Leo and Sofya Tolstoy in the way these great performers deserved.	Helen Mirren is a lusty, roaring wonder playing, of all things, the long-suffering wife of Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer in peak form).	Despite its literary pedigree, this stagy production mixes ribaldry and campy overacting.	Plummer is just fantastic overall, and easily the best reason to sit through the film's two-hour running time.	Michael Hoffman's script doesn't quite live up to its famous subject, but this Tolstoy biopic benefits from a spellbinding tour de force performance by Helen Mirren.
A beautifully painted portrait of everyday Arab immigrant life in France among a large dysfunctional family.	The French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche is that rare thing at the movies these days: an intelligent humanist.	Warmly magical... Building to a tender Big Night-like feast where the gang's all here, suspense is as thick and exciting as communal joy, and a single sexy surprise proves one of the greatest moments in film this year...	Aside from a slight flabbiness ... Kechiche is to be praised for exploring the nature of change on a personal and a community level -- and packing the result with some emotional wallop.	The film works on a slow burn but by the end it has become utterly engrossing.	A complex portrait of an immigrant family, The Secret of the Grain is a sprawling, intimate film with many fine performances.
This is an emotional look at a complex issue by director Stephen Daldry, with exceptional performances by Kate Winslet and David Kross.	The film...hankers after something redemptive. But whatever difficult possibilities about guilt and silence it explores are dissolved into disconcerting blandness.	Daldry's directorial restraint and power perfectly serves David Hare's impressive screenplay and delivers a memorable movie-going experience.	The film doesn't shove its message down your throat, and its prestige pic status belies its subtle intelligence.	The movie adaptation by screenwriter David Hare and director Stephen Daldry starts out choppy and overdrawn but develops a cumulative power.	Despite Kate Winslet's superb portrayal, The Reader suggests an emotionally distant, Oscar-baiting historical drama.
Showalter's Elliot, self-described as the kind of guy who gets hay fever just raking the leaves, never breaks out of the Baxter cliché. Frankly, he makes a pretty good case for why the sad sack never gets the girl.	Savvy viewers will see through this pastiche of shopworn goods.	It contains a wry, throwback charm.	The biggest failing of The Baxter is that the humor is often just too obscure.	Writer-director Michael Showalter flirts with a great premise, but his slight love story gets cold feet.	The Baxter is good-natured, but there are simply not enough laughs to fuel this comedy.
Ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling.	Hopkins, who is electrifying in almost anything he does, reprises the mastery he brought to Silence of the Lambs. Even in a movie as patchworky as this, he's always compelling.	Hannibal should make everyone involved ashamed.	Es un filme bastante bien logrado en todos sentidos sin llegar a lo excelso.	Hannibal doesn't grip the audience with the macabre wit and pervasive sense of impending evil of its predecessor	While superbly acted and stylishly filmed, Hannibal lacks the character interaction between the two leads which made the first movie so engrossing.
Country star Toby Keith makes his acting debut in this rickety heartland drama, which was produced by Country Music Television and panders shamelessly to the traditional-values crowd.	Soundtrack sales seem to be the main motivation behind this corny and cliched Southern melodrama that marks the film debut of country music star Toby Keith.	The Country Music Channel's first foray into feature filmmaking is sickly sweet and thoroughly predictable.	Broken Bridges feels scrapped-together, like something that might have premiered on the old Turner South network.	An imperfect but emotionally true and often magnificently acted drama.	A cliched attempt at a feel-good drama, Broken Bridges is schmaltzy, predictable, and stiffly acted.
Sure, there's gunplay, thievery, and general drunken disorderliness, but . . . the season is made bright, relatively, without even one of those annoying sugar plum fairies	If all you are looking for is a funny diversion from the overload of holiday cheer, you will enjoy the movie.	Bad Santa is the most fun you'll have while watching someone destroy themselves.	Best of all, it plugs into -- and electrifies -- the mostly unacknowledged grimness that lies just beneath our holiday cheer.	This amusingly venal, possibly shocking tale is just what Scrooge ordered.	A gloriously rude and gleefully offensive black comedy, Bad Santa isn't for everyone, but grinches will find it uproariously funny.
... a two-hour preview trailer for The Avengers ...	A brilliant addition to the Marvel world. He came, he Thor, he kicked some ass.	Branagh has knocked his film together with a terrific, freewheeling gusto. It has its tongue in its cheek and the fun is infectious. For all of its faults, Thor's never a bore.	As great as Hemsworth and Hiddleston are, they cannot overcome the film's flaws. All they can do is drag THOR up from awful to fairly tolerable.	Thor has the feel of a film that never quite starts.	A dazzling blockbuster that tempers its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and human drama, Thor is mighty Marvel entertainment.
Its plot comes across as just a rickety skeleton designed to prop up Sandler and company's litany of cornball punchlines and gags, only a few of which cleverly play off of these characters' iconography	While Hotel Transylvania 2 is a visual marvel, it doesn't come anywhere close to the originality of the first movie. The story is weaker, the laughs are infrequent, and you can feel the movie's desperate attempts to seem hip.	Where's a wooden stake when you need one?	Hotel Transylvania 2 offers cute but brainless escapism for young moviegoers - as well as parents looking to distract their children for a few hours.	Good news is that Sandler as a writer is still exploring the fatherhood themes that we saw in the first one, bad news is it feels like we already saw this movie in 2012. [Full review in Spanish]	Hotel Transylvania 2 is marginally better than the original, which may or may not be enough of a recommendation to watch 89 minutes of corny, colorfully animated gags from Adam Sandler and company.
The post-apocalypse hath no fury like a one-armed woman... George Miller pulls off a rarity in Hollywood blockbusters these days: A muscular action masterpiece built on practical effects, weighty and awe-inspiring.	Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching a non-stop, two-hour-long action-packed trailer ... Watching Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching the circus.	"Fury Road" is a movie in which action speaks louder than words. Miller and his production team fill the screen with a wide variety of amazing and impressive stunts, which will have you gaping in disbelief, while holding the dialogue to a minimum.	Stripped of such frivolities as plot and character development, Fury Road is two hours of rolling thunder that will leave your inner 12-year-old giggling with glee.	An orgy of loud and louder, leaving us alternately exhilarated, exasperated and exhausted.	With exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft, Mad Max: Fury Road brings George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life.
Could do for intelligent design what An Inconvenient Truth did for global warming.	doesn't have the brisk economy of the original book, but the animated Horton feels nevertheless close to the sweet, quirky heart of Dr. Seuss.	When Horton sticks to the sweet, funny spirit of its source, though, all's right with the worlds, big and little.	bears little resemblance to the "Horton" I imagined in my youth, but the kiddies that filled the theater around me seemed to eat it all up.	Horton is a wonderful family outing for parents to share with their children.	Horton Hears A Who! is both whimsical and heartwarming, and is the rare Dr. Seuss adaptation that stays true to the spirit of the source material.
In the title role, Vincent Cassel is a relentless force...	Not only does it provide a breathlessly exciting concluding chapter, it deepens our understanding of Mesrine by providing some psychological complexity to counter the unapologetically celebratory first half.	You needn't have seen the first chapter to be swept up in this swirl of bloodletting and braggadocio.	Richet and Cassel's masterpiece, just a riveting story of a notorious criminal who keeps the viewer equally charmed and shocked by his actions.	The film PUBLIC ENEMIES should have been. An incredible gangster epic packed with balls-to-the-wall action!	Vincent Cassel is mesmerizing in the lead role. Even if it's less focused than its predecessor, it's more fun.
"A Single Man" may at times look as carefully arranged as a fashion magazine spread, but Ford has made an elegant, compassionate movie about the broken heart beneath one tailored suit.	Whether viewers embrace its aesthetic as part of Ford's worldview or get annoyed by the fashion-spread-ishness of A Single Man's look, there's no denying the emotional impact of this superb adaptation.	A patient and never less than gripping character study that serves as a reminder of the emotional intimacy achievable on film. [Blu-ray]	While it's impossible to deny the artistic intent of Ford's cinematic compositions, his style erects an emotional barrier between the central character and the audience, resulting in a pace that is at times sluggish.	There's still a place in movies for small, literate, well-acted niche movies that focus on character. In the cinema of explosions and rampant CGI, occasionally character still matters. A Single Man has character.	Though the costumes are beautiful and the art direction impeccable, what stands out most from this debut by fashion designer Tom Ford is the leading performance by Colin Firth.
Move over Donnie Brasco. Fifty Dead Men Walking is going to put Jim Sturgess, best known for crooning in Across the Universe, on the acting map.	Gruesome scenes or torture and murder bring home the political climate once prominent in Northern Ireland.	Skogland is a crisp and efficient storyteller. She keeps the players vivid and relatively honest, and never shies away from the brutalities.	The user-used/player-pawn/Fergus-Marty relationship is what counts here, braced by Kingsley and Sturgess in a consideration of conscience in wartime.	A 'war on terror' thriller set in Ireland? Surprisingly, it works.	Though somewhat uneven in places, Fifty Dead Men Walking is a gripping portrayal of Ireland's violent history, carried by the strong performances of its lead actors.
This is an extremely well-crafted and powerful film with searing performances from the all-star cast, most notably Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.	A masterfully melancholy work with an Oscar worthy screenplay.	[An] utterly absorbing film.	It's a film worth queuing for - and you haven't been able to say that about anything with Clint's name on it in quite a while.	This is the kind of film that slowly gets under your skin, drawing you more intimately into the sad existence of the characters.	Anchored by the exceptional acting of its strong cast, Mystic River is a somber drama that unfolds in layers and conveys the tragedy of its story with visceral power.
No one takes the fun out of sex like Catherine Breillat.	Issues of sexual commitment, fidelity and self-worth are graphically explored with the torpid detachment of a psych major's filmic send-up of a Calvin Klein commercial...	A waste of cinema, and of precious time.	In her latest feature, sexual provocatrix Catherine Breillat turns a philosophical speculum on gender relations to perverse (and perversely elegant) effect.	The good news: Real-life porn star Siffredi turns out to be a terrific actor. Who knew? The bad news: The scene with the garden implement. The scene with the red cocktail. The scene with ... I can't go on.	Ponderous, pretentious, and -- considering the subject matter -- dull.
There is so much wrong with Confessions of a Shopaholic -- timing, execution, resolution and moral stance, to name a few -- that it's hard to know where to begin.	Fisher makes for a winning Cinderella, but by its third act, this hokey, old-fashioned vehicle turns back into a pumpkin.	The film serves as a defense of beauty in the face of moralism, a theme that can never go stale.	If there is a single bright spot in the financial crisis, it is the possibility that one day producer Jerry Bruckheimer will run out of money.	There may be a real credit crunch going on but this hilarious non-stop laughing spree is worth the price of a ticket.	This middling romantic comedy underutilizes a talented cast and delivers muddled messages on materialism and conspicuous consumption.
As it has evolved from a 10-minute cabaret piece, through a short film Bousman made in Toronto, to the big screen, Repo! The Genetic Opera has gained in both guts and gusto.	The lowbrow and highfalutin collide in an orgy of upscale disembowelment as director Darren Lynn Bousman gives uneasy birth to the gore opera.	All-out thriller with few Bond touches but plenty of high-octane action.	Truly, the movie doesn't gain a lot from being set to music; after about half an hour it starts to feel like a gimmick.	No, fans of "Mamma Mia!" won't be too thrilled with "Repo! The Genetic Opera."	Bombastic and intentionally gross, Repo! The Genetic Opera has a unique style but lacks the wit and substance to be involving.
Sometimes nostalgia overpowers common sense.	Nothing more than cookbook filmmaking.	I find nothing entertaining about kids screaming for two hours.	Whether it's an organ that threatens death if the wrong note is played, a wishing well that talks back to you or a pirate ship, the surface of The Goonies is all about a child's innocence and faith in the unlikely.	Persists as one of the great fables of young adult cinema not merely because it's very skilled at what it does, but because it weaves that magic into the minds and hearts of kids that serve as identifiable facets of our universal journey towards maturity.	An energetic, sometimes noisy mix of Speilbergian sentiment and funhouse tricks that will appeal to kids and nostalgic adults alike.
A bit too coy, too clever and too diffident to believe in.	It slowly but assuredly packs on the dread and the discomfort in a style that Roman Polanski would admire, resulting in the kind of movie you can feel tensing up the base of your spine.	The finest film of the 2011 Sundance film fest. One of the few films I've seen in a while that truly filled me with dread.	A stealth horror film that delves deeper into Martha's inner troubles than many filmgoers might wish to go.	An unusually unsettling experience, designed to leave you as haunted as its heroine.	Led by a mesmerizing debut performance from Elizabeth Olsen, Martha Marcy May Marlene is a distinctive, haunting psychological drama.
Funny and fun, the perfect scary movie for (younger) kids.	A great dose of horror for the whole family and one of those rare films that entertain young and old alike.	On screen, Stine's frightening characters literally come to life, but Goosebumps itself never does.	A family-friendly romp providing just the perfect blend of light-hearted humor and spine-tingling fright fare to scare and delight kids of all ages!	It's a never-boring trip to a world, where stories and imagination are powerful tools, that just might inspire kids to do the scariest thing of all: pick up a book.	Goosebumps boasts just enough of its spooky source material's kid-friendly charm to make up for the script's scattershot humor and a punishingly frantic pace.
Delirious, demented and diabolically funny.	A marvel for its invention and fury.	Full-on gore slapstick, more Tex Avery than Dario Argento.	Everything a sequel should be in terms of better but distractingly a reboot that means its predecessor should be wiped away. Two versions of the same thing by the same people is too many.	Evil Dead 2 is, pardon the expression, consistently lively -- a ghoulish splatter comedy that uses wildly excessive gore to provoke the kind of shock that lies between a laugh and a scream.	Evil Dead 2's increased special effects and slapstick-gore makes it as good -- if not better -- than the original.
An epic of feel-goodness that can't find the exit.	It's a mess, but one that's completely compelling on its own misguided, achingly sincere terms.	Dunst radiates devilish, sprightly mettle and a feisty, winsome personality that will generate a glow in the hearts of men (and older boys).	An endearing tale of a depressed young man who in the midst of career failure and a death in the family discovers the zest for life.	Four to six movies are happening simultaneously in Elizabethtown and Crowe never decides which one he should be making.	This story of a floundering shoe designer who returns home for a family tragedy gets lost in undeveloped plot lines and lackluster performances.
This is a good film to see once, but we aren't sure you are going to want to watch it again and again.	Because Adams and Blunt bring their best to the roles, the feature carefully avoids the pitfalls of convention, becoming a familiar story executed with unexpected gravitas.	Alan Arkin gives another quirky performance.	This is nearly a decent family comedy - but like the mantra-chuntering character Adams plays, it's just not confident enough of its strong points to really stand out.	Although the film isn't brilliant, the script has its moments and includes some memorable dialogue: "How'd she die?" "It was a do-it-yourself kinda thing."	Despite a sometimes overly familiar plot, Sunshine Cleaning benefits from the lively performances of its two stars.
Plays like a very special episode of The OC.	My screening presented the final reel upside down and backward; no difference whatsoever.	Yes, it's a great premise, but the execution was very weak.	There are some intriguing ideas running around in The Invisible, but they never amount to much.	Teen angst is teen angst whether it's DOA or MIA, and c'mon, if you really want to go all Swede-emo on us, you're always going to run up against the immovable cinematic woegasm that was Ingmar Bergman. Never a smart move, that.	Dull and confusing execution makes this ghost story utterly forgettable and unintentionally funny.
Like all great films about a life you never knew existed, it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame.	The film uses standard techniques to tell its tale ... but does so with integrity and attention to detail.	A documentary that is stirring and enlightening.	Filmmakers Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann area headed east, Far East, in retelling a historically significant, and personal, episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of German Jewish refugees while the world's democracie	The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors, whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday.	Explores a little-known piece of Holocaust history, weaving together stories of overlapping cultures and their coexistence under the pretext of a war to create a touching and unusual narrative.
It's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie, directed by Scott Kalvert, about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches, gratuitous violence, or empty machismo.	Flat and uninspired, it merely begins at point A, travels through a series of gang-film cliches, and ends at point B.	No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie.	When you're watching a flick like this and you're expecting -- no, make that hoping -- someone's gonna bust out with a chorus of Maria, then you're in pretty bad shape.	It hasn't got a clue where it's going, or which movie it wants to copy most.	Melodramatic and weighted down with silly dialogue, Deuces Wild is a forgettable, overheated thriller that leaves no cliche unturned.
Based on Henry James' story Turn of the Screw this catches an eerie, spine-chilling mood right at the start and never lets up on its grim, evil theme.	An elegant, sinister and scalp-prickling ghost story - as scary in its way as Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist.	This classy English mystery is adorned by a wonderful Deborah Kerr as the governess driven to extremes by a strange, haunted mansion and strange, haunted children,	Kerr is on top form here, enacting a role that takes perfect advantage of her respectable facade wrestling with unspeakable turbulence beneath the surface.	One of cinema's great ghost stories is also an essay on the psychological realities of film acting.	Creepily atmospheric, The Innocents is a stylishly crafted, chilling British ghost tale with Deborah Kerr at her finest.
It's a thrill to see that some movie stars can still do it all... exhausting, exhilerating stuff.	Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon will likely be nominated for Oscars for their phenomenal performances as Johnny Cash and June Carter in Walk the Line.	A dash more authentic--or, at least, more subtle--than its Hollywood spawning and Taylor Hackford's come-on-strong take on [Ray] Charles would seem to predict.	A mighty fine piece of work.	Joaquin Phoenix isn't Johnny Cash. But with the clip-clop of rhythms behind him, aiming his guitar like a gun, he puts on one sensational show.	Superior acting and authentic crooning capture the emotional subtleties of the legend of Johnny Cash with a freshness that is a pleasure to watch.
In the end, like the instantly-forgettable title, it's kind of neither one thing nor the other and certainly no match for the likes of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Girl, Interrupted.	This boy doesn't need therapy or happy pills but a large slap round the chops.	I'm pretty sure if I'd seen this movie when I was 17, I would have loved it.	Throw in solid performances, a terrific script with witty and spot-on dialogue, and plenty of creative directorial flourishes and this comes off as a winning offering. (Parental Review also Available)	Respected indie filmmakers with a niche in social-realist drama try their hand at winsome comedy, fall flat on their critically acclaimed faces.	It's amiable, and it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping psych ward comedy cliches, but given its talented cast and directors, It's Kind of a Funny Story should be more than just mildly entertaining.
Reeves, with his beguilingly blank face and loose-limbed, happy-go-lucky physical vocabulary, and Winter, with his golden curls, gleefully good vibes and 'bodacious' vocabulary, propel this adventure as long as they can.	More than anything, the picture looks paltry and undernourished. Even the warts on Lincoln's face look slapped on.	Pretty funny even it embarasses you to admit it	Airheaded but funny movie. I actually liked "Bogus Journey" better, though.	A nonstop giggle from start to finish, this beguiling grab-bag of time-travel clichés, hard-rock music and Valley-speaking cool dudes is a flawless, purpose-built junk movie.	Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just charming, goofy, and silly enough to make this fluffy time-travel Adventure work.
Both filthier and funnier than Broken Lizard's prior efforts, Beerfest is still decidedly hit-or-miss.	Beerfest might not be your cup of tea -- or mug of pilsener -- but fans of the group's earlier movies (Super Troopers and Club Dread) know what to expect: cleverly construed bad taste.	The funniest movie of the summer.	Any filmgoer off the street could head into this one dry and still find something hard to laugh at.	Ok, so maybe you don't absolutely have to have a Y chromosome and be 14 years old (or have the mind of a 14-year-old) to appreciate the freshmanic humor that is Beerfest. But, oh, does it help.	Beerfest features some laugh-inducing gags, but is too long and the pacing too uneven to form a coherent, functioning comedy.
Se puede ver si se toma como la tнpica pelнcula dominguera para pasar un rato sentado en la oscuridad de una sala de cine, pero no ofrece nada mбs.	Witherspoon is perfectly cast.	It's only funny in fits and spurts, and the story takes a ludicrous, unbelievable turn toward the end.	...Misses a plum opportunity to be the post-Marilyn blonde movie...	Thanks to a razor-sharp performance by Reese Witherspoon, this movie produces a lot more entertainment than its paper-thin premise deserves.	Though the material is predictable and formulaic, Reese Witherspoon's funny, nuanced performance makes this movie better than it would have been otherwise.
Step Into Liquid is a great title for a surfing documentary, and the movie, written, edited, and directed by Dana Brown, lives up to that trippy sensual promise.	Essentially a long, handsomely filmed infomercial, it never removes its trembling lips from surfing's bronzed posterior, but it delivers enough of the goods visually that the choir it's preaching to shouldn't mind.	There are some novelties, like views of people surfing down sand dunes, but there's also far too much self-congratulation by surfers.	A wonderful commercial for everything that makes surfing so enjoyable for many people.	"Step Into Liquid" is not a documentary so much as a love letter from director Dana Brown to his sport of surfing.	A perfect companion piece to The Endless Summer.
[Butler] caught the tense moments at NASA as scientists waited to see whether the robots would land safely. And he got amazing pictures from them of the red surface of Mars pocked with what may be dried-up lake basins and riverbeds.	The movie is more compelling than exciting with one exception: the kind of rocket blast-off sequence for which IMAX screens were seemingly invented.	Not having a way to capture images of the machines at work means that too much of Butler's film ... is disappointingly made up of computer simulations.	The actual images from the barren surface of our solar neighbor don't fill the giant screen.	Why shouldn't the movie be gung-ho about it all? Those plucky little robots, Spirit and Opportunity, have been up there for almost two years now, and they're still sending back dazzling pictures and illuminating data.	Roving Mars is a decent thrill ride even when it starts feeling like a commercial plug for NASA's failing space program.
Alastair Sim's performance in Dickens' hoary holiday classic provided one of the defining moments of his career; the result is the definitive filming of the story, breathing life into the familiar plot while earnestly hewing to the author's vision.	One of the handful of best Christmas movies ever made.	Lashings of festive cheer and a fair dollop of fine performances will leave you in the mood for mince pies and a renewed sense of seasonal goodwill to all men.	This faithful adaptation of Dickens' A Christmas Carol is a rare beast indeed, a genuinely affecting melodrama.	You have what Scrooge himself might call 'Ho-hum-bug.'	The 1951 adaptation of Charles Dickens' timeless classic is perhaps the most faithful film version -- and Alastair Sim's performance as Scrooge is not to be missed.
The idyllic but mundane world of the film's opening segues smoothly into a sequence out of a highly intelligent slasher film, before finally settling into its niche as a darkly funny, and at times mildly disturbing, sci-fi thriller.	A super-low-budget genre exercise from Spain, writer-director Nacho Vigalondo's extremely watchable work has long-running cult status written all over it.	The modest satisfactions of Timecrimes come down to a protagonist divided against himself.	His film is satisfying in its clever construction and vivid style.	As a director, Vigalondo sweeps you up into his tale and keeps you running at what seems like full speed toward the finish line.	Timecrimes is a low-budget thriller that's well-crafted and loaded with dark humor and bizarre twists.
[Evans is] a fascinating character, and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie.	A whole lot of fun.	This is classic Hollywood, at its best and worst, sticky rich and scabrous.	A colorful and captivating biography... So sly and mischievously engaging that at times you feel like it could be the first movie to actually buy you drinks and shag you silly.	Despite some reservations, this is an interesting and excellent documentary...	Though not objective by any means, The Kid Stays in the Picture is irresistibly entertaining.
This remarkable first feature by Ondi Timoner transcends its subject matter by engaging our emotions and making us care about the likes of Anton Newcombe, even if we don't like him very much.	Utilizando imagens capturadas ao longo de sete anos, Timoner cria um autęntico (e fascinante) arco narrativo, estabelecendo brilhantemente a trajetória de seus anti-heróis.	Most of the movie gets its interest from musicians overestimating their own importance.	An electrifying and poignant double biography of two west coast bands...a sort of rock equivalent of 'Hoop Dreams,' substituting music for basketball.	Through that mixture of luck and diligence that makes the best documentaries, Timoner offers a resonant, often painfully funny, drama about two good friends who become enemies against the backdrop of the pop-music business.	So you wanna be a rock 'n' roll star? Dig! compellingly chronicles the ups and downs of the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre, two ambitious bands whose love/hate relationship embodies many of the potential pratfalls of the music business.
Shame feels like the first real Fassbender vehicle in that it hinges entirely on him and his minute facial reactions and (especially) on the constant workout of his body walking and running through space.	Lower your expectations.Scene for scene, effectively intense, with fierce performances, but McQueen sets up a narrative and never follows through.Why are these people damaged?	Many may hail Shame as a voyeuristic masterpiece when in fact it's an empty provocation verging on the ludicrous.	Shame may not feel like it carries as much immediate weight or impact as Hunger but considering how much is left open for interpretation, it ends up being just as thought-provoking.	Shame could have gone all wrong with the wrong actor. Luckily, McQueen has the right one in Fassbender, and that makes all the difference.	Boasting stellar performances by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, Shame is a powerful plunge into the mania of addiction affliction.
Never surprising but always agreeable, Tom Vaughan's Starter for 10 bops along like a hummable tune.	Starter for 10 has a light touch and keeps sentiment mostly at bay.	Quiz show aptly shows that wisdom is preferably to knowledge.	I liked the actors and the tone, I loved the music here, but throughout the film I had a feeling of cinematic déjŕ vu.	It is uniformly well acted, but the cast deserves better than this prepackaged, artificially preserved concoction.	Starter For 10 is a spirited coming-of-age tale that remains charming and witty even as it veers into darker teritory. The unique setting of a quiz show makes the film wittier than your average romantic comedy.
There is a lot of graphic violence in A Man Apart, but there is little with the super-charged tension Gray strives for.	The movie has more than its share of action scenes, but they're grafted onto a gritty crime drama that has no room for outsized heroics.	The force of the filmmaking has gravitas and conviction -- pay attention to anything that's going on, and first you wonder where the hell the mood came from, and then you feel used by it.	This is disappointingly routine stuff from Gray, but the movie does boast one disaster area of a shoot-out and a nifty denouement.	Despite an interesting take on the role of a tough guy, [A Man Apart] is a boring and visually annoying rouge cop story.	Action and drama elements don't mix well in this clichйd actioner.
while The Muppet Movie is certainly entertaining, the shift to a coherent, linear, feature-length narrative deprives the film the show's brilliantly structured inanity	Sure, a pig and a frog are an unlikely couple, but who isn't? This film reminds us that we are loved, regardless of whether we roll in the mud or swallow flies.	The Best Muppet movie ever made...well, almost.	Jolson sang, Barrymore spoke, Garbo laughed, and now Kermit the Frog rides a bicycle... If you can figure out how they were able to show Kermit pedaling across the screen, then you are less a romantic than I am: I prefer to believe he did it himself.	What in the world can you say about this? The purest, funniest and most endearing Muppet flick--it's simply the pinnacle of extant evidence we have to the genius of Henson and those he surrounded himself with. Highly recommended.	The Muppet Movie, the big-screen debut of Jim Henson's plush creations, is smart, lighthearted, and fun for all ages.
The whole film is a great piece of eye candy with many LA sites and a lot of music and action.	Transgressions can be overlooked thanks to cast members so cool they make the title feel like a mantra.	Enervated sequels full of witless in-jokes shouldn't lob stones at enervated sequels full of witless in-jokes.	Feels forced and graceless. It's like a clumsy dancer who can't keep up with the sprightly beat being set by the band.	Be Cool is anything but. A follow-up to the charming comedy Get Shorty, it's one of the weakest sequels in recent memory.	Be Cool is tepid, square, and lukewarm; as a parody of the music business, it has two left feet.
Anyone should be fascinated by the thoroughness and all-around intelligence this documentary applies to a multilayered and very entertaining subject.	This is an entertaining visit to a strange planet.	A smart, highly entertaining piece of cinema-reportage.	Gives a strong impression of the atmosphere, excitement and complexity of a Broadway production.	It's all conveyed with an evenhanded, often affectionate tone. Even [Rosie] O'Donnell comes off sympathetically.	Made with obvious care and attention, Showbusiness is an entertaining, insightful look into Broadway.
The Next Three Days is perfunctory fare that seems to last almost as long as its title.	Crisply acted, smartly directed and patently absurd, The Next Three Days is a high-tension thriller wound so tight it seems ready to snap like a stressed guitar string at any minute.	A name filmmaker and star trying with all their might to pump a slender genre flick into an Oscar-caliber action-drama -- and failing.	Haggis has a case of tunnel-vision in The Next Three Days, a sense that nothing extraneously lofty will get in the way.	It's damn hard to enjoy a thriller when you don't, won't, can't believe a word of it.	Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks give it their all, but their solid performances aren't quite enough to compensate for The Next Three Days' uneven pace and implausible plot.
A gory, slapdash entry that ditches some of the somberness of its predecessors, yet again finds its narrative adventurousness drowned out by flat staging and unimaginative direction.	Saw 3D is the dumbest and most illogical entry in the Saw series -- quite an accomplishment, given that the Saw movies are the dumbest, most illogical series of horror films of the millennium.	The ostensibly final movie in the increasingly preposterous Saw series offers neither much drama nor horror, unfortunately for audiences.	One can only hope that someone or something kills off this series before 4D becomes the theater circuit rage. (Parental Review Also Available)	The 3D is bad. The acting is bad. The kills and torture sequences are mediocre. The ending is underwhelming. Do you really want to spend $15 dollars to see this movie?	Sloppily filmed, poorly acted, and illogically plotted, Saw 3D leaves viewers trapped in the most lackluster installment of the series.
Deuce Bigalow, like the SNL routines it models itself after, starts off funny but doesn't know when to end.	Rob Schneider, its star, and Adam Sandler, its producer, keep finding new and wondrous answers to that limbo stick question, 'How low can you go?'	A scattershot movie where you sit and wait for that next two minutes of funny stuff which often never comes.	The jokes are unabashedly pitched at 12-year-old boys, with flatulence, masturbation and excretions as the leading themes.	A couple of these situations are funny, a few are real clunkers, and it all fades away like a slightly bad odor.	According to critics, Deuce Bigalow is just too dumb and filled with old, tired gags.
After a summer of phony, pasty rom-coms, do this: See a movie where old-fashioned notions of love, faith, strength, and the possibility of redemption are taken seriously.	Too pat by a half during the finale, but Tyler Perry shows a maturity as a filmmaker that would pave the way for arguably his best picture, 2010's "For Colored Girls."	Tyler Perry does good all by himself, but having Henson on board helps.	Tyler Perry's latest hodgepodge has its moments.	Not a very good movie, but it has some sincerely positive ideas, and those ideas almost make up for the fact that it's not a very good movie.	Though somewhat formulaic and predictable, Perry succeeds in mixing broad humor with sincere sentimentality to palatable effect.
Many will probably wish the film was as good and inspired as Murphy's performance.	Murphy's targets are selective, his timing shrewd.	Jokes that are funny the first time are repeated over and over, well past the point where they stop being funny, and far into the realm of annoyance.	The movie is dismaying enough; thinking about its huge potential audience is downright terrifying.	Builds on the potential of its predecessor yet simultaneously leaves us wanting more	While Eddie Murphy is still hilarious as the entire Klump family, the movie falls apart because of uneven pacing, a poor script, and skits that rely on being gross rather than funny.
Dan Krauss finds a new angle on the nightmarish story.	A military platoon bent on murdering Afghan civilians for pleasure is the target of this chillingly frank documentary.	"The Kill Team" is emotionally heavy; as you watch, you feel conflicted about Winfield's role and about your own perception of right and wrong.	This chilling war-is-hell expose [is] must-see viewing.	The film is weak on its essential indictment, vaguely suggesting a mood of battlefield boredom without quite pinpointing the pathology that would lead military men to squeeze the trigger pell-mell.	Urgent, mesmerizing, and infuriating, The Kill Team looks at American foreign policy from a rarely considered perspective.
Sexy, scary and fearlessly subversive.	The film is so stylishly shot, and performed with such swagger, that it transcends its own pretentiousness.	Though alluring, enjoyable and well-crafted, when all is digested its strangeness seems as empty of substance as cotton candy.	While the oblique narrative can test the patience, there are moments of artful beauty that make it worth some attention.	As seductive and forebodding as its title -- a simple, declarative sentence that encompasses many mysteries -- Ana Lily Amirpour's debut feature reanimates and restores the sexiness of the vampire movie.	A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night blends conventional elements into something brilliantly original -- and serves as a striking calling card for writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour.
This zany comedy written and directed by Tamara Jenkins is filled with humorous takes on sexuality in the 1970s.	Raucous, poignant and hilariously frank about the ins and outs of budding female sexuality.	Really, it sounds more intriguing than it is. Nothing really happens.	An ingenious mixture of (so to speak) broad comedy and poignance.	What lifts this brash comedy above the vulgar herd is Tamara Jenkins in a heartfelt feature debut as writer and director.	Warm, real, and hilarious.
Silly teens-versus-aliens adventure is sure to delight kids.	Small pleasures aside, the movie doesn't offer anything particularly memorable or inventive.	For the youngsters, it offers a lot of fun -- and it's funny.	Aliens In The Attic is a movie solely aimed at children and it does exactly what it sets out to do. It's nothing more than a harmless comedy for kids and tweenagers chock full of slapstick comedy, cute-as-pie aliens and appealing child stars.	This is one of those once-seen-immediately-forgotten enterprises which avoids anything memorable or imaginative in favour of fast, functional, charisma-free busy-ness.	Inoffensive and kid-friendly this mundane family comedy is light on imagination.
A film that aspires to do two things at once, but ends up doing not much at all.	The movie is filmed with an honest sensuality, and it never overplays its hand when it comes to the erotic parts.	An affecting coming-of-age story.	More cringesome than cute.	An artful, entertaining film.	Malena ends up objectifying the character of the movie's title. Also, the young boy's emotional investment with Malena is never convincing, as she doesn't feel like a three-dimensional person.
Two hours later I felt as if I was heartless, as all this film did was make me wish I had the last two hours back even after all the melodramatic pain and suffering.	As manufactured Disease of the Week weepies go, Nick Cassavetes's drama based on a Jodi Picoult bestseller, is surprisingly moving.	Keeper, striving to manipulate the audience, goes on a little longer than it should. However, the performances are so true that it's easy to forgive such unneeded, straight-to-the-heartstrings tactics.	An awkwardly structured but warmly emotional and relatively unsentimental drama.	An adaptation that, although departing dramatically from such key elements as the book's ending, will please fans.	My Sister's Keeper gets fine performances from its adult and child actors, but the director's heavy-handed approach turns a worthy emotional subject into an overly melodramatic tearjerker.
Unfortunately, though its heart is smack in the right place, The Greatest tends to play more like a collection of appropriate, well-acted scenes than as a fully satisfying narrative.	The Greatest takes a piece out of you.	Marvelous when it settles into a hushed mood of introspection and unspoken personal connection; a sweeping feeling of sea change reflected through a trio of splendid actors.	A smart, finely wrought tale that will have you choked up and nodding your head at the same time...It's about much more than simply triggering the audience's tear ducts.	Perhaps the best compliment to give it is that it never comes off as a weepy Lifetime movie. The acting and writing are too good to let that happen.	It's burdened by a predictable, overly melodramatic story, but The Greatest benefits from strong performances by its talented cast.
A disappointing and uninspiring animated feature.	A visually breathtaking film!	Tedious, self-important and at times exhausting!	It turns much too serious for its own good, though it otherwise is an entirely satisfying animated adventure story.	This is truly a landmark in animated entertainment.	The Prince of Egypt's stunning visuals and first-rate voice cast more than compensate for the fact that it's better crafted than it is emotionally involving.
It is strongly and competently told, and the poignancy of warriors stricken by the sound of Stille Nacht floating across the trenches still has the power to move.	This true story seems like it can only be explained as 'a God thing,' and indeed, how else could something so extraordinary take place without divine intervention?	Saber que o espetacular incidente relatado pelo longa realmente aconteceu é algo que, confesso, me reconforta imensamente.	It isn't exactly All Quiet on the Western Front or Oh! What a Lovely War. What it lacks is proper finesse.	Well-photographed and acted, Joyeux Noël suffers most from the inevitable comparison with its betters, such films as Paths of Glory or All Quiet on the Western Front.	The poignant humanity on display in Joyeux Noel makes its sentimentality forgivable.
Deeply affecting in the moment, but I'm not sure that Garbus draws much in the way of larger conclusions.	Garbus's follow-up to 2002's The Execution of Wanda Jean provides another powerful glimpse inside the American justice system.	Chilling, depressing, yet guardedly optimistic.	Like many similar documentaries, this 2002 feature doesn't present easy answers, but by letting the two girls register as individuals, it forces the viewer to care about them when few around them can be bothered.	In the end, the girls' stories are inspiring and heartbreaking, making this sensitively directed film one of the most rewarding of the year.	An intimate, compassionate look at two teenagers in juvenile hall.
Nearly wordless and devoid of comforting context, and driven by composer Mica Levi's haunting and discordant score, Under the Skin will drill deep and lay eggs in your brain.	The protagonist's process repeats itself over and over again, and each time ... we're simultaneously certain of and baffled by the whole thing.	Under the Skin manages to fulfill the promise of its prologue, burrowing under the viewer's skin without pretense, or the benefit of Laura's bedside manner.	A striking attempt to tell an exotic story in a down-to-earth environment that deserves praise for its singularity of vision, even as it runs the risk of ridicule.	This is a brave and fascinating film that is at once surreal yet depicts a world we know all too well.	Its message may prove elusive for some, but with absorbing imagery and a mesmerizing performance from Scarlett Johansson, Under the Skin is a haunting viewing experience.
One of the most harrowing of anti-war statements, and the most beautiful too.	The Thin Red Line would have been infinitely more successful without the frequent rest-stops full of mental malaise and philosophical pretense.	At two hours and 45 minutes, The Thin Red Line gives ample evidence of suffering all manner of cuts, if not having been simply hacked into its final shape. But this violence only adds to the movie's brave, strange, eroded nobility.	A haunting, scattered reminiscence piece, where the mind is allowed to drift through its memories, and retrieve impressions of the beautiful and the hideous, the serene and the hysterical, the banal and the profound.	One of the best war movies ever made!	The Thin Red Line is a daringly philosophical World War II film with an enormous cast of eager stars.
At best, Priest is a passable time-waster. Mostly, it's like watching an extended Gorillaz video.	Drab, eye-rollingly stupid and with noisy effects designed to drown out audience snores, Priest is just about as bad as it gets.	A dourly humourless, futuristic farrago.	Vampires, cowboys and warrior priests: an unholy mess.	At $12.75 a movie ticket, you might be better off buying the comic book.	Sleek and stylish, but those qualities are wasted on a dull, derivative blend of sci-fi, action, and horror.
A keenly observed and ferociously realistic somber political drama about an illegal abortion in the Romania of 1987.	Tense, kinetic, intelligent and real.	Not a film that's easy to watch, but it is one of remarkable power...a searing indictment of a society gone wrong as well as a harrowing personal story.	[Anamaria Marinca's] convincing performance as the clearly conflicted Otilia holds our interest throughout the film.	A grinding, expertly crafted slice of Eastern European miserablism... an unquestionably overpowering experience that nonetheless left this reviewer with a nagging sense of unease.	Featuring gut-wrenching performances from Anamaria Marinca and Laura Vasiliu, 4 Months is a gripping portrayal of life in Communist Romania.
Quick and to the point when it comes to delivering scares.	Midway through, the plot blows a gasket and the camerawork turns altogether crazed, joggling us about in the semi-darkness while the soundtrack rings to distorted screams.	Not since John Carpenter's one-shot intro to Halloween has POV horror been this good.	A brilliantly staged early scare signals that the safety rails are off and, despite an unexpected, last-minute swerve into the supernatural realm, the edge-of-the-seat tension is sustained to the very last second.	An unexceptional workout for the adrenaline glands nudged up several notches by a climax that will cause muchos trouser trauma to all but the recently deceased.	Plunging viewers into the nightmarish hellscape of an apartment complex under siege, [Rec] proves that found footage can still be used as an effective delivery mechanism for sparse, economic horror.
Back to the Future meets Rebel Without a Cause.	A brilliant and truly incredible piece of art that deserves to be watched...	One fee-yucked up movie.	If this movie ever figured out what it wanted to be when it grows up, it would be a terrific one.	If the sum total of Donnie Darko is hard to figure, there's no questioning that its separate scenes add up to breathtaking filmmaking.	Richard Kelly's debut feature Donnie Darko is a daring, original vision, packed with jarring ideas and intelligence and featuring a remarkable performance from Jake Gyllenhaal as the troubled title character.
Surrogate motherhood is the comic topic of the day, and this is one funny chick flick that won't rankle male members of the audience.	Steve Martin emerges as Baby Mama's mack daddy.	There are a couple of minor surprises and enough laughs and truisms floating around the supporting cast to make this an easy comedy to watch.	The film's talented performers are wasted thanks to a weak script.	Fey and Poehler deliver more laughs than the last two Will Ferrell movies combined	Baby Mama is a lightweight, predictable comedy that ekes by on the strength of its performers.
A sleek, handsomely made bauble buoyed by a cast much stronger than the flimsy material deserves.	Despite some clever early fantasy scenes, Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's adaptation of best seller The Nanny Diaries won't make Bridget Jones give up her writing.	This is supposed to be satire. But it is satire that behaves so predictably it isn't worth studying.	The Nanny Diaries ultimately feels emotionally true to itself.	The conclusion is desperately trite, but Linney's performance helps this comedy - based on a novel by two nannies, take note - feel like a credible peek behind very expensive curtains.	The Nanny Diaries' miscast lead and unrealistic, one-dimensional characters make this class satire far less effective than it should've been.
A surprisingly witty script, some really excellent chemistry between Douglas & Turner, and a large (and very welcome) portion of comic relief by Danny DeVito. Fun stuff.	Its combination of romance and adventure (and a bit of comedy) was spot-on, and few films that have arrived since have captured Stone's enthusiasm and good-naturedness	The message is clear: Love and protection comes with a white face and a big, black gun. His name is Michael Douglas.	After all the Raiders rip-offs, it's fun to find an adventure film that deserves the comparison, that has the same spirit and sense of humor.	A grand example of the rarest combination of adventure, humor, and sexual chemistry which all crackle along with abandon.	Romancing the Stone reaches back to the classic Saturday morning serials of old with an action-filled adventure enlivened by the sparkling chemistry between its well-matched leads.
The film overflows with the studied ordinariness that prevails in Mom movies, where glamorous Hollywood stars muck about in pajamas and a little epiphany may be signaled by a broken cereal bowl on the kitchen floor.	An accomplished film that continually takes us beyond our first impressions of people and situations.	Too many situations are set up or suggested without much follow-through.	Much of A Map of the World is comparable to the work of Fritz Lang, Paul Schrader or any other filmmaker skilled at evoking panic and self-loathing.	Good performances all through the movie.	Disjointed storytelling overshadows noteworthy performances.
Little more than a creepy B-movie with art-house trimmings.	An evolutionary leap from a true master of his craft.	Only someone as talented as Almodóvar could have mixed such elements without blowing up an entire movie.	Pedro Almodovar's latest outrage against propriety is a body horror comedy, a sort of mash-up of the work of David Cronenberg and The Rocky Horror Picture Show	Banderas has never been better. He's a brilliant actor, and obviously Almodovar recognized that he is perfect for this role.	The Skin I Live In lacks Almodovar's famously charged romance, replaced with a wonderfully bizarre and unpredictable detour into arthouse ick.
Numbingly pedestrian.	Part romance, part horror movie, there isn't much chocolate in Blood and Chocolate, and there isn't really much blood, either, in this less-than-thrilling thriller.	...the film's positives are ultimately outweighed by its negatives.	A truly laughable movie, one that takes itself far too seriously without ever taking a moment to consider who its audience is -- or if it even has one.	There isn't enough absinthe in all of Romania to obliterate the taste of this clunker.	Cheap CG effects and laughable dialogue make Blood and Chocolate worse than the usual werewolf flick.
Although its computer-generated imagery is impressive, the major surprise of this bright foray into a new kind of animation is how much cleverness has been invested in story and dialogue.	Revolutionized animation, and had a great story, to boot!	The film sports a provocative and appealing story that's every bit the equal of this technical achievement.	Remains a groundbreaking work in the field of animation, and is still a wonderfully entertaining film.	A children's film that has real staying power.	Entertaining as it is innovative, Toy Story reinvigorated animation while heralding the arrival of Pixar as a family-friendly force to be reckoned with.
Resembles one of those giddy road pictures of the '40s that starred Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, where the stars would look straight at the camera and crack wise about real people.	It's a merry surfeit, lofted by calisthenic wow above the usual level for late-era Jackie and Wilson's mellow-gold delivery.	Except for some doubles, Chan performs his fight scenes in this film live on camera while doing his most creative choreography in years.	If you're gonna insist on making a distressingly formulaic sequel to a distressingly formulaic comedy, then this might be the way to go, by overstuffing it with so much nonsensical material that some of it is bound to charm through sheer willpower.	This time around, Chan and Wilson find their characters in London and all over the turn-of-the-century English countryside... trampling through history and literature, putting a spin on Jack the Ripper and others as well... Fans of the original "Shanghai	A silly, anachronistic mess, but the pairing of Chan and Wilson makes the movie fun.
There are plentiful perilous countdowns, most of the set-pieces are impressively mounted and, in its own silly way, the pay-off offers a glancing blow at US foreign policy. Relatable? No. But quite fun.	Lacking Bond's refinement and good humor or the comparable realism of the Bourne Identity franchise, M:I 3 ends up as just another forgettable action movie.	If it takes 6 years for such a socko fix for the action-adventure addict, better wait than be sorry.	Here we are again for a third jog around Mission Impossible track and it's turning into a very tired experience.	On the build Mission 3 is urgent and addictive, but when closing the deal it's contrived and predictable.	Fast-paced, with eye-popping stunts and special effects, the latest Mission: Impossible installment delivers everything an action fan could ask for. A thrilling summer popcorn flick.
As Hitler, Bruno Ganz ignites the screen with every appearance: his rages against traitors and betrayal (perceived and real) are delivered with ugly conviction ....	It's reach exceeds its grasp; nonetheless, a compelling study of Hitler's last days.	...an unflinching, hard, relentlessly honest movie that refuses to ask questions that have easy answers. It is also brilliantly acted, written and focused...	What Downfall has going for it is a once-in-a-lifetime performance from Bruno Ganz.	...a serious and useful film in that it reminds us that the capacity for evil is a human trait.	Downfall is an illuminating, thoughtful and detailed account of Hitler's last days.
Jake Gyllenhaal is better than the sum of Nightcrawler's parts, but the film is still a riveting, horrific exploitation that blurs the lines between American greed and the American dream.	The way [Gyllenhaal] toggles between empty stares and blabbermouthed 'charm' when confronting his prey is reminiscent of no less than Scarlett Johnasson in 'Under the Skin.'	There's not an ounce of fat on the film. It gets in, it tells the story as well as it possibly can, and it cuts out perfectly.	A fantastic, sleek and fun satire.	Switch off that television and head out to the cinema: Gyllenhaal is sensational headlining a pitch-black satire with its finger on the pulse.	Restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler offers dark, thought-provoking thrills.
The genre thrills are as potent as the story's themes ...	Drug War becomes both weightier and more playful with each transition, building to a harrowing finale.	Like a cross between "The Wire" and "The French Connection," even if To's blood-drenched fatalism goes a little overboard by the end. Despite the familiarity, it's an impressive piece of work.	A sizzling crime melodrama seemingly inspired by "The French Connection". The best Hong Kong movie I have seen in years even remarkably filmed in China.	An almost incongruously exciting effort from Johnnie To...	A taut, solidly constructed action thriller with uncommon intelligence, Drug War delivers exhilarating set pieces without skimping on sophisticated filmmaking.
Trouble The Water tells a fascinating story with some amazing imagery, shot when the floods were at their height, but somehow loses something in the translation.	Trouble the Water is choppy, overly long and at times almost indecipherable, but it's indelible.	Trouble the Water's political-made-personal power to invoke both Anderson Cooper levels of rage and the sense that hope springs eternal rests solely with its main subjects.	There have been many good documentaries about Katrina...but "Trouble the Water" is the best of the bunch, a personal, ground's eye view told with outrage, humor, strength and song by the unforgettable Kimberley Roberts	Trouble the Water's greatest of its many values is its incisive record of how a massive catastrophe is really a story of multiple individuals, families, blocks and neighborhoods.	This incredible documentary displays the tragedy and mismanagement of Katrina along with the heroism of strangers and survivors.
An engaging and generous-spirited romantic comedy.	In an age when self-acceptance and taking a hold of one's destiny is more relevant than ever, Big Eden may be the right inspirational movie for our evolving times.	When you lay it on too thick, the audience is distracted by implausibility rather than identifying with the characters.	Warm and fuzzy.	Without any true motivation for this love to develop, it's hard to truly believe Bezucha's gay fairy tale.	Though unrealistic, Big Eden has all the charm and sweetness of a fairy tale.
The happy ending had me on my feet cheering throughout the final credits. I can't wait to see it again.	Loving tribute to silent films has a few tense moments.	Anchored by the wildly charming Dujardin in the lead, The Artist is so warm and entertaining, it will leave you speechless. And smiling.	Possibly one of the most joyously enjoyable films to screen in the Cannes competition -- especially for lovers of classic Hollywood cinema -- The Artist is a real pleasure.	Its retro-retro take uniquely delivers the most crucial element of the moviegoing experience, the art of entertainment.	A crowd-pleasing tribute to the magic of silent cinema, The Artist is a clever, joyous film with delightful performances and visual style to spare.
An eye-ravishing meditation on first love, squandered talent, the eternal beauty of Rome and a life wasted on hedonistic excess.	This is quite simply glorious filmmaking.	The comparisons to Fellini have been plentiful, but The Great Beauty is very much its own thing.	A VIP tour of a secret, horribly fashionable world that one wouldn't want to linger in yet can't help but find fascinating.	Plays at times like a more conventional, less daring version of 1972’s Roma...On its own merits, Sorrentino’s film ain’t half-bad, but it’s no Fellini picture.	Dazzlingly ambitious, beautifully filmed, and thoroughly enthralling, The Great Beauty offers virtuoso filmmaking from writer/director Paolo Sorrentino.
A positive and personal look at the Israel/ Palestine divide through the quest of one woman to maintain her own property.	A genuinely absorbing, compelling and wise drama with a well-nuanced, radiant and moving performance by Hiam Abbass, the heart and soul of the film.	Lemon Tree is a wrenching, richly layered feminist allegory as well as a geopolitical one.	The pungence of Lemon Tree is in the surreal moments that capture the pervasive unease in Gaza, and in the quiet strength of Abbass' performance.	Writer-director Eran Riklis handles these questions subtly and thoughtfully, tying the little struggle over the trees to larger issues without turning "Lemon Tree" into a parable.	A positive and personal Israeli film that offers an understated and thought-provoking vision of the West Bank troubles.
At 105 minutes it's exhausting, even though it has been expertly cut together.	We are introduced to the alchemists who looked at a talented little kid, saw dollar signs, and turned him into pure gold. Somehow, director Jon Chu is able to make their success not seem exploitative.	It's a given that Justin Bieber's millions of prepubescent girl fans are ill-equipped arbiters of taste. So it goes that this faux documentary is nothing more or less than a 105 minute marketing campaign for the latest teenybopper flavor.	It has come to this: parents who have recorded their children's lives since infancy can see their home films edited into their child's very own 3-D concert documentary.	This concert film is designed as a marketing tool to make Bieber a bigger global star, but given that, you can observe his charm, ambition and talent, and recognize that he is the first teen idol totally created by the new technologies and social media	As a tour documentary, it's rather uninspired -- but as a 3D glimpse of a building pop culture phenomenon, Never Say Never is undeniably entertaining.
If you go to a movie called Ninja Assassin--mayhem is what you signed up for. If you expected Crouching Tiger, then please check your meds.	Once upon a time, James McTeigue made V for Vendetta, a thinking-person's revenge melodrama. He's paying for that with Ninja Assassin.	When a movie's first scene shows one thug getting the top of his head sliced off and another being chopped diagonally in half, you know you're not in for much of a dramatic crescendo.	Nothing more than an excuse for violent ninja fighting with a huge body count and plenty of blood - real and CGI.	Uncertain of what it wants to be, Ninja Assassin will likely disappoint action fans with excessive CGI gore, and gore fans with excessive uninspired action.	Overly serious and incomprehensibly edited, Ninja Assassin fails to live up to the promise of its title.
Trust Stanley Kubrick to make a sex movie with absolutely no sexual heat but instead with ideas that haunt you.	Kubrick fans would do wisely to sit back, take a deep breath, and just appreciate Eyes Wide Shut for what the film is -- a departed master's final gift. We will never see the likes of it again.	Kubrick's swansong is disturbing, audacious and criminally underrated.	Finally, however, it's just a cautionary tale about some very mild, old-fashioned erotic fantasies.	It's grandly surreal stuff, counterweighted with Kubrick's unerring sense of chiaroscuro.	Kubrick's intense study of the human psyche yields an impressive cinematic work.
What should've been a rollicking, kick-the-air horror bonanza is instead reduced to a weirdly fruitless genre romp that looks to amuse and frighten, but only achieves a baffling, slightly mean-spirited tone.	Told in three completely different acts and styles, Dead Snow is like a primer of how the last 30 years of Hollywood horror has redefined the international scary movie landscape.	We get so used to foreign filmmakers giving us original twists on genres like horror it's disappointing to be reminded that they can be banal and derivative too.	Despite some dry humor, this is no-frills horror, from the hacked limbs to the gouged eyes.	It felt formulaic from start to finish.	Though it doesn't cover new ground, Dead Snow is an entertaining mix of camp, scares, and blood and guts.
Llewyn is a beautiful loser, the everyman artist who contributes to the evolution of music and helps set the stage for a Dylan but never reaps the final reward, punched out by a world ready to swoop in on his scene and leave him behind.	It steers away from any kind of sentimentality, so any time serious discussion of success or failure - either commercially or artistically - come up, they are torpedoed like some kind of sick joke. That itself carries a special kind of poignancy.	As flawless as any film this year and rock-solid confirmation that Joel and Ethan Coen are the greatest filmmakers working in America (and perhaps anywhere else) today.	Inside Llewyn Davis is a quiet triumph of a film.	It's not their best-in fact, it hardly even feels like a Coen brothers movie at all-but its majestic musical numbers and fantastic performances elevate this well above the humdrum lesser filmmakers churn out.	Smart, funny, and profoundly melancholy, Inside Llewyn Davis finds the Coen brothers in fine form.
simultaneously hilarious and chilling	Like Chaplin before him in The Great Dictator, Lubitsch aimed a wet raspberry in Der Fuhrer's face.	A great anti-war satire; Benny's best movie; Lombard comic genius is ably displayed.	Classic Lubitsch	The famed "Lubitsch touch," whatever it really was, was never put to a more formidable test the last hour is satiric perfection.	A complex and timely satire with as much darkness as slapstick, Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not To Be delicately balances humor and ethics.
Isn't worth your time!	Mean-spirited, ugly and just not funny.	The characters are, without exception, surprisingly intelligent and always sympathetic!	It comes to the 'startling' conclusion that rich kids might do the same bad things working-class kids do, but get away with it because their money gives them privileges.	Faithfully evokes the era!	Miscasted performers and humor miss the mark.
Directors Stéphane Aubier, Vincent Patar, and Benjamin Renner keep Ernest and Celestine visually stimulating, which should entertain both children and adults alike.	Delicate animation and a charming score may be why this Belgian film earned an Oscar nomination. Its story, however, makes no sense whatsoever.	It has things to say about the world, but it does so gracefully, without hitting you over the head with them.	Delightful French animation about a mouse who goes on the run with a bear, once he has agreed not to eat her.	Ernest learns to share, Celestine learns to a paint - and the audience learns that in a Disney-dominated marketplace, kids are still free to choose their own mini mouse.	Sweet and visually charming, Ernest & Celestine offers old-fashioned delights for animation lovers of all ages.
The only message worth relaying about The Messengers is: Avoid.	the Pang brothers know how to set a mood and you can tell they can handle the camera from the way they set up the opening, so it's too bad they had to work without a script	Feels like a movie you've already seen before but don't quite recall clearly. Given its pedigree (Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert are among the producers) an audience might hope for more.	It's like a movie premonition - you've seen it all before.	The first half is very well done, making it one of the best haunted house movies since The Grudge.	The Messengers is an atmospheric but derivative rip-off of countless other horror movies.
This simple 'making-of' story becomes an 'unmaking-of' documentary	There is no better indictment of the bankruptcy of artistry in big-budget cinema than the failure of Terry Gilliam.	This is a lively film, as optimistic in tone as Don Quixote is in character. And Terry Gilliam is a bright, expansive and enthusiastic filmmaker, a likeable, charismatic guy who jokes about having a budget of US$31.5 million being "half the money we need"	TV's reality shows have nothing on Lost in La Mancha. This is a reality every film buff ought to see.	Too bad for Gilliam and everyone involved, but in the departments of spectacle and schadenfreude, great fun for us.	A remarkable behind-the-scenes look at a movie that wasn't, Lost in La Mancha is an incisive, entertaining document of the difficulties inherent in the moviemaking process.
Lucky for us, the verbiage sparkles with wit and preposterousness just close enough to reality to make us grind our teeth in the agony of recognition. D'oh, I mean to make us laugh.	The result is two-tiered humor, broad enough to appeal to anybody but overlaid with jokes that will be funnier if you know the show.	When Homer tells his wife and kids, 'I've really come to like you guys,' we can't help but agree.	It really is a crushing disappointment to report that The Simpsons Movie is merely average by its own lofty standards.	We barely get a line from Mr. Burns, Moe, Lou and the rest of the bunch, but following Homer J. Simpson is not a bad way to spend an hour and a half of your summer.	The Simpsons Movie contains the hearty laughs, biting satire, and honest portrayal of an American family that makes the show so popular. And it boasts slicker animation and polished writing that hearkens back to the show's glory days.
[Wilson] either retools his lines into uncanny comic gems ... or pumps enough life into the typical monosyllabic action dialogue to make it enjoyable.	Directed by first-timer John Moore on the strength of his work on a Sega game ad, which may tell you everything you need to know about its visual sense and narrative nonsense.	A thrilling action picture for anyone who enjoys getting their auditory and visual senses assaulted, and their nerves absolutely wrecked.	From its prosaic title to its convenient timeliness, this valentine to U.S. military guys hamstrung by officious NATO bureaucrats could hardly seem less promising	Some good action, immature screenplay.	The plot for Behind Enemy Lines is more jingoistic than credible, and the overload of flashy visual tricks makes the action sequences resemble a video game.
If you listen to Marilyn Manson, read Fangoria magazine, and do all your clothes shopping at Hot Topic, then Underworld: Evolution is the movie for you. All others needn't bother.	It never lives up to the potential of its premise about a centuries-old war between rival clans of vampires and werewolves.	See it if you dig on action, vampires, werewolves, a little bit of story and plenty of bloody fun.	Loud, dark, and hopelessly enmeshed in loop-de-loop arcing plot mechanics that create more confusion than tension.	[Underworld: Evolution is] silly and ... not as good as the first film but at least it has plenty of action in it to keep the Friday night crowd happy.	A visual and aural assault on the senses, this vampire-werewolf sequel makes a lot of noise and features a heavy-handed, overly convoluted story.
The film affectionally spoofs animated-fantasy formulas.	It's silly and sweet, but never cloyingly so	The charm of the actors, the unabashedly romantic goofiness and the clever winks at classic Disney set pieces make the movie not only kid-friendly but a guilty pleasure for adults as well.	Enchanted? You will be.	Portraying a version of Disney's Snow White, [Adams] owns the character, down to every warble and twirl.	A smart re-imagining of fairy tale tropes that's sure to delight children and adults, Enchanted features witty dialogue, sharp animation, and a star turn by Amy Adams.
Suspense is apparently sustained by keeping the mountaineering info to a mum and making every character a moron.	Vertical Limit kept testing my horizontal limit. Everytime anybody talked I started to fall asleep.	Easy enough to watch.	Vertical Limit is about as silly as movies come, but the only thing that really counts is whether or not the action sequences are exciting. And they are, in a big way.	Vertical Limit is one of those edge-of-your-seat thrillers that invites lampooning. It's corny, contrived and excessive. It's also one hell of an exhilarating ride.	The plot in Vertical Limit is ludicrously contrived and cliched. Meanwhile, the action sequences are so over-the-top and piled one on top of another, they lessen the impact on the viewer.
Impressively directed, hugely enjoyable black comedy from the Coen Brothers, with a superb script and a terrific central performance from Michael Stuhlbarg.	A wonderful parable of 1960s Jewish life in Minnesota filled equally with humor and pathos.	Not vintage Coen brothers... but they're still filmmakers to love, even if they sometimes make it increasingly difficult to do so.	A Serious Man feels - initially, at least - like a return to an earlier kind of filmmaking for the Coens.	It's unclassifiable -- and also one of the best movies of the year.	Blending dark humor with profoundly personal themes, the Coen brothers deliver what might be their most mature -- if not their best -- film to date.
The motion picture as mood ring.	Ashes of Time Redux is primarily a sensory experience that deserves to be seen on as big a screen as possible.	... magnificent on a purely sensual level ... The new version is shorter by about ten minutes and is divided by chapter headings, which make the film slightly less confusing.	Christopher Doyle's mesmeric compositions remain unaltered, his experiments with colour, light and texture giving the imagery an artistry that majestically survive the moments of clumsy viscerality attempted during the fight sequences.	I know Kar Wai's got a fanbase, but to me he's equivalent to a recent film school graduate using all of the post-production tricks that he's learned, either to show off what he's learned or to cover up his lack of talent.	Wong Kar Wai's redux, with a few slight changes from his 1994 classic, is a feast for the eyes, if a little difficult to follow.
While teens are at the age of self discovery, Igby is doing his best work at self-destruction.	You'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly, watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea, shed an errant tear.	It's Harold and Maude without the humanism, Rushmore without the insight and The Graduate without the irony.	...the film generates a decent flair for angst-ridden tendencies and the misguided rebellion this youthful protagonist agonizes over with complete ambivalence.	A kinetic drama that seems to wander aimlessly, beautifully until it crashes in an odd anti-climax befitting reality itself.	In the vein of The Catcher in the Rye, Igby Goes Down is scathingly witty and sharply observant.
It's certainly worth seeing if you missed the original. If you saw it, however, there's no way of unseeing it, and nothing in the new one to top it.	The ultimate poseur movie... [A cinematic] temporary tattoo, a way of feeling underground without ever committing to anything real.	Fincher's chilly, precision filmmaking knows how to tease, while still looking head-on into the abyss.	The bottom line is that if you were too lazy to read the subtitles in the original, you won't miss Blomqvist's lack of Swedish intellect this time.	I can tell you that as a virgin to the story, this version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo completely drew me into Larsson's beautifully constructed, terrifying world.	Brutal yet captivating, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the result of David Fincher working at his lurid best with total role commitment from star Rooney Mara.
Great stuff.	Less spectacular but more cogent than later 'virtual reality' fantasies such as Total Recall and The Truman Show.	Cool retro fun.	Versăo "primitiva" de Jurassic Park, parte de uma premissa interessante, mas jamais cria tensăo suficiente no terceiro ato - apesar da boa presença de Brynner.	Robot western....cool.	Yul Brynner gives a memorable performance as a robotic cowboy in this amusing sci-fi/western hybrid.
A workmanlike production, perfectly good, not outstanding in any way (except for the last few scenes), but withal worth seeing.	Has some problems, but overall cute, clever, well-paced, well acted and well directed.	Annette Bening is as complete a reason for going to a movie as Jane Fonda was, or Marlon Brando.	A well-produced look at the London stage in pre-war London, based on a novella by Somerset Maugham. The characters may not be as endearing as intended.	The filmmakers have brought such breadth and depth to the material.	Annette Bening delivers a captivating performance in Being Julia, a sophisticated comedy that follows a 1930s stage diva who experiences an identity crisis at age 40.
Limpidly shot, translucently acted, Still Walking steals up on you quietly and stays with you forever.	Still Walking is a triumph of mood and storytelling imbued with fine performances. Kore-eda creates more bombast in the quiet of a living room than I've seen from all this year's summer blockbusters.	Koreeda makes it worth our while to watch these people, allowing us to dig for nuggets of information, piecing them together, and learning something about the resilience of family bonds along the way.	A subtly nuanced family drama that resonates long after its hushed ending.	Sensitively demonstrates how nothing much happening to this idiosyncratic family is the universal story of every family.	Hirokazu Kore-eda's film may seem modest at first, but this family drama casts a delicate, entrancing spell.
A mind-boggling, heart-rending, stomach-churning expose on the food industry.	If you're an omnivore, Food, Inc. is your "must-see" documentary this year.	You're unlikely to look at the stuff on the shelves of your supermarket in quite the same way ever again...probably won't be seen by many consumers, but it deserves to be.	Overused narration treats the audience like the cattle being abused on screen; a continuous score rams the message home, just in case we missed the point...	It's a harsh feeling, but Food, Inc. does its job in just getting out the information that most of us probably want to ignore and shouldn't.	An eye-opening expose of the modern food industry, Food, Inc. is both fascinating and terrifying, and essential viewing for any health-conscious citizen.
It's a performance film that crystallises Bausch's style in a series of dance pieces amplified by interviews about her personality, methods and inspirations.	There's no doubting the skill with which Wenders has brought them to the screen, and his use of 3D is ravishing. Interviews with the dancers are well shot, too, and beautifully integrated into an outstanding film about the art of the dance.	Pina belongs in the rare category of adventurous material matched with a thrillingly immersive form -- suck it, Avatar.	It's an enchanting film, one that makes you feel you are missing something dear if you don't dance or appreciate it as an art form.	Pina is as rich in imagery and emotion as any film released this year and in some cases moreso.	Pina is an immersive, gorgeously shot tribute to the people who express life through movement.
Individual scenes and sequences are too strange, haunting and emotionally right for the film to be dismissed. There should be no attempt or temptation to dismiss it.	With references to Citizen Kane, Treasure of Sierra Madre, and Giant, this uniquely American saga about unbridled greed and evils of capitalism is Anderson's most haunting and ambitious work to date.	There Will Be Blood reminds us that the greatest screen performances don't settle for capturing one trait, a dominant emotion or an easy way in.	Anderson's drama is a beautiful combination of incredible cinematography, plays on morals and a stern statement about oil and the search for the American dream...	There Will Be Blood will be incredibly rewarding for many movie-goers, giving them ample fodder to discuss and deconstruct for years to come.	Widely touted as a masterpiece, this sparse and sprawling epic about the underhanded "heroes" of capitalism boasts incredible performances by leads Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano, and is director Paul Thomas Anderson's best work to date.
Is it immoral to celebrate villainy? There's not much point in pretending The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't do that, pretty exuberantly too.	There is no psychological insight, no moral insight, just no insight, full stop. And it palls after a while.	God help you, you'll have to decide whether you approve without the filmmaker's help.	... overlong, repetitive, and like 'The Departed' too often partakes of self-parody ... It's almost as if Scorsese, in his rush to sate every sophomoric urge, ceded the reins to shock-jock Howard Stern.	A winning return for Martin Scorsese, who delivers his finest and most balls-out entertainment in more than a decade.	Funny, self-referential, and irreverent to a fault, The Wolf of Wall Street finds Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at their most infectiously dynamic.
As a human document 'Party Monster' is pretty much a disaster...shapeless and sloppy.	The wanton fabulistas of Party Monster are as boring and insignificant as the very 'normals and drearies' they so contemptuously deride.	Green's St. James steals the picture out from under [Culkin] (poetic justice of a sort), and the supporting cast is nothing short of amazing.	Like Alig, Party Monster is a colorful mess, all style and substances and little else.	Another of those films that leaves you with the perennial question: 'Who paid for this garbage?'	The lurid display of camp soon turns tedious.
In spite of its cheesy plot twists, thoroughly second-rate direction, and criminally wasted ensemble, Runaway Jury adds up to a nice little gotcha! courtroom melodrama.	Runaway Jury... may not be art, but you won't be bored.	...the first adaptation of a John Grisham novel whose premise and doings I found didn't ring true for a second. Yet I enjoyed the film from beginning to end. Go figure.	A guilty pleasure for some, a waste of time for most.	[T]his film ranks just below The Firm and The Client on the list of John Grisham-inspired thrillers, thumbs up.	An implausible but entertaining legal thriller.
Lovely to look at and mildly funny but tries with sweaty desperation to be the next Pirates of the Caribbean.	Só começa a funcionar minimamente quando foge de seu óbvio subtexto (político) e se concentra na imbecilidade de seus ridículos personagens.	Prince of Persia is the sort of popcorn-eating, mindless actioner you'd expect for the summer, made only slightly more appealing by Jake Gyllenhaal's performance.	It wanders through the desert, looking for an exciting hook but never finding one.	Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a great leap forward (over a corpse-ridden bed of spikes) for video game film adaptations. More importantly, it's a decent film in and of itself.	It doesn't offer much in the way of substance, but Prince of Persia is a suitably entertaining swashbuckler -- and a substantial improvement over most video game adaptations.
This one-of-a-kind fantasy film may be seen as a classic someday, possibly quite soon.	Shows plenty of visual imagination but is totally devoid of charm, wit or emotional resonance.	Aggressive visual invention is rarely its own reward, and this movie does nothing to better the odds.	Has something to astonish everyone.	The film galumphs along in static panels, prioritizing flash over thought, hyperextending a story that would barely sustain a children's picture book.	While visually dazzling, there isn't enough story to hang all the fancy effects on.
A Prodigal Panther pays the price to make peace with a turbulent past.	Despite some on-the-nose dialogue and a needless revelatory flourish toward the end, Hamilton gets at the strangeness of lived American history, in which violent ruptures leave behind poorly understood scars.	A bittersweet and well-acted drama set in 1976 about two African-Americans in Philadelphia forced to come to terms with the ghosts of their past.	This is just another reminder there is a whole pool of acting talent in America, almost a whole film industry, that white audiences are largely unaware of.	Tending towards lyricism rather than urgency, the director strikes a tone that is both melancholic and ultimately hopeful	A bold, original debut, Night Catches Us personalizes a tumultuous period in American history thanks to strong performances from Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington.
Even kids are likely to respond to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III with less enthusiasm than they did to the first two films in this series.	These fighting-intensive movies, a glorification of hurtful action, are strictly for children. While the corpse count is low, the mimicking turtles stand for nothing more important than the employment of physical force.	The oversized terrapins are characteristically flip as they backflip through an unnecessarily muddled plot.	The first film was bad, the second worse, and the third almost unbearable.	Really stupid.	It's a case of one sequel too many for the heroes in a half shell, with a tired time-travel plot gimmick failing to save the franchise from rapidly diminishing returns.
Overly convoluted.	Let's hope this really is the last in the series, because the screams are starting to die down.	Scream 3 has arrived, and to say it was well worth the wait would be an understatement.	Scream 3 is a crafty and well-crafted wrap-up that really does bring a satisfying sense of closure to the franchise.	Wes Craven should have quit when he was ahead.	According to critics, Scream 3 has become what it originally spoofed. Despite some surprising twists, the movie seems to have lost its freshness and originality by falling back on the old horror formulas and cliches.
...even less intelligent than your average action flick.	The Edge, more of a drama than the action/thriller it's being billed as, exhibits a restrained literateness that's quite effective.	...The Edge's fusion of Mametspeak with a true life adventure remains brawny entertainment, even it it is difficult to take as seriously as the filmmakers intend.	...the project resonates because of the talent of its stars...	Unsuccessfully mixes melodrama with action/adventure and satire.	The Edge is an entertaining hybrid of brainy Mamet dialogue with brawny outdoors action -- albeit one that sadly lacks as much bite as its furry antagonist.
There's the uncanny sensation that Theron has forgotten the camera and the script and is directly channeling her ideas about Aileen Wuornos. She has made herself the instrument of this character.	More often than not, Theron gives us a caricature rather than a character. As a result, Monster is a well-made movie without much purpose.	Wuornos was a far more complex creature than most accounts of her will allow, and Patty Jenkins' tough and tender movie has caught the contradictions of a woman stranded between unwarranted hope and unavoidable despair.	With the exception of Charlize Theron's masterful performance as Wuornos, the film is a misguided mess.	Not only is [Charlize] Theron completely convincing as Florida serial killer Aileen Wuornos, she's virtually unrecognizable.	Charlize Theron gives a searing, deglamorized performance as real life serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster, an intense, disquieting portrait of a profoundly damaged soul.
Manages to turn a highly dubious concept into a subtle and deliciously mordant comedy.	This in-reference fest for frightfilm fans has enough chuckles and shudders even for those who've never heard of Nosferatu.	...an incredibly uneven flick.	Wickedly fun.	One of the year's most watchable movies, particularly for film buffs.	Shadow of the Vampire is frightening, compelling, and funny, and features an excellent performance by Willem Dafoe.
Although the movie has an extremely retrograde viewpoint, it is a must-see for those trying to understand the hype around charter schools.	Guggenheim's thesis that bad schools create bad neighbourhoods and not vice versa is interesting, if perhaps simplistic.	In the end, this is scattergun film-making, well-intentioned but sloppy, sometimes deliberately evasive. If this documentary were an exam essay, I'd fail it.	... a close look at the current (US education) system is all it takes to consider making a real change.	By focusing on these five kids and their hopeful families, Waiting for Superman puts a human face on a crisis worthy of a superhero.	Gripping, heartbreaking, and ultimately hopeful, Waiting for Superman is an impassioned indictment of the American school system from An Inconvenient Truth director Davis Guggenheim.
There's a great deal of general creepiness, but the enterprise is undercut by a weak script, weak characters, and a too simple plot.	Scary bad and a frightening waste of talent.	Rather than spending valuable screen time trying to convince us that three pretentious film school students and a bunch of trees are actually scary, House on Haunted Hill actually shows us scary stuff.	Slow-moving, yawn-inducing.	The mix of laughs, shocks and gruesomeness is much the same as in the two Tales from the Crypt movies, but Malone coaxes a slightly fresher flavour, taking on board the influence of David Fincher and even Lars von Trier.	Unsophisticated and unoriginal film fails to produce scares.
No actor wants to be most remembered for work they did 20 years ago, but Ringwald was truly on another level here.	Sweet but predictible angst-ridden Brat Pack outing.	It belts along pleasingly enough, but this frenetic, hard-edged comedy drama is too hackneyed to be entirely successful.	Its deceptively soft title is a mask for a fairly powerful and pointed commentary on social standards, class differences and facades.	Miss Ringwald's pouty naturalness remains her biggest asset, and her performance is once again appealing.	Molly Ringwald gives an outstanding performance in this sweet, intelligent teen comedy that takes an ancient premise and injects it with insight and wit.
Just because a film is geared toward first-graders doesn't mean it has to sound like it was written by one.	A predictable but pleasant kids movie.	A breezy caper that will entertain children without testing their parents' patience.	Bland but likable kids' movie.	A horse of a different color!	An entertaining children movie that ought to be tolerable for adults.
I enjoyed Eclipse about as much as someone outside the target audience can, but that still isn't enough to merit an outright recommendation.	The latest installment of the Twilight franchise's teeny-bopper-vampire-werewolf-melodrama comes the closest so far to presenting an entertaining cinematic experience but still not close enough for uninitiated audiences.	In director David Slade's hands, the story plays like two movies in one, neither being particularly well made, whether it's the would-be action horror of a brewing vampire-on-werewolf fight or the endlessly talky Bella-Edward torpor.	There's a narrative of sorts, but it stands squarely behind the flat conversing and posturing of the washboard abs-blessed Jacob, moody Edward and humorless Bella.	No sex before marriage makes vampirism totally unsexy in this riskless, casualty-free confrontation	Stuffed with characters and overly reliant on uninspired dialogue, Eclipse won't win The Twilight Saga many new converts, despite an improved blend of romance and action fantasy.
Provides a good feel for the fun and exciting parts of Mobile's Mardi Gras as well as the undercurrent of "traditional" racial segregation that still exists today.	Wise and soberly affecting documentary about the separate but unequal Mardi Gras festivities that take place each year in Mobile, Ala.	Mobile and its still-segregated Mardi Gras tradition seem to be world unto themselves, presented without reference to the wider world's pressing issues--the failing economy, environmental concerns, war in Iraq. The documentary's impressive compilation of	An invaluable portrait of us-and-them America, a smart, generous, poignant, quietly disturbing movie about secrecy and hospitality.	Finds an unusual tonal sweet spot somewhere in between absurdist comedy and melancholy in considering two groups at a socio-historical impasse.	More than a documentary about the oldest Mardi Gras celebration in the south, Order of Myths encompasses the eccentric characters of Mobile and the still-lingering racial tensions that surround them.
Genre fans will definitely get off on I Sell the Dead, but outsiders might be less enthusiastic.	The sort of movie that was probably more fun to make than it is to watch.	I Sell the Dead sports playful genre inventiveness, in which fans can delight and even outsiders can enjoy.	A fine pair of grave robbers, (director) Mr. McQuaid and (producer) Mr. Fessenden plunder freely from the movie crypt, unearthing other chomping, glowing mysteries and monstrosities.	Uneven Victorian-era supernatural horror-comedy about grave-robbing.	A horror comedy that's almost as chilling as it is funny, I Sell the Dead relies on its dark humor and offbeat charm to overcome its low budget shortcomings.
Will Adam Green make a great, iconic movie eventually? In time, perhaps. I don't think we do him any favors to claim he already has...but I will say that FROZEN is a step in the right direction.	The brain is far more afraid of the possible than the impossible, and Green knows this	However much fun it is to watch, it's a lot more fun to pull it apart afterwards.	What makes Frozen really work is the way that the characters react to their predicament.	Adam Green's taut, toe-curling survival thriller is better than it should be: the concept and the characters' behaviour are mostly plausible, the script is dark and funny, the acting is adequate, and the wildlife scenes are convincing.	Writer/director Adam Green has the beginnings of an inventive, frightening yarn in Frozen, but neither the script nor the cast are quite strong enough to truly do it justice.
Spielberg should have sued for 'breach of earth-shattering stupidity'.	Pacing leaves a lot to be desired and the moment-of-attack sequences, full of jagged cuts and a great deal of noise, more closely resemble the view from inside a washing machine.	Spielberg should never have sold the sequel rights	Significantly worse than the rest of the series, this film is one of the worst bell-flops in recent cinema.	Jaws the Revenge, the fourth in a series of monster shark epics, is dead in the water.	Illogical, tension-free, and filled with cut-rate special effects, Jaws 4 - The Revenge is a sorry chapter in a once-proud franchise.
A grown-up comedy with enough good writing, chemistry, and alien-rich special effects to lift Duchovny's career out of the doldrums.	Paying homage to his previous and better work, Reitman's new comedy is marked by one-idea story, sporadic humor that lacks wit, and cheesy special effects.	Saddled with a listless, haphazard script ... that's little more than a concept and doesn't bother to hang together.	A fitfully funny sci-fi comedy.	Once again, the overblown and ultimately uninvolving special effects overshadow some actors working pretty damn hard.	Director Reitman tries to remake Ghostbusters, but his efforts are largely unsuccessful because the movie has too many comedic misfires.
It's refreshing to see a kids' action movie in which the most crucial 'special effect' is a rubber band.	More so than the first movie, Spy Kids 2 is sheer fun. Having already revealed his characters, writer-director Robert Rodriguez can concentrate on their adventures.	It's going to be a real hoot watching this duo growing up.	Rock solid family fun out of the gates, extremely imaginative through out, but wanes in the middle	Spy Kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels: It actually improves upon the original hit movie.	Though the concept is no longer fresh, Spy Kids 2 is still an agreeable and energetic romp.
It's a decent diversion.	The original and the remake need to stand alone and apart, and Zombie's film has merits of its own that should be appreciated.	The often-awkward original is worth about a tenth of its considerable reputation, yet when compared to Zombie's version it actually looks good.	Adeptly packaged in all facets of production, Halloween is nicely cast with a combination of Zombie regulars, familiar faces and compelling newcomers and satisfyingly constructed with camerawork that heightens the suspense on the page.	The life and times of a fictional monster may not be as respectable a subject as a historical monster like, say, Idi Amin or Truman Capote, but Zombie's portrait is every bit as reverent, scrupulous, and deeply felt as any Oscar-grubbing horrorshow.	Rob Zombie doesn't bring many new ideas to the table in Halloween, making it another bloody disappointment for fans of the franchise.
Even those who believe they couldn't think less of the disgraced Tour de France-winning cyclist will regard "The Armstrong Lie" as the final nail in the coffin he built himself.	If you followed the scandal closely over the years, it'll likely feel like going over old ground....for all its flaws, the film offers as compelling and fair a summary of the case and the man for those less well-versed in the tale...	The Armstrong Lie is eye-opening and myth-shattering and more than a little depressing.	To use a phrase from the film, The Armstrong Lie is a "myth-buster." It's wholly necessary, brilliantly executed, and a complete bummer.	Power must never be mistaken for virtue, warns Gibney, and self-regulation doesn't work. Even the best of us need to be kept an eye on.	Smartly constructed and scathingly sharp, The Armstrong Lie presents an effective indictment of its unscrupulous subject -- as well as the sports culture that spawned him.
This little caper yarn's as breezy as a Buffett song (he peppers the soundtrack) and as simple.	Hoot tells kids they can make a difference in this world, and that's worth a hundred Ice Age 2's.	Younger kids will find the pranks and schemes funny, while the enviro-activist theme is an important message to which they may just latch on. The eco-responsibility part, not the venomous snake part, one hopes.	It's wholesome, righteous, but not exceptionally entertaining, even with the soundtrack packed with new Jimmy Buffett tunes.	The movie is unessential at best. But the Everglades -- and the owls that live nearby -- are irresistible.	Lacking energy and humor, Hoot is a ho-hum story of eco-awareness that falls flat as a pancake.
A highly watchable documentary that follows the comedian's attempt to develop new stage material.	Seinfeld fans will come out with a better understanding of why Seinfeld does what he does -- but they'll receive no hint of how he does it.	Despite apparent motives to the contrary, it ends up being, like [Seinfeld's] revered TV show, about pretty much nothing.	Sometimes, comedians can be just as amusing backstage as they are when facing an audience.	aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd, there's little to be learned from watching 'Comedian'	Comedian is an insightful look at the hard work of creating comedy.
A frothy, funny, frivolous affair, largely because of Grant's contributions.	Assembly line romantic comedies often rise or fall based on the stars at their center, and Music and Lyrics is lucky to have both Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant (as opposed to, say, Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey) offering their services.	Music and Lyrics has a very strange notion of how business meetings are conducted and an even stranger opinion of the pull songwriters have in the music industry, but Barrymore's balancing act keeps everything else feeling real.	...when this movie gets a moment right, it nails it. It's now you tolerate/notice the rest that will affect your experience.	No matter how maudlin or lightweight a script can be, Hugh Grant always manages to charm the mediocrity out of it through his amusing and charismatic presence.	Music & Lyrics is a light and pleasant romantic comedy that succeeds because of the considerable charm of its co-stars. The music segments featuring Hugh Grant are worth the price of admission.
The unforced intimacy between James Cromwell and Genevieve Bujold as a senior couple in the fact-based Still Mine is rare to see in characters of any age. For actors playing a husband in his late eighties and his wife of over sixty years, it's remarkable.	Slow and meticulously crafted, Still Mine wins points for finding the right pace to play out this story of old traditions versus new rules, youth versus decrepitude, and loving denial versus responsible acceptance.	The mounting structure-and the subsequent stop-work orders-frames the couple's reflections about the approaching uncertainties of their twilight years, which they deliver with humor and affection.	Cromwell and Bujold have an easy, convincing rapport, creating a detailed emotional history for this couple that makes them seem devoted, and not mere twinkly geriatric clichés.	An Occupy Wall Street supporter is part of the most conservative indie film you'll see all year. Still Mine is a heartbreaking classic no matter your ideology, though.	James Cromwell and Genevičve Bujold are outstanding in this tender, affecting, insightful drama about the bonds and sacrifices of marriage.
If you feel like something more exotic than your average Hollywood fare, a fine cast, fantastic set designs, and the score by Vladimir Cosma make Diva an enjoyable film to watch.	Half a century later, a glut of über-groovy meta-thrillers has blunted the novelty of Diva, but its gamboling flair is still a kick.	... Beineix directs with a visual cleverness and a witty playfulness that tells the audience to hang back and have fun.	This is style as a force of nature.	One of the most exciting feature debuts, Beineix's film is a rare work, generic yet personal, arty and commercial, an exquisitely shot and edited picture that reminds us why we fell in love with movies in the first place.	Beineix combines unique cinematography, an intelligent script, and a brilliant soundtrack to make Diva a stylishly memorable film.
There's absolutely zippo to fear about this movie, unless you're the kind of person who jumps when formula bogeymen do exactly what you'd expect them to do.	Thankfully, Prom Night's predictable ending doesn't suggest a remake of the original's 1987 sequel, Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night 2. No kidding, that's what it was called.	Corny, monotonous and very far from scary	A stalk-and-slash horror movie with precious few slashes, the PG-13-rated Prom Night is a tame, by-the-numbers affair without surprises or a point of any kind.	PROM NIGHT is a must avoid and is the real reason why studios don't screen certain movies for critics.	A dim and predictable remake of an already dull slasher film, this Prom Night fails to be memorable.
Strong on premise, the film is short on plot.	Unevenly acted, hatched from a one joke premise and trading precariously on a single performance, Liar Liar shouldn't be as funny as it is.	Finds an amusing premise and beats the hell out of it, propelling it into one hysterically funny situation after another.	Oh, I wasn't expecting much, really. And it was much better than Dumb and Dumber.	It's a magnificent comic experience.	Despite its thin plot, Liar Liar is elevated by Jim Carrey's exuberant brand of physical humor, and the result is a laugh riot that helped to broaden the comedian's appeal.
Dalton, with his athletic sort of Brit-yuppie work ethic and romantic streak, comes out all right.	Timothy Dalton, the fourth Bond, registers beautifully on all key counts of charm, machismo, sensitivity and technique.	A pure back-to-basics action-adventure spy drama which mostly delivers.	The casting of Timothy Dalton as James Bond in this 15th entry into the adventures of 007 is widely considered a classic mistake: Dalton isn't suave like Sean Connery or even Roger Moore.	This Bond is as fast on his feet as with his wits; an ironic scowl creases his face; he's battle ready yet war-weary.	In The Living Daylights, newcomer Timothy Dalton plays James Bond with more debonair seriousness than preceding installments, and the result, is energetic, exciting, and occasionally weighty.
89 minutes of Shue's strained Acting display is 89 more than anyone should ever have to endure.	It is moving and has been well-crafted with much care, and it allows Shue, Eckhart, Jane and Jill Hennessy as Molly's doctor to make solid impressions.	Beautiful as she is, Elisabeth Shue is simply impossible to watch without cringing whenever she tries to do autistic.	Bizarrely inept.	Nothing feels authentic--not the relationships or the earnest performances from the soap opera-pretty cast.	Molly never really elevates above uninspired, cliche-ridden moments.
By blanketing the prison experience with a sepia-tone haze of nostalgia and placing it in a time that's part history, part Normal Rockwell, the film provides a trip through the belly of the beast that isn't too icky...	One of the greatest films ever committed to celluloid.	With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages.	The Shawshank Redemption continually abandons plausibility in order to celebrate the triumph of hope over despair, of decency over cruelty, of justice over injustice.	It's a devoutly old-fashioned, spiritually uplifting prison drama about two lifers who must break their emotional shackles before they can finally become free men.	The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.
A skillfully constructed morality play that pushes all the right buttons and arrives at all the right conclusions.	What craven offal!	Despite certain drawbacks, A Time to Kill is involving, energetic, and occasionally thought-provoking. All things considered, this film will make for a worthwhile trip to the cinema for all, not just those who have time to kill.	The best Grisham to hit the screen yet.	Insight into black/white relations is superficial -- disappointing when you consider that the moral of the story is supposed to be how large a role race plays in the execution of justice.	Overlong and superficial, A Time to Kill nonetheless succeeds on the strength of its skillful craftsmanship and top-notch performances.
An unnecessarily morbid premise that sits uneasily with the slapstick comedy that follows.	The Pacifier provides passable, albeit predictable, family fare sure to please the kids without forcing their adult counterparts to whine like babies.	[An] unintentional fascist satire.	a nice, safe family film	The Pacifier represents a form of cruel, but actually very usual, punishment for anyone past the age of 7.	Vin Diesel parodies his tough guy image for the family audience, but the result is only moderately amusing.
Not quite the whip smart dissection of the genre that it wants to be, but there are plenty of decent laughs.	Kunis and Timberlake are winningly comfortable with one another, even if the movie isn't always comfortable with itself.	Mila Kunis is so adorable and energetic she even manages to make Justin Timberlake likeable, and that is saying a lot.	It's got witty moments and (for an American picture) some relaxed, funny, nearly realistic sex scenes but it's too slickly self-aware and intently selling itself at times.	All of these quirky details felt like independent pieces crammed together for the sake of edginess.	Friends with Benefits adds nothing new to its well-worn rom-com formula, but the chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis is almost enough to carry the movie by itself.
Movies like this classically low-key, slightly off-kilter effort by Jim Jarmusch are the reason the term "art house film" was coined in the first place.	Don's journey peels back the surface of so many American dreams to find them wanting, while Winston, dodging kids and doting on his 'perfect' wife, seems as rich as a king.	...an imperfect but sometimes beautiful comic story about a man helplessly lost in his own life.	Murray's performance in [the film's] last sequence is quite possibly the best bit of acting he has ever done.	There's a real poignancy in watching Murray's emotional chill thaw from the heat generated by even the idea of romance, or at least its more libidinous evil twin, lust.	Bill Murray's subtle and understated style complements director Jim Jarmusch's minimalist storytelling in this quirky, but deadpan comedy.
Considering the weakness of the material that she has been given to work with, Ricci does what she can but the only person likely to cherish this particular performance is Mr. Skin.	makes you think too much about what it's doing, rather than what it's about, thus drawing you away from the deeper philosophical questions of life and death at its core	Maddeningly inert [and] caught in a pretentious no-man's land between horror and melodrama.	Best of all is Neeson, who is nicely creepy. Whether he's genuinely gifted or knuckle-chewing insane, he's not the kind of guy you'd want to spend time with, either way.	Boiled down to what's actually presented, the whole movie is misdirection, executed without any subtlety.	It has an interesting premise and admirable ambitions, but After.Life fails to deliver enough twists or thrills to sustain its creepy atmosphere.
Stunning documentary which should have won an Oscar.	A prodigious achievement that conveys the fabric of modern American life, aspirations and incidentally, sports, in close-up and at length, Hoop Dreams is a documentary slam dunk.	Fascinating look at the whole culture behind college basketball recruiting. Very well structured and edited.	unfolds like life itself, with unexpected ups and downs, joys and disappointments both small and large, and a sense of lived experience	This is the best type of documentary, giving an intensely personal story you can't help but become involved in, and also raises fundamental issues about America in the 90s.	One of the most critically acclaimed documentaries of all time, Hoop Dreams is a rich, complex, heartbreaking, and ultimately deeply rewarding film that uses high school hoops as a jumping-off point to explore issues of race, class, and education in modern America.
Ian McKellen, magnificent as Sherlock, brings us a riveting character study of a lion not going gentle into winter.	It's a fairly compelling tale, but the intrigue we expect of a Holmes story is conspicuously lacking, even with three different mysteries unfurling onscreen.	Director Bill Condon and screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher are clueless, and come up with an incoherent, implausible, contrived mishmash.	Fans of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories will undoubtedly relish in the way Bill Condon's film-adapted from a 2005 novel-plays with canon.	Sherlock Holmes is a kind of detective Superman, and what makes "Mr. Holmes" so intriguing - in addition to a terrific performance by Ian McKellen as the title character - is seeing him facing his own personal Kryptonite.	Mr. Holmes focuses on the man behind the mysteries, and while it may lack Baker Street thrills, it more than compensates with tenderly wrought, well-acted drama.
Everything is in its place, including the overly tidied-up meaning.	Based on the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, this haunting drama may be set in a parallel reality, but what it has to say about human hopes and societal ambition is deeply relevant. It's also beautifully directed and acted.	Romanek deploys an elegant, deceptively simple visual style here which helps keep the subtle performances front and centre. The end result is a low-key sci-fi film that's strange and sad.	Never Let Me Go settles for the worst of two genres - the dreary arthouse film and the sci-fi feature.	The movie amounts to a prolonged sigh.	With Never Let Me Go, Mark Romanek has delivered a graceful adaptation that captures the spirit of the Ishiguro novel -- which will be precisely the problem for some viewers.
Often bitterly funny.	Full of sympathy for the worker's plight.	Much like the lives it depicts, Mondays in the Sun is repetitious, uneventful and, in the end, dull.	Javier Bardem plays the part with all the pent-up animal rage of a young Robert De Niro	Mondays in the Sun is heartfelt and true and as tedious as a movie about chronic unemployment can be.	Javier Bardem gives an outstanding performance in this hought-provoking (though occasionally plodding) movie about the effects of unemployment on a group of former shipyard workers.
Given Coppola's fashion-first approach, it's a miracle the film doesn't feel more like a long perfume ad. But the movie has atmosphere, beauty, spirit, and exquisite production design, photography, and editing.	Dazed and confused, it feels like a teenager's diary, read aloud over some awesome mixtape.	With her third film, Sophia Coppola exhibits an annoying preference for style over substance.	A visually scrumptious version of France's iconic but ill-fated Austrian-born queen, Marie Antoinette.	Sofia Coppola keeps making these aptly crafted, perfectly vapid little films. She's the arthouse Tony Scott.	Lavish imagery and a daring soundtrack set this film apart from most period dramas; in fact, style complete takes precedence over plot and character development in Coppola's vision of the doomed queen.
It's an intense, blood-curdling, debatably cynical portrait of geniuses as sociopaths, or at least the ones who have to work at it.	Words fail to adequately describe just how everything down to the most minute detail converge into a climax that is at once exciting, scary, intense, joyous, heartbreaking, exhilarating, and altogether powerfully cathartic.	There's an energy that's undeniably spellbinding, but it feels too hollow.	Writer-director Damien Chazelle grabs us with his dynamic story and holds us in the palm of his hand from beginning to end.	Ultimately, what keeps Whiplash from becoming a joyride whose effects last only as long as its adrenaline rush are Simmons and Teller's performances and Chazelle's insight into Andrew's personality.	Intense, inspiring, and well-acted, Whiplash is a brilliant sophomore effort from director Damien Chazelle and a riveting vehicle for stars J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller.
... the fights are terrific, tightly choreographed with a good sense of ensemble movement and shot in long takes that preserve the fluidity of the action...	Takes its time to get going, but once the action kicks in, it's mildly engaging with lots of mindless fun, especially for avid fans of martial arts films.	At its heart, Chocolate is a simple tale of a special girl trying to make her way in a considerably unspecial world.	Chocolate (Chokgohlaet) offers sensational martial arts set pieces -- beautifully choreographed, exquisitely colored, and acrobatically shot.	It boils down to this: Thai girl fighting. Is that enough of a movie for you?	Chocolate is a bizarre martial arts flick, with a slushy plot, an unusual protagonist, and breathtaking stunts.
Apatow shows how a comedy should and can be more like life, without sacrificing a laugh.	There is raunch aplenty, but none that doesn't serve a story that is sharp, smart and wry	Knocked Up is a knockout.	Though some, including the filmmakers, might find this sort of material smart and real, others might consider it middlebrow and not particularly representative of the complex and interesting people they know, some of whom are even men.	Very funny for an hour, Judd Apatow's script and direction are finally mugged by a gang worse than any of these. The feelgood moralists, who terrorise all parts of Tinseltown.	Knocked Up is a hilarious, poignant and refreshing look at the rigors of courtship and child-rearing, with a sometimes raunchy, yet savvy script that is ably acted and directed.
Both benefits and suffers from Jolie, who delivers a quality performance while her mega-star wattage shifts the focus from the front page to the gossip page.	Blame the demands of a high-profile production on the sensibilities of someone who, success or failure, has at least never been this boring.	Honesty and courage are the main virtues of A Mighty Heart, which strives to shed light on dark times. Central to it is Jolie's laudable performance.	The signal achievement of A Mighty Heart, somewhat at odds with its affirmative title, is the sense it creates of universal complicity.	... A Mighty Heart fails to do the story justice or to flesh out the heroic people involved.	Angelina Jolie conveys the full emotional range of a woman in a desperate situation in A Mighty Heart, an urgent yet tactful film about a difficult subject.
"Sherrybaby" is an insightful and penetrating drama that never condescends or sentimentalizes its subject. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a tour de force performance that is not to be missed.	Gyllenhaal couldn't be better in service of a film that seems to focus on the wrong character; the more interesting point of view would be Bobby's, a gallant, unglamorous guy who's trying to hold his family together in the midst of Hurricane Sherry.	The writing and directing by Laurie Collyer express an admirable naturalness and eschews rose-tinted solutions.	The film itself is a collection of emotional highs and mostly lows for Gyllenhaal, who elevates it all far above the slim story.	Like Vera Farmiga in DOWN TO THE BONE, Gyllenhaal creates a full-bodied portrait of a woman struggling with addictions. And like Felicity Huffman in TRANSAMERICA, Gyllenhaal elevates a flawed motion picture to a higher level.	Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers riveting performance as a recovering drug addict in a depressing and not entirely believable movie.
A movie that blandly goes where too many Star Trek pictures have gone before.	I am a Star Trek fan, it's an even-numbered film, and sadly, it blew. I am so sad.	Without an intriguing adversary for Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and crew, it's all for naught.	definitely something different, even if it doesn't quite live up to the filmmakers' obviously grandiose ideas	Light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection. Which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors.	Nemesis has an interesting premise and some good action scenes, but the whole affair feels a bit tired.
An energetic, pleasing family movie, with plenty of clever humor and a cast of endearing animals.	The script is lackluster and unambitious. Well, lame really. Eddie Murphy is truly the only reason to see DR2.	If you thought Murphy's recent movies have been increasingly bland, this is certainly more of the same.	[O]verall it's a funny film, but parents should decide if the anti-gay and misogynist elements are worth the laughs.	Modestly entertaining.	Although there are laughs to be had in Dr. Dolittle 2, its preoccupation with toilet humor and Murphy's restrained performance makes this a missed opportunity.
Nosferatu the Vampyre Playing to the visual and narrative strengths of the original, Werner Herzog still succeeds in imprinting the material with his own unique sensibility.	...a respectful remake...it is moody, mesmeric, and entrancing.	The acting is too eccentric and the narrative drive too weak to satisfy fans of the genre, but Herzog's admirers will find much in the film's animistic landscapes and clusters of visionary imagery.	A competent, atmospheric remake, but, considering the quality of Murnau's masterwork, is it necessary?	Sumptuous yet earthy, philosophical yet humorous, it's a masterpiece in its own right.	Stunning visuals from Werner Herzog and an intense portrayal of the famed bloodsucker from Klaus Kinski make this remake of Nosferatu a horror classic in its own right.
It's a pleasure to watch Macy, with customary craft and intelligence, create from the ground up an unlikely, yet plausible romantic lead.	Not the most thrilling nor plausible story you'll ever see, but it does have an earthy charm.	The Coolermay be all about losers, but there's no doubt this quirky gem is a winner.	Makes enough smart plays for it to be worth seeing, but it falls very short of the royal flush.	The odds of things falling so much in someone's favour like they do here are ridiculously remote, but this neon fairytale is worth throwing your money away on.	A small movie elevated by superb performances.
I just don't find the guys funny, and this feature-length visit is a whole lotta headache stretched over too little material.	Huh huh huh. That was cool.	What's so funny is that we're all a little Butthead inside.	A wonderful bit of anarchy, anti-social fun; at times tasteless, but always funny.	Truly, it does not suck.	Beavis and Butt-Head Do America is unabashedly offensive, unapologetically stupid, and unexpectedly funny.
The Thirteenth Floor is as unlucky as its title regarding lively acting, believable dialogue and a compelling plot apart from the sci-fi aspects.	It's an effective noir thriller that keeps you, if not on the edge of your seat, at least curious about what might happen next.	Most of the surprises in this intriguing premise are already being used by eXistenZ and The Matrix.	Works on a more human level, although more through philosophical pondering than well-defined characters.	Though the film tried, it simply couldn't create too much depth for its characters.	Bad script and confusing plot undermine the movie's impressive visuals.
The movie's strength isn't in the impact of what it reveals; it's in putting the starting points for all this polemic in one accessible place, now presented to a wide audience	Michael Moore takes scattershot aim at the presidency of George W. Bush, hitting some targets and missing others.	Moore films exactly how we think in the age of 164-channel cable TV, flipping among a variety of moods and tones, engaging in levels of discourse both high and low.	Moore reaches the audiences' boiling point with his documentary diatribe	Scathingly funny and sometimes heartbreaking.	Extremely one-sided in its indictment of the Bush administration, but worth watching for the humor and the debates it'll stir.
Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot. But Director Ron Who-ward saw gold in a pot.	Truly crowd pleasin' and Carrey's the reason.	Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas is one overstuffed movie, but it's by no means a turkey.	Howard and his writers have made some interesting choices in bringing one of the most well-known American Christmas cartoons to life on the big screen.	[It] could have certainly benefited from a little more of that mischievous nature.	Jim Carrey shines as the Grinch. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save this movie. You'd be better off watching the TV cartoon.
'Put Kevin Costner in it and you've got a sporty Stand and Deliver. The script writes itself.'	McFarland, USA risks nothing and, therefore, ultimately achieves little.	Kevin Costner's signature knack for sports movies does little to buoy a stilted culture-clash dynamic.	Yes, "McFarland USA" has the obligatory coda where we found out how everything played out for the coach and the key members of that 1987 team. You should stick around for that.	It demonstrates that there's a reason Hollywood keeps turning out these inspirational sports movies: Because they work.	Disney's inspirational sports drama formula might be old hat, but McFarland, USA proves it still works -- especially with a talented director and eminently likable star in the mix.
Gritty, dark and unapologetically violent, Land of the Dead is a solid, serious zombie movie.	the film works best on that deliciously, subversively subliminal level, twisting its metaphor of exploited underclasses	Gory sight gags and intestine eating abound in this must-see movie for fans of the horror genre.	The scariest moments in this film have nothing to do with gut-munching and everything to do with evolution, when the zombies don't behave the way they're supposed to.	Apart from the sunshiny ending, brains are all over the place in both respects in Land of the Dead, a fine example of hard-R genre fun.	George A. Romero's latest entry in his much-vaunted Dead series is not as fresh as his genre-inventing original, Night of the Living Dead. But Land of the Dead does deliver on the gore and zombies-feasting-on-flesh action.
Sure, it's blissfully energetic, but it's also exhaustingly idiotic.	The car chases are fierce, the fight sequences are appropriately staged and shot, and Statham's allure as the title character is undeniable.	An embarrassment of giggles.	Transporter 2 softens the formula a bit, but still delivers the kind of vivid, pounding action that B-movie fans crave.	there's no denying that Statham is once again so cool that bad plot, bad physics and bad acting by the supporting cast are very easily forgotten.	A stylish and more focused sequel to The Transporter, the movie is over-the-top fun for fans of the first movie.
An enjoyable if rather pallid rendering of Carroll's classic tale.	plays as a series of colorful, but uneven setpieces that lack an interesting or emotionally engaging heroine to tie them together	a whirlwind ride... Disney's trippiest film	Even as straightforward eye candy, the film is a near miss	Lovely animation and trippy story ruined by never-ending, excruciating songs.	A good introduction to Lewis Carroll's classic, Alice in Wonderland boasts some of the Disney canon's most surreal and twisted images.
A brave adaptation of a bracing book.	If you can get past the subject matter, you'll find yourself challenged and yes, even entertained.	This is one of these films that you either love or hate. I loved it.	The satire gradually becomes overdone and heavy-handed.	Rounded out with crisp, antiseptic photography and a soundtrack mixing the brilliant and the deliberately banal, this is a powerhouse journey into the dark side.	If it falls short of the deadly satire of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, American Psycho still finds its own blend of horror and humor, thanks in part to a fittingly creepy performance by Christian Bale.
The film is so predictable, the steps plod one after each other to the inevitable conclusion.	While the picture's mood is inspired by the independent spirit of 1970s crime dramas, it's been given a send-'em-home-smiling, corporate Hollywood scrubbing clean.	Road to Perdition grabbed my attention simply by being a solid story told with style and intelligence.	There's no spontaneity in David Self's spare, purely functional screenplay, which telegraphs even the biggest surprises so as to dull any edge inherent in the brutal payoffs.	For all its hard-boiled pretensions, Road to Perdition becomes a cloying look at father-son relations in gangster-era Chicagoland.	Somber, stately, and beautifully mounted, Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition is a well-crafted mob movie that explores the ties between fathers and sons.
I was impressed with how Jones's uncomfortable mixing of tones in the first half of the film gave way to something more elegiac and evocative by the end.	Epic, intimate, allegorical and ornery.	"The Homesman" may sound like a title conferred on a man, and George Briggs may be driving the wagon. But it is Mary Bee's persistence and prayers that carry the women, and the film, flawed as it sometimes is, home.	While the film is bathed in a beautiful magic-hour glow courtesy of cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Jones' journey doesn't quite take off.	The film looks great and its heart is in the right place, but it ultimately falls into a rut of cynicism and brutality that feels unearned and unnecessary.	A squarely traditional yet somewhat progressive Western, The Homesman adds another absorbing entry to Tommy Lee Jones' directorial résumé.
Despite the talent on show, there's little to distinguish this from any other bland family comedy.	The essential cartooniness of the plot and the gags works against the rather lame attempt to lather on a message about reconciliation between father and son.	Cuteness can't carry an entire movie, and Underdog is short of actual funny stuff and affecting performances, to the extent that this Disney movie comes off like a Disney made-for-TV movie.	I have an idea for the sequel: Underdog Vs. Michael Vick.	I had a painless enough time. And so -- given a quiet Saturday, a stifling heat wave and a fretful kindergartener to contend with -- might you.	Underdog is a mostly forgettable adaptation that relies far too heavily on recycled material and sloppy production.
Taken as a sequel to Halloween, this is just above average; taken as a sequel to Halloween Two, which is where most of its backstory comes from, it looks terrific.	The selfish pea brains who brought their bright-eyed infant to...this violent horror movie deserve a private, late-night visit from the uncompromising Michael Myers.	Halloween H2O is merely just another cliched entry into the overstuffed trunk of slasher films.	...the film is as predictable as all the other slasher flicks that followed Halloween.	Though too conventional to be truly thrilling, Halloween H20 is a fitting final round for one of screen history's bloodiest family feuds.	Halloween: H2O is the best of the many sequels, yet still pales in comparison to the original Halloween.
It's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer Travolta was, and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career.	An unembarrassed movie musical, something my generation experienced only in Sunday-afternoon movies on TV.	Grease is a great 'fun movie'.	Randal Kleiser's 1978 musical, set in the Fifties, has some horrible acting but the kind of exuberance that has made it a cult classic.	Too pure to be pink.	Grease is a pleasing, energetic musical with infectiously catchy songs and an ode to young love that never gets old.
The underwritten script fails to develop its premise adequately, shifts gears mechanically and comes too easily to a convenient finale.	A triumph of personality over performance and content.	A sweet, sentimental and broadly entertaining salute to fathers and sons.	Typical Adam Sandler -- charm mixed with crude humor.	Big Daddy is surprisingly sentimental and consistently amusing.	Adam Sandler acquits himself admirably, but his charm isn't enough to make up for Big Daddy's jarring shifts between crude humor and mawkish sentimentality.
This film really succeeds with its warm treatment of ordinary hang-ups -- no life-shattering revelations or pain repressed since childhood, just the genuine, everyday trials of life.	Natalie Portman, as a 13-year-old on whom Hutton develops a strangely affecting crush, is a delight.	Women may be unimpressed, but men will squirm with recognition.	Rosie O'Donnell's best 10 minutes of her career.	Wise and clever, a refreshingly different take on gender relations.	A warm, thoughtful dramedy about male insecurity, Beautiful Girls is buoyed by an excellent cast - particularly Natalie Portman in a stunning early role.
As inspirational football movies go, this well-intentioned but disappointing effort sputters and stalls, like putting coal in a tattered Christmas stocking.	For a movie about the effects of tragedy on the people in a football town, We Are Marshall doesn't care about the grief process, its characters, or, most shockingly, football.	What should have been an inspirational story about fortitude and courage in the face of mind-numbing tragedy becomes a compendium of sports cliches.	Too long and too talky. It takes 40 minutes for star Matthew McConaughey to make his first appearance.	There's genuine emotion in this movie, and wide-ranging ones at that. There's the shock of loss, the struggle in moving forward, the fear of failure and the joy of putting one's passion into a good cause, regardless of the results.	Matthew McConaughey almost runs We Are Marshall to the end zone, but can't stop it from taking the easy, feel-good route in memorializing this historic event in American sports.
Brutal. Graphic. Disturbing. The remake of "Last House on the Left" is all those things. And, oh yes, this adults-only story is ancient.	If you must, seek out the original to see nasty things happen to nasty people in a nasty film.	In this era of torture porn, this film seems intent on reconnecting audiences with the power and intensity of real-life, even quiet and casual creepiness.	Unlike the Craven film, there's little of the audience implication that made these visions of violated innocence and draining retribution so troubling.	Just another meaningless horror movie.	Excessive and gory, this remake lacks the intellectual punch of the 1972 original.
Earnest but amateurish.	Facing the Giants feels like an overly earnest church sketch of the type many evangelical congregations use as a teaching tool on Sunday between the worship music and pastor's message.	The religious proselytizing in this football movie is about as subtle as a blindside hit by a 300-pound defensive end.	Kendrick needs to learn that didacticism isn't a film aesthetic.	By preaching to the converted so heavy-handedly, the filmmakers fumble an opportunity to reach beyond their target demo of devout churchgoers.	The tropes of both football and evangelical movies are gracelessly on parade in this banal, insipid drama.
In reworking genres without quoting shamelessly, Refn proves himself his own man and a guy quite capable of taking us places we didn't even know we wanted to go.	"Drive" builds extraordinary tension before exploding in brief outbursts of shocking violence, almost in the mode of a samurai film.	Mainstream audiences will probably be confounded by "Drive," while lovers of gritty filmmaking will defend every exaggerated shotgun wound as art. Know which camp you're in before you enter the theater.	A silent psychopath with a heart of gold.	But while major elements of the core setup are common and generic the resulting film is anything but... Drive is pure genius in a white satin jacket.	With its hyper-stylized blend of violence, music, and striking imagery, Drive represents a fully realized vision of arthouse action.
I envy kids the discovery they're about to make, about the power of movies to dominate the imagination, to air our secret fears and desires, to become cornerstones of our psyches.	A nice film with some sparkling moments; however, I had expected an overall zappier stream of wand light and more heart.	It may be long, but it's not boring.	You can't expect perfection from muggles.	This manages to keep not just the heart of the story, but the characters and the storyline intact--and make it work on the screen.	Being so faithful to the book is both the movie's strength and weakness. The movie unfolds exactly as written in the book, so there is little room for surprises or discoveries. For Potter fans, what more can you ask for?
A Slow Burn of Fincher Goodness	Zodiac gets under your skin to the point you'll be dying to know who the killer is.	Zodiac is all about Fincher's personal enthusiasms and obsessions. It takes a mighty big ego to steal the show from a serial killer. Apparently, Fincher's just the guy for the job.	Not until well into its second hour does it settle on a theme: the need to know the truth, and the dismal toll of that futile obsession.	...sturdy performances from a pedigreed cast...	A quiet, dialogue-driven thriller that delivers with scene after scene of gut-wrenching anxiety. David Fincher also spends more time illustrating nuances of his characters and recreating the mood of the 70s than he does on gory details of murder.
Only a select few of [Monty Python's] truest fans will appreciate the message they convey in a movie that actively mocks the concept of organized religion while making us laugh along with them.	The Pythons are enlightened jesters, whose scorn is reserved for those who persist in walking in darkness.	Movies just don't really come much funnier than this.	Comic divinity.	Boys of my generation memorize the Monty Python repertoire as a buttress against the terror of losing their virginity.	One of the more cutting=edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.
Offers a poignant, intimate portrait of a larger-than-life personality-one whose singular voice is still sorely needed in music, culture and, well, everywhere.	Doc offers revelations alongside an invigorating recap of Hanna's influential career.	Kathleen Hanna, former lead singer of Bikini Kill, comes across as an inspirational figure in Sini Anderson's rousing documentary.	A fascinating, affectionate profile with Hanna's husband and former Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz, singer Joan Jett and music writer Kim Gordon in the queue to pay tribute to the riotous grrrl.	A rousing celebration of the creative and political life of outspoken Riot grrrl icon, Kathleen Hanna.	It verges on hagiography, but given the deeply compelling nature of its subject's story, The Punk Singer can be forgiven its lack of objectivity.
It's PG-rated summer popcorn fluff at its best, and while the new additions might irritate the hardcore FF fanatics, those simply looking for a check-your-brain-at-the-door night out at the movies will certainly surf away satisfied.	When Jessica Alba was at the MTV Movie Awards she called Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer the best family/comedy of the summer. That alone should spell disaster for a superhero film.	click for full review	If not exactly meriting the term "fantastic" yet, this second installment is a slight improvement over the first film. Things take off more quickly, Reed Richards is less dour and the villain is the Silver Surfer, cooler and more intruiging. The premise	Kids will probably have a blast - but pity their parents having to explain afterwards what exactly those American federal agents were doing torturing a gurneyed prisoner in a secret Siberian base.	While an improvement on its predecessor, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is nevertheless a juvenile, simplistic picture that has little benefit beyond its special effects.
It's the canine players who carry the movie and will capture the hearts of viewers young and old.	Eight Below is dazzling to look at, and nicely intercuts the human relationships with the pooches' awesome struggles to stay alive in the white, wintry wild.	a solid, if a by-the-numbers, piece of work that gets you at an emotional level	A Kleenex-producing tale of survival and friendship that may just make you grab your favorite pooch and promise you'll never leave him/her stranded in the frozen wastelands.	There are human beings in this movie and they are fine, but it is the magnificent four-legged actors who give this movie its bite.	Featuring a stellar cast of marooned mutts, who deftly display emotion, tenderness, loyalty and resolve, Eight Below is a heartwarming and exhilarating adventure film.
A rousing, captivating and heartfelt sports drama filled with terrific performances. It's a knockout!	The Fighter is not an edgy movie, but it doesn't need to be. It [...] transfixes us with flesh and blood characters that never pull their punches.	This boxing film has us rooting for a working-class hero who struggles to find his style in the ring and outside the ring within his dysfunctional family.	adheres too closely to the formulaic blueprint hammered out by Sylvester Stallone's Rocky nearly 35 years ago.	Chopin playing Chopsticks.	Led by a trio of captivating performances from Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Amy Adams, The Fighter is a solidly entertaining, albeit predictable, entry in the boxing drama genre.
Subtle, funny and touching.	What Bernal and this well-wrought movie convey so well is the charisma that would soon become a part of human history and, yes, T-shirts.	I was inspired and taken by this tale of the road...	Intelligent and beautiful, a fascinating journey through the social landscape that shaped the political consciousness of one of history's most romantic figures.	For most of the viewers, regardless of their political beliefs, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is a journey worth taking.	The Motorcycle Diaries is heartfelt and profound in its rendering of the formative experiences that turn Ernesto "Che" Guerva into a famous revolutionary.
Well depicts the darker side of our ephemeral, celebrity- worshipping culture.	On a strictly mechanical level, even skateboard fanatics likely will find it embarrassingly self-congratulatory.	Works effectively as a comprehensive biopic and as a cautionary tale, with wider applications, about the dangers of going too far too fast.	Unlike Stacy Peralta's romantically nostalgic '70s skate-umentary Dogtown & Z Boys, Stickler delves into the dirty details, even showing the decomposed remains of his victim.	A near-perfect time capsule of a specific moment in our culture, and a telling analysis of instant celebrity and the fickleness of youth culture.	The harder they come, the harder they fall -- this film shows, in raw, gripping detail, that even skater dudes can't resist the life of the rich and famous. It's more poignant than hard-core, and gives us a portrait of a life run over by the whims of the entertainment industry.
At least the parents won't regret having sat in the theater for an hour and a half.	...unusually enjoyable.	has far more energy, wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a "2" at the end of its title.	An enjoyable film for the family, amusing and cute for both adults and kids.	If it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original, then SL2 does just that.	Stuart Little 2 is a sweet, visually impressive sequel that provides wholesome entertainment for kids.
A small, dark, simple love story with big, burning, complex emotions. If this really is Phoenix's final performance, it's one hell of a way to go.	...plods along in a sort of mopey fog...	A wonderful character-driven drama about a man caught between what he has and what he wants.	It's a triangle movie that encompasses three moods and varieties of love (and how they all bleed into each other): domestic, romantic, erotic.	A dismal cine-splotch about depressed losers in outer Brooklyn by writer-director James Gray.	Two Lovers is a complex, intriguing, richly-acted romantic drama
Embracing every level of French society, from the aristocratic hosts to a poacher turned servant, the film presents a hilarious yet melancholic picture of a nation riven by petty class distinctions.	Defined a style of filmmaking as surely as Potemkin did. Renoir's lucid style manifests itself in a seemingly effortless craftsmansip still unequalled today.	Like the very greatest artists in all media, Renoir was able to transcend his own perspective, his own prejudices, and glimpse something of the terror and wonder of human life, the pain of misapplied or rejected love, for rich as for poor.	Welcome to The Rules of the Game, Jean Renoir's delightful, frothy, bittersweet masterpiece about romance, class and manners.	If you think you know it, see it again for its newly rediscovered depth of field, and even more, for its infinite wellsprings of character and empathy.	Its genius escaped many viewers at the time, but in retrospect, The Rules of the Game stands as one of Jean Renoir's -- and cinema's -- finest works.
I loved this movie. I loved it for giving the finger to what so many American thrillers have become. Instead of coming off an assembly line, here is a thriller that's fresh and different, focused and smart. It has a European sensibility.	In terms of tone, character and fatalism, an American rendition of Jean-Pierre Melville's seminal existential Euro-noirs.	A life of coldblooded murder tends to be bad for the soul? Who knew?	The American's muted pleasures rest heavily on the sustained air of mystery around Clooney, and Corbijn, a pristine stylist, keeps the atmosphere nice and thick.	Artfully conceived, existential, Euro-style thriller has everything except thrills	As beautifully shot as it is emotionally restrained, The American is an unusually divisive spy thriller -- and one that rests on an unusually subdued performance from George Clooney.
Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are given a lot of one-liners and payoff gags, of course, but what's funny is the stuff that comes in between -- the real affection with which they embrace each other, and the way they delight in their unspeakable lifestyle.	The comedy has moved into high gear and become one of the funniest, most mean-spirited satirical assaults on sunny American values since the salad days of W.C. Fields.	Addams Family Values turns out to be both a trick and a treat.	This delightful follow-up to The Addams Family is blessed with an even blacker vein of humour than the original.	When the film tries to advance a plot it loses most of its energy and humor, and tells a rather weak story. It is only when the story-telling comes to a full halt for the sake of a joke that the film is really funny.	New, well-developed characters add dimension to this batty satire, creating a comedy much more substantial than the original.
An enthralling, timeless documentary. It's the closest you'll ever get to actually being there.	This is a picture that devotees of the American theatre will cherish.	I can think of no higher compliment than to report that after seeing it, I wanted to rush out and see a play.	If you love the theater, you've got to see the film and simply enjoy as everyone from A (Edie Adams) to Z (Karen Ziemba) holds forth.	What could easily have been a sentimental, fannish exercise in musty nostalgia is in fact a lovely tribute to an era of feverish creativity that seemed as though it would never end yet now lives only in memory.	Broadway: The Golden Age is a breezy, affectionate tribute to a sparkling array of the era's best and brightest.
Kidman's performance keeps you transfixed all the way through, because she delves into her character's damaged psyche so fully, you're constantly fascinated to see what biting, acidic thing she will say next.	Margot at the Wedding is a good film that's painful to sit through, and Margot is a protagonist who's virtually sympathy-free.	Margot at the Wedding is a story told from a perspective that's as viciously condescending and critical as Margot's own worldview.	The odiousness of [Baumbach's] protagonists ... isn't as problematic a factor as is the redundancy (and occasional mean-spiritedness) of his psychological portraits.	Never fully coheres or convinces.	Despite a great cast, the characters in Margot at the Wedding are too unlikable to enthrall viewers.
...intelligent, stately paced film	Audience is almost bound to be absorbed for the duration.	Molds the past, present, and future into a tapestry of the cyclical nature of human suffering.	Holm is brilliant as the detached outsider with a cold and calculated agenda, and Polley is mesmerizing as one of the surviving school children.	Elegiac and yet straightforward as haiku	Director Atom Egoyan examines tragedy and its aftermath with intelligence and empathy.
The story is consistently fascinating (though it certainly plays rather fast and loose with historical facts) whilst Hooper manages to wring dramatic tension out of some of the most seemingly mundane incidents.y.	Movies love odd couples, and The King's Speech offers up a regal one in the voiceless monarch and his insistent teacher and confidant, Lionel, who wins a place in the abject Bertie's heart that few in his family are seen to have done.	The power of The King's Speech comes from its performances. Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter have been perfectly cast.	Straight from the school of Inspirational Tales from History, what it lacks in novelty it makes up for in executing this type of movie-making about as well as it can be done.	The rumours are completely true. The superlatives are completely justified. Colin Firth really does give the performance of his life as the Queen's father, George VI.	Colin Firth gives a masterful performance in The King's Speech, a predictable but stylishly produced and rousing period drama.
Works as a stand alone classic that features John Carpenter at his best.	Loads of fun from the usually strained John Carpenter.	A inspired and slightly unhinged homage to grindhouse B-moviemaking.	On the commentary track, Russell and Carpenter provide one of the best bantering sessions I've ever heard	Big rave in little blurb!	Brimming with energy and packed with humor, Big Trouble in Little China distills kung fu B-movies as affectionately as it subverts them.
Utterly compelling portrait of a singular artist and survivor.	"Marwencol" is inspiring but also insightful because it refuses to gloss over complex, even discomfiting questions surrounding its endearing but troubled central character.	Jeff Malmberg's documentary does an amazing job of turning this small patch of dollhouses into a vibrant world of its own, utilizing Hogancamp's own extraordinary pictures of Marwencol's inhabitants to great effect.	Marwencol shows a process of self-imagining and storytelling that reflects the intricate ways that we all understand ourselves, the worlds inside and around us.	Mark, who is on camera much of the time, comes across as an amiable burn-out case, primitivist, artist, obsessive childman, battered soul, horny guy, charming, weird and, by the way, a collector and wearer of women's high heels.	Inspiring and fascinating, Marwencol depicts its subject with heartfelt tenderness, raising poignant questions about art and personal tragedy along the way.
There's a trenchant cultural critique lurking beneath its occasionally cloying melodrama.	A sweeter and more believable version of Steel Magnolias, Middle Eastern style.	Taken together, the women tell a universal story about the beauty and battles of daily life.	It's a warm midwinter treat.	Caramel finds a big-hearted, Mira Nair-ish groove. The characters are gorgeous. And [director] Labaki gets terrific performances out of a largely nonprofessional cast.	Caramel is both an astute cultural study, and a charming comedic drama from a talented newcomer.
Enjoyable, frequently tense and superbly directed chase thriller with strong performances and spectacular photography throughout.	Finally recalls a less convincing version of those of Anthony Mann which managed realism and the mythic without a false note.	A solid but formulaic throwback.	A tough and extraordinarily effective film, at least until it pretty much falls apart in its last half-hour.	An unremarkable revenge/chase western, bolstered by its name cast, matter-of-fact violence and Toll's pristine photography. Eventually a little pretentious - with Anjelica Huston's cameo the nadir - but if you love oaters, it's just worth the time.	A brutal, slow-moving drama that unfolds among some great-looking scenery.
It's not worth the quality time you could be spending with your children or the extra change in your wallet.	Though it aims to be a sharply humorous look at the mommy wars, I Don't Know How She Does It has nothing remotely new or comical in its arsenal.	The result is like that bake sale pie: All the ingredients are there, but it's really sloppy and not quite fresh.	We know how she does it. The better question is: Why should we care?	I not only have nothing nice to say about this movie, but it also is so bad it is a struggle to say anything about it at all.	A limp comedy with a hopelessly outdated viewpoint on gender, featuring Sarah Jessica Parker in rote Carrie-mode.
This film showed the world that a major talent had arrived on the scene.	Terrific. Top shelf talent at the top of their game, working immediately before they would change Hollywood.	Passionate, energetic, stylistically inventive and personally driven, it is the first mature, full blooded "Martin Scorsese Film."	The movie's blazing energy is still astounding; the vérité street-scenes are terrific and Scorsese's pioneering use of popular music is genuinely thrilling.	"Mean Streets" is more than a rambunctious time capsule of Italian American experience, it is groundbreaking film that announces the career of a truly original voice in world cinema.	Mean Streets is a powerful tale of urban sin and guilt that marks Scorsese's arrival as an important cinematic voice and features electrifying performances from Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro.
Spielmann sets a tone of weary desperation and rarely strays from it. Not a happy film, but a gripping one.	A modern fable which draws broad parallels and depicts profound moral quandaries with an elegance and frankness rare in cinema.	As good a thriller as you'll see this year.	Through intelligent formalism, [director] Spielmann crafts a penetrating perception of the world and human experience.	A film of carefully strained pulp and rigorously controlled intrigue, the Austrian revenge drama Revanche, which is really about the dividing line between vengeance and forgiveness, belongs to a neo-noir universe where all the classical genre laws apply.	With Revanche, Götz Spielmann has crafted a debut as surprising as it is suspenseful.
An exquisitely photographed work of serious philosophical heft which tackles some knotty issues: the divide between the intellectual and working classes, older men and younger women, and believers and non-believers.	Winter Sleep is an engrossing work, a finely observed portrait of collapsing social contracts, public and private.	It demands patience and attentiveness, but...reveals a great deal about the reality of the human condition through its probing characterization and pungent dialogue.	In many ways, Ceylan turns Aydin's hotel into a model ant colony where we can watch pockets of activity in isolation, and with its earthen cavities and clay cubbyholes, it's an image that fits, right down to the struggle for power.	In a career trajectory that has continually taken him in the direction of more expansive, audacious cinema, this is the filmmaker's most daring and aesthetically ambitious project yet.	Epic in length, thrilling to behold, and utterly absorbing, Winter Sleep demands -- and rewards -- viewers' patient attention.
A suspenseful, well-acted thriller, though there are certainly some disturbing elements to it. The very R-rated language alone may be enough to turn off some viewers.	a riveting crime drama, wisely populated with a top-shelf cast and based on a harrowing Dennis Lehane novel.	Enigmatic - with a challenging conclusion that's bound to ignite conversation after the lights go on.	By marrying an intense thriller with bigger issues and a three-dimensional lead, Gone Baby Gone isn't only hard-hitting, it's also meaningful, emotional and resonating.	The old maxim about the road to Hell literalized in this exceptional procedural.	Ben Affleck proves his directing credentials in this gripping dramatic thriller, drawing strong performances from the excellent cast and bringing working-class Boston to the screen.
Bong dredges up dread from the mousy determination of Hye-ja's Miss Marple-like detective work -- her meekness hides an astonishing fortitude...	You've never met a mother quite like this one.	This is an extraordinary film in so many ways.	Director Bong continues to be on par with Park Chan-wook, Kim Ki-Duk and other (Korean filmmakers) in terms of pushing the envelope in what can be done with storytelling on film.	A superbly well-assembled film with surprises in store every step of the way.	As fleshy as it is funny, Bong Joon-Ho's Mother straddles family drama, horror and comedy with a deft grasp of tone and plenty of eerie visuals.
At some point, the social mores that functionally banned most other forms of ethnic stereotyping will catch up with the Slavs, a sad day indeed for middling screenwriters.	Everything about the movie is sub-sitcom level.	This corny action comedy isn't just lame on the Jackie Chan scale. It's lame on the George Lopez scale. That's bad.	The closing credit outtakes are the best part of this feeble effort.	It's a sad day for Jackie Chan fans when the action-comedy star is reduced to a vehicle as lame as The Spy Next Door.	Lacking a script funny enough to cover up for Jackie Chan's fading physical gifts, The Spy Next Door fails on every conceivable level.
It won't win any prizes, but for fans of old-time Westerns, it may be a pleasant-enough diversion.	A bit of a mess, but it's not unenjoyable and it boasts a kind of absurd sincerity that's actually rather appealing.	Hats. Lots of great Western hats are about all there is to Texas Rangers.	As dull as its title.	This old-fashioned Western about the glory years of the Texas Rangers, cast with fresh-faced, telegenic young actors whose performances range from adequate to awful, is undermined by a serious lack of true grit.	As far as westerns go, Texas Rangers is strictly mediocre stuff.
A madcap, inventive, and wonder-inducing creation about the arts of living from the inimitable writer and director Wes Anderson.	While The Grand Budapest Hotel is delightfully good fun, it's the moments of pathos and black humour that reveal the scope of its achievements.	The film that Wes Anderson was born for.	Anderson's script is sharp and funny, and never bashful about pausing the laughs for such melancholic reflections, mostly to grieve the loss of a time and place, and occasionally the people.	The Grand Budapest Hotel brought out my inner Hunca Munca, of Two Bad Mice fame: This meticulously appointed dollhouse of a movie just went on and on, making me want to smash many miniature plates of plaster food in frustration.	Typically stylish but deceptively thoughtful, The Grand Budapest Hotel finds Wes Anderson once again using ornate visual environments to explore deeply emotional ideas.
Ultimately, this road movie calls on too many knee-jerk reactions: its shocking and funny scenes rely squarely on role reversals within a traditionally male genre.	Okay, so it's a bit of a hamfisted approach to putting feminism in an action setting. Still, not bad.	Scott has balanced action, comedy and doomy subtext to create a morally firm yet very entertaining fable that reaches out to an audience far larger than its natural feminist constituency.	Ridley Scott in rare form. Chick power!	A rousing road movie about the journey of self-discovery of two women	Simultaneously funny, heartbreaking, and peppered with action, Ridley Scott's Thelma & Louise is a potent, well-acted road movie that transcends the feminist message at its core.
A picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky, spirited fashion.	This movie is by no means a classic in absolute artistic terms, but as a reaffirmation of all but forgotten verities it's an unqualified success.	It's probably the best cartoon that the studio has released since Mulan.	Smart, poignant, and utterly beguiling.	Lilo & Stitch could be considered a safe and amiable vehicle for the powers-that-be at the Disney stable. But that's probably this movie's main downfall--it's TOO safe in a time where the sophisticated outlook of cinema is progressive	Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.
Is it really ethical for a film to warn of the irresistible appeal of online snuff films while it simultaneously indulges, practically pornographically, in graphic displays of the same sort of kinky perversion?	Geeky, gruesome and repugnant.	A diverting police procedural.	In case you didn't catch it, the moral is that each time we indulge our inner voyeur by visiting macabre websites or tuning into salacious tabloid news, we're implicated in the larger cultural crime.	A serviceable, hypocritical thriller that would have been an utter bore-fest if not for Diane Lane.	Despite Diane Lane's earnest effort, Untraceable manages to be nothing more than a run-of-the-mill thriller with a hypocritical message.
It moves and it heals, finding hints of redemption in the jagged face of life.	A Sundance hit that is both absorbing and bleak, Frozen River is anchored by powerful performances, believable scenarios and excellent writing.	Hunt's adoption of a quiet, earthy tone is true to the pace and coldness of life, imparting a laudable absence of driveling sentiment that would undoubtedly have taken over in the hands of a lesser storyteller.	...the icy river isn't the only thing that doesn't flow...	It's Leo, with her pained and battered magnetism - half-pleading, half screw-you - who shakes the film out of its occasional glibness, notching up the performance of her career in thrilling, hungry style.	Veteran character actress Melissa Leo delivers a stunning performance in this powerful -- if grim -- indie film.
An excellent, twisted, funny film back when Burton didn't get in the way of his own filmmaking.	One of the all-time great ghost movies, and certainly the funniest.	funny and completely twisted	Darkly humorous and visually inventive, Burton's second film, which deservedly won the Makeup Oscar, fulfilled the promise he showed in his debut, launching a brilliant career with Batman and other original movies, many of which starring Johnny Depp.	a vehicle perfectly tailored for Burton's peculiar eye	Brilliantly bizarre and overflowing with ideas, Beetlejuice offers some of Michael Keaton's most deliciously manic work - and creepy, funny fun for the whole family.
The Exorcist (1973) is the sensational, shocking horror story about devil possession and the exorcism of the demonic spirits from a young, innocent girl (of a divorced family)	Catholic propaganda? Perhaps. But it's one hell of a movie.	A story of surprising intelligence and spiritual power, undiminished over 27 years.	The 11 minutes aside, what really makes this version worth catching on the big screen is the enhanced print. Digital cleaning has given shape and (horrific) form to the subliminal images peppered throughout.	...Still a thrill to watch after all these years, so full it's hard to absorb in one showing, so affecting it will still keep you awake at night. But maybe for different reasons.	The Exorcist has withstood the test of time, and it still has that renegade feel and the power to shock.
Beyond the excellence of the young actors, however, the film offers little we haven't seen before.	Tigerland is tightly constructed and culminates with a stunningly appropriate charge of ambiguity.	I wouldn't put Tigerland in the top ranks of war movies, but it's a solid second-tier entry that makes you think about the characters.	Tigerland will only reinforce one of the biggest complaints regarding Schumacher's work: that it's all about the look, not the material.	The narrative is weak, with the film consisting of a series of incidents that don't seem to be consistently connected.	A great cast and the gritty feel of the film help elevate Tigerland above the familiarity of the subject matter.
The rest of Burlesque plays like an extended version of the "Lady Marmalade" video, with a few contrivances to provide vague conflict.	There's a chance you'll like the film. Perhaps if you're Christina Aguilera's mom or the spirit of Sonny Bono reincarnated as a person who can tolerate awful movies.	In essence, an update of an old Warner Bros. backstage musical, spiced with the ersatz-'Cabaret' naughtiness of its insular neo-burlesque club setting (complete with a barely utilized Alan Cumming as a Joel Grey-like eminence fey).	Makes one long for its NC-17-rated forefather, 1995's Showgirls.	The dialogue falls upon the ear like baseball bats.	Campy and clichéd, Burlesque wastes its talented cast (including a better-than-expected Christina Aguilera) on a movie that wavers uncertainly between "bad" and "so bad it's good."
While it is true that time, and the obsessive culture of the Internet, has lessened Waterworld's "Fishtar" reputation to some extent, this is still one massively flawed film.	The story and dialogue provided by Peter Rader and David Twohy are surprisingly insubtantial.	Has the makings of a cult movie.	Just another special effects-laden, digitally enhanced, B-movie, adventure thriller.	Costner and Hopper give good characterizations. The entire movie, unfortunately, doesn't quite deliver the punch it ought to.	Though it suffered from toxic buzz at the time of its release, Waterworld is ultimately an ambitious misfire: an extravagant sci-fi flick with some decent moments and a lot of silly ones.
There's plenty of action-packed sequences. But left in the cutting room was the substance needed to balance this film, which was just a hodgepodge of blah.	All fireballs and flat characters.	The real losers are those folks tricked into forking over good money to see this dumbed-down adaptation of the popular comic book.	Like nearly all action movies, horror films, and thrillers in the last 15 years, a sense of motion is conveyed predominately with editing as opposed to through physical space. The compression of time, distance, and movement into hectic cuts is deadening.	What distinguishes this from a standard-issue action comedy is the comedy. The script by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt keeps the killer lines flying as fast as the bullets.	The Losers is loud, fast, and unrelentingly violent -- but it's also funny and well-acted, which will make all the difference for some action fans.
The child himself is never strong enough as an individual presence to anchor the story.	A welcome if somewhat familiar picture.	As downbeat as some of Loach's movies are, they never sink to such overwrought, melodramatic depths or rely on as many unbelievable plot contrivances as does Liam.	Stephen Frears makes every note count for a lot in this beautifully gauged microcosm of big emotions expressed in small gestures.	its flaws and release behind a similar, higher profile work place it in the minor leagues	Though Liam's harrowing story is reminiscent of Angela's Ashes, it showcases strong performances, including one by child actor Anthony Borrows.
Bright, sassy, bouncy and short. You can't ask much more from an animated film.	There's nothing terribly new about this animated Disney feature, but it's still engaging good fun.	A brightly amusing romp, which can truly be recommended for the entire family in that time-honored (but somewhat neglected these days) Disney tradition.	Maggie, Mrs. Calloway and Grace are heroines of a rather pedestrian story line, and they make it seem better and fresher than it actually is with their sweetly adversarial gibes and loose, ad-lib-like delivery.	The writing of co-directors Will Finn and John Sanford and their characterizations are embarrassingly bad for a straight-to-theater Disney movie.	Though Home on the Range is likeable and may keep young children diverted, it's one of Disney's more middling titles, with garish visuals and a dull plot.
Could be the ultimate Hanks movie, and may also help women understand why so many males are immature.	...an agreeable yet unremarkable piece of work.	As far as the movie's message is considered -- if only grown-ups could be more like kids -- Jerry Lewis did an infinitely better job of plugging it in the 50s.	Splendid comedy; Hanks' breakthrough role	Thanks almost exclusively to Tom Hanks, "Big" is far and away the best "age-switch" flick out there.	Refreshingly sweet and undeniably funny, Big is a showcase for Tom Hanks, who dives into his role and infuses it with charm and surprising poignancy.
A fascinating look at an extraordinary personality.	What's fascinating and frustrating about The Island President is how it reveals international politics to be even more polarized and mired in bureaucracy than local politics.	Primary meets environmental documentary. A must-see now that political strife has forced the film's subject, President Mohamed Nasheed, to resign.	If you are in a fight, you want this man on your side. He is charismatic, brave and most of all entirely believes in what he is what he is doing. I'm not sure he know the meaning of the word compromise.	The haunting "How to Disappear Completely" plays over the closing credits. If Nasheed isn't able to wake up the world to his country's plight, in a few decades, that could be the new Maldives national anthem.	An eye-opening and appealing documentary about an earnest politician up against the closed door drama of climate change.
Balancing the political and the personal is a smart idea, though the resulting togglethon ends up being the uneasiest of marriages.	Trumbo emerges as a son's bittersweet valentine to his old man, and a tribute to the senior Trumbo's resilience, wit, and outrage in the face of a national disgrace.	Trumbo is an unconventional film about an unconventional man.	Trumbo is well worth seeing for what it tells us about the age in which this irrepressible individualist lived, loved, suffered and finally triumphed.	This may be the last film to feature Trumbo's writing and it has some of his most powerful prose. It is may be the best film that has ever been made about the Hollywood blacklist and the Hollywood Ten.	Trumbo celebrates the life and work of blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo with measures of humor and sadness.
The darkly realistic cinematography of Michael Simmonds gives the film a near-documentary style in its depiction of the endless, physically draining work.	Although the acting isn't so hot from the non-professional bit part players, Ahmad Ravzi - also a non-professional actor and former push cart seller himself - puts in a stoic and solid performance.	Man Push Cart is a solemn mood piece that hovers somewhere between bittersweet and despairing.	It's a very sad film and very well done.	If one of the things movies are supposed to do is make you look anew at the world around you, you may never see your doughnut vendor in the same way again.	This compassionate portrait of a New York City street vendor is as beautiful as it is melancholy.
As a result, he has not only been able to stick two fingers up to the anti-Pole hate-mongers of the popular press, and to create an enchanting portrait of growing up in a British city; he has made his best film to date.	Another beautifully crafted film, as well as a great London film, from the finest British director working today.	Sweet...at times reminiscent of "Y Tu Mama Tambien."	Meadows in a minor key but still a major delight; his improvised feel, sparky comedy and interest in the truth of youth services a story that's both winning and winsome.	Shane Meadows has been busily carving out his own corner in British cinema.	Shane Meadows hits the spot with this short but sweet slice of good natured comedy, surprisingly, as it's essentially an extended black & white advert for a train station.
Long title. Waaay too long a movie. Other than that, it's flawless entertainment.	Given the film's origins, it seems fitting that by the time the movie is two hours old, Pirates becomes a ride one desperately wants to get off.	Certainly, Pirates has its moments. But it's definitely no 'E' ticket.	'The Haunted Mansion' with Eddie Murphy is scheduled for Thanksgiving. No word yet about possible movies based on the Enchanted Tiki Room or the spinnning teacups...	Pirates of the Caribbean is an entertaining, swashbuckling adventure that will leave audiences wanting a sequel.	May leave you exhausted like the theme park ride that inspired it; however, you'll have a good time when it's over.
Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-Semitism ever seen on screen.	The film is no fun, but Bean handles it with an unflinching courage that is matched by Gosling's seething performance.	An important movie, a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values.	Gosling projects a feral intelligence that is riveting...	It made for an emotionally hair-pulling ride, without benefit of much intellectual give and take.	Gosling commands the screen with a raw, electrifying performance.
As a nature doc alone, Encounters at the End of the World would stand as one of the year's best. But it is the people who choose to live and work at the very ends of the Earth that are Herzog's real subject.	Seemingly off-hand, cumulatively imposing, utterly masterful.	A poem of oddness and beauty. Herzog is like no other filmmaker, and to return to him is to be welcomed into a world vastly larger and more peculiar than the one around us. The underwater photography alone would make a film, but there is so much more.	This mystical, cynical, hypocritical elegy is his return to the deep after his somnolent The Wild Blue Yonder, and like it, plunges into the unique territory of Herzog's mind	It is a sublime pleasure to spend time with [Werner Herzog] and "Encounters at the End of the World" is a trip from start to finish.	Encounters at the End of the World offers a poignant study of the human psyche amid haunting landscapes.
A big, meaty monster movie that's as entertaining for its Lovecraftian beasties as it is for its more "intellectual" aspirations.	This is a flawless horror movie.	Dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact.	The black-and-white version's stark contrasts give greater claustrophobic force to the fragility of civilization when ideology grows as deadly as any marauding beasts. Prepare also to be knocked cold and gut-kicked for good measure by its ending.	It'll rock you to the core.	Frank Darabont's impressive camerawork and politically incisive script make The Mist a truly frightening experience.
This generational touchstone remains a playful widescreen fable of the bestiality that defines and destroys cultures.	Weird combination of heavy-handed allegory and campy fun	Back in 1968, this sci-fi, directed by Schaffner and penned by Wilson and Serling, was original, quite intelligent , and well executed, garnering a special Oscar for makeup.	...an above-average science-fiction movie in spite of its contrived plot, stilted acting, forced allegory, and unconvincing makeup.	Planet of the Apes is one of those rare films whose historical impact outweighs its quality. It's a good film, but not a classic.	Planet of the Apes raises thought-provoking questions about our culture without letting social commentary get in the way of the drama and action.
The adult sex comedy is making a comeback.	So why can't they make more of these R-rated comedies?	A good-hearted entertainment with real crossover appeal. Successful enough to leave viewers with a warm feeling inside and a smile on their face.	The 40 Year-Old Virgin is the thinking person's raunchy comedy.	A bracingly coarse, surprisingly tender movie.	Steve Carell's first star turn scores big with a tender treatment of its titular underdog, using raunchy but realistically funny comedy to connect with adult audiences.
A stand-up-and-cheer story that doesn't feel like it's pushing butts out of seats.	Dante's Inferno: Mulroney mesmerizes in this equal opportunity icon smasher. Just let it be said that I entered a dark wooden puppet movie and laughed till it hurt. Now there's a novel notion of pleasure as punishment.	Flash of Genius is a moving film - although definitely not a feel-good epic - that's well-paced, well-written, and superbly acted.	[Greg Kinnear] gives one of the most carefully modulated and moving performances of his career.	"Flash of Genius" is a film that is desperately in search of one--some burst of inspiration that would transform it from the paint-by-numbers inspirational saga that it is into something deeper and better.	The touching underdog story of a single guy against a massive corporation, Flash of Genius is a well-paced and well-written tale with a standout performance by star Greg Kinnear.
Teenage girls (and women getting in touch with their inner teenager) will have a fine time...	Most sequels are worse than the originals. A few are better. Here's one that is exactly as good as the one that inspired it, and that's enough for me.	Sisterhood furthers an honest dialogue among young women, for whom life roads are not always clearly paved. It's definitely not The Baby-Sitters Club -- and that's a good thing.	Pants is less interested in sisterhood and navigating young adulthood than it is in selling glossy girl fantasies of exotic locales and bodacious boyfriends.	A solid if not wholly necessary sequel, but Carmen, Tibby, Lena and Bridget are so pleasant to spend a couple hours with that it hardly matters.	The workable chemistry among the four leads combined with the enriching message make for a winning Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.
There's just no cynicism in this whole story. As if a woman knows how to take a compliment. But this movie allows you to suspend disbelief and buy into a woman who can say thank you.	The Perfect Holiday, directed by Lance Rivera, is that most dispiriting product, a formulaic movie that doesn't believe in itself.	Jovial and junky as all get out, The Perfect Holiday is about what you'd expect from a holiday comedy daring to put 'perfect' in its title. As in anything but.	It's deplorable that these two stars have been reduced to appearing in such garbage.	It's a shame that Gabrielle Union can't get better scripts than this one.	The Perfect Holiday is the perfect example of Christmas movie clichés run amok.
As usual with film noir, however, it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben.	The next best Holmes to Jeremy Brett.	Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters -- the Disney Studio's gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary -- but they will love the cute, brave mice and cheer their triumphs. Adults will enjoy the wit and style.	If the film fails to click on all the emotional levels that Disney might have wanted, at least it's a brightly-paced bit of comedy and fun.	Not classic, but the start of something good.	The Great Mouse Detective may not rank with Disney's classics, but it's an amiable, entertaining picture with some stylishly dark visuals.
This is a film with great heart by a filmmaker with terrific style and an actor with undeniable chops.	Could this be the year that Adam Sandler gets an Oscar nomination?	A happy nightmare of silly-smart movie comedy that defies category -- and challenges expectations involving Sandler and his pictures.	This movie's like no other movie yet it's really interesting.	Surreal, funny, and stylish, Punch-Drunk Love is one of the best movies of 2002	Odd, touching, and unique, Punch-Drunk Love is also delightfully funny, utilizing Adam Sandler's comic persona to explore the life of a lonely guy who finds love.
There's enough slapstick to keep fans of Zucker's Airplane style happy.	An overheated, underdone farce.	A ragged, wildly uneven road comedy.	A scoopful of slapstick silliness that runs refreshingly counter to the bodily fluids and gross-out humor that dominate film comedy today.	Goes for fast and dumb, and dammit if it doesn't connect dead-on with the funnny bone.	Rat Race moves from one sight gag to another, but only a handful of them are genuinely funny.
...there is something touching in the mechanical hauteur of some of the performances.	Bank holiday afternoon fare it might be, but DeMille's remake of his 1923 silent is a marvellous epic of the kind they don't make any more.	DeMille's last film (he died in 1959) is also his biggest, most spectacular epic, excessive and lurid, displaying him as a showman--must see for Hollywood students	It's the gigantic vulgarity, the obsessive righteousness of the director himself, which keeps the show on the road and suffuses the movie with its daft power.	Heston may as well be screaming about Soylent Green, but damn if he doesn't make for one hell of an inspiring leader.	Bombastic and occasionally silly but extravagantly entertaining, Cecil B. DeMille's all-star spectacular is a muscular retelling of the great Bible story.
Call it macho crap. Call it mindless escapism. Call it Stallone's grand posturing. In fact, call it all of the above.	Sylvester Stallone is one of the great physical actors in the movies, with a gift for throwing himself so fearlessly into an action scene that we can't understand why somebody doesn't really get hurt.	A thriller that's actually thrilling. The only Rambo worth watching.	As befits a story of internal conflict, Ted Kotcheff lays out the action in an adroit style derived from Anthony Mann	...does get loonier as it goes along, yet for a while it's actually a mournful and sobering action-movie treatment of postwar stress.	Much darker and sensitive than the sequels it spawned, First Blood is a thrilling survival adventure that takes full advantage of Sylvester Stallone's acting skills.
... heads roll and nail bomb shrapnel turns a headstrong 'survivor' into a pile of pink human brisket with pants. Does this sound like entertainment to you?	There are only so many alternate flashbacks and massive explanations that a horror freak can take ... but I think the series is still amusing enough to warrant 90 minutes a year.	Jigsaw was put out of his misery two movies ago. Lionsgate might want to consider doing this misbegotten series the same favor.	See you next year, I guess. Sigh.	The driving force is inertia and commercial calculation, not inspiration.	If its plot were as interesting as its torture devices, or its violence less painful than its performances, perhaps Saw V might not feel like it was running on fumes.
Taymor ... dips into Frida's imagination intriguingly.	...fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film.	Oddly enough, there's not enough about Frida, but it's still a well-acted and great looking film.	A magical-realist biopic full of real-life pain, passion and love.	...Aptly honors one of the most interesting and tragic love stories in the history of art.	Frida is a passionate, visually striking biopic about the larger-than-life artist.
Poignant, insightful, wryly humorous portrait of American teenage non-conformity -- a wonderful, distinctive film, with a great soundtrack and terrific performances from its three leads. One of the best films of the year.	It is to the film's credit that it treats Enid more seriously than she treats herself, eventually developing her as a dynamic, sympathetic character.	In her need for affection, in her need to be taken seriously, Enid is poignant without ever being cloying.	The better, unpretentious version of The Catcher in the Rye that Salinger never wrote.	Give this weirdly humanitarian picture a try, and don't be surprised if you find yourself smiling through the bummer.	With acerbic wit, Terry Zwigoff fashions Daniel Clowes' graphic novel into an intelligent, comedic trip through deadpan teen angst.
The writers are content to let the magical beings simply run around and crash into things. I got a Jumanji headache about 30 minutes in.	A clever and innovative concept inspired from an illustrated children's book that integrates historic figures and creatures, Night at the Museum could have been a riot, but is reduced to little more than a good idea.	This energetically charmless 'family' fantasy lies there dead on screen, occasionally twitching at a funny line.	It's never too late to enjoy a little holiday fantasy, such as spending a Night at the Museum.	Levy, for his part, keeps the pace brisk and the storytelling simple.	Parents might call this either a spectacle-filled adventure or a shallow and vapid CG-fest, depending on whether they choose to embrace this on the same level as their kids.
The film never quite builds the compulsive emotional power it needs to be an unforgettable personal drama. But it's full of other good stuff.	There is, alas, quite a lot of pidgin drama and comedy.	Properly picturesque but lacks subtlety and substance in blending Chinese and Western history, ideas, and cinematic conventions.	A brew of fine filmmaking, lovely cinematography, dragon's blood and a terrific cast.	The film is as charming as Liu's smile.	Charmingly sweet, Shadow Magic captures the sense of wonder of audiences experiencing the world of motion pictures for the first time.
Audiard, who made the uncompromising prison saga A Prophet, is like a gritty, realist Douglas Sirk - throwing his characters into whirlwind scenarios that are filled with big emotions and fateful turns of events.	Marion Cotillard impresses in this intimate, harsh and realistic study of two troubled souls.	Why are certain films less than the sum of their appealing parts?	Another triumph from Audiard and a Cotillard masterclass, this bruising, tender melodrama lingers long in the memory.	The film achieves what all dramatic films should strive for: complete audience empathy for the main characters. I cared for these two so deeply, and the many, many moments of quiet triumph gave me rushes of joy. A beautiful triumph of precision.	Surging on strong performances from Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, Rust and Bone is as vibrant and messily unpredictable as life itself.
Calle 54 is an engaging sampler of Latin jazz and its permutations.	For much of its 105 minutes, it simply sizzles with sophisticated passion.	There's not been a more infectious jazz performance screen treat since 1959's classic Jazz on a Summer's Day.	The knowledge of the musicians' connection to one another makes it the most touching interlude in an overlong but nevertheless entertaining film.	Lacks history, background and cultural roots, but it's undeniably infectious.	A loving tribute to Latin Jazz artists where music does the talking.
There is a stillness to the film that is initially fascinating, but it wears thin quickly.	... Reygadas has made a sensationalist picture in which all the sensation is willfully dulled.	The only battle I had was deciding whether to watch the whole movie or get out while the getting was good. Unfortunately, I opted to stay to see if it got better... it didn't.	Depicts the spiritual emergency of an amoral man in Mexico City who plunges into despair and turns to sex as a way out of his funk.	If you think that soft-core porno is stimulating, this pic will cure you of that fellat, uh, fallacy.	Though it tries to be provocative, Battle in Heaven is lethargic and mind-numbing.
Endearing stuff punctuated by some genuinely hysterical moments.	...here is a film that is lighthearted and simple, but is made all the more appreciative because of Barrymore's presence...	A lively tribute to the awkwardness and power of adolescent girlhood.	Drew Barrymore is an American treasure.	It's a captivating, totally cool teenage chick's flick.	Unoriginal and unremarkable high school satire adds little to the genre.
Hoffman has cornered the market on playing timid, badly dressed, mouth-breathing sad sacks ... yet it's easy to forget that what gives his loser characters such singular life is their deep-down obsessional fervor.	Atmospheric and never flashy, and yet capable of moments of unbearable tension and an almost overpowering sense of paranoia.	This is a small story, as quiet and unassuming as its main character. And, like Mahowny, it makes few wrong moves and quite a few right ones.	A fascinating and often spot-on look at the dark world of gambling addiction.	The film does a good job of portraying '80s excess -- power suits, leather briefcases, fancy cars.	This story of addiction may lack the typical flash and glamour, but Hoffman makes Mahowny compelling.
...very predictable...	Gives Duff another chance to play a contemporary Cinderella, but she still isn't able to find real character depth. Then again, the script doesn't demand much of her.	Nothing to sing about.	I cared. I cared. Then it was off to therapy. After all, the film's production company, for gosh sakes, is called ChickFlicks. ChickFlicks!	Raise Your Voice is like a Hallmark movie of the week produced by an MTV intern.	A bland, formulaic tween version of Fame.
[A] powerful, thought-provoking and surprisingly well-made film.	The Silence of the Lambs has appalling moments, but there's a thoughtfulness to it that helps offset the horrors it portrays.	Screenwriters and directors can turn to this classic film for a primer on how to create incredible tension and horror far in excess of what we actually see onscreen.	It's good, but it's not quite the classic it's touted as.	The Silence of the Lambs is a psychological thriller of the highest order, and well deserving of the unusual Oscar nod for Best Picture, never before bestowed upon a film like this.	Director Jonathan Demme's smart, taut thriller teeters on the edge between psychological study and all-out horror, and benefits greatly from stellar performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
Good acting, shotmaking and a charismatic lead role alone won't grant you a pass to Kubrick country. Nor even to Costner country.	So inspiring is his message that my own girlfriend channeled it, in the warning I received prior to my reviewing the film: You'd better love it, or I'll disembowel you.	If you prefer your movies to be more than just one man's ego trip, it's an impediment to fully enjoying what is otherwise an awesome-looking and powerful bloody epic.	Mel Gibson's Oscared, bloody Scottish spectacle.	It succeeds in bringing to life the reality of Scottish patriotism and brilliantly captures the spirit of revolution.	Distractingly violent and historically dodgy, Mel Gibson's Braveheart justifies its epic length by delivering enough sweeping action, drama, and romance to match its ambition.
A witty, wry examination of what happens when opposites attract.	The spirit of belonging is delicately captured by one of the film's concluding scenes.	An eloquent, unadorned film of bona fide human susceptibility.	Rich with gentle humor and insight.	A worldly-wise, compassionate and charmingly acted Gallic comedy.	The Taste of Others is a fresh, witty comedy about the attraction of opposites. The characters are well-drawn and engaging and their social interactions believable.
The movie gets a little slow when it settles down for some routine dialogue or plot development, but it's never more than a couple minutes before break time is over and it's back to the insane fighting stunts.	This electrifying movie isn't just a collection of gory moments. It actually goes somewhere.	Extraordinary stunt and fight work and nonstop excitement, but a warning to those who are at all squeamish: this may be the most violent movie I've ever seen.	An electrifyingly kinetic and insanely frenetic action flick stacked with a level of violence at which the makers of Grand Theft Auto would marvel.	Gareth Huw Evans doesn't swipe plot points as much as organically build a taut, expertly choreographed heir to urban mayhem fantasies	No frills and all thrills, The Raid: Redemption is an inventive action film expertly paced and edited for maximum entertainment.
Respect to Clint for putting his cojones on the line to make a 'chick flick,' and utmost respect to him for pulling it off with aplomb.	Outstanding drama. Actually makes a case for adultery. You really feel for them and get sucked into this quiet world.	A dizzy, dusty masterpiece	Most of the plot is predicable after the initial setup and that is okay. The point is not to guess the next plot twist, but to identify with the characters and vicariously live their romance and have that illicit fling you subconsciously always wanted.	The result, if rather thin and certainly far from a masterpiece, is nevertheless quite lovely. This affecting little film is easily one of Eastwood's best efforts as a director.	Sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying, The Bridges of Madison County finds Clint Eastwood adapting a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.
Vibrant colors and finely-crafted backdrops pave the way for characters who, believe it or not, felt more alive in this world than they did back in those old books or cartoons.	Geez, it's not very good. Talky, overpopulated, even the ha-ha so-called adult jokes have grown stale and predictable.	Shrek the Third has its moments. But does a kids' movie really need, among other similar touches, a Hooters joke? I, for one, wouldn't want to have to explain it.	By the time the film ends... we see our heroes Shrek and Fiona exhausted and asleep, the perfect metaphor for how much juice is actually left in this concept.	Another great lesson for the children. When the green is guaranteed, you can put as little effort as possible into your project.	Shrek the Third has pop culture potshots galore, but at the expense of the heart, charm, and wit that made the first two Shreks classics.
It's refreshing to see Hollywood make a movie that isn't dumb, and that doesn't talk down to its audience.	I'm sure that fans of the show were satisfied, but others may find this movie uninvolving and its conspiracy theories juvenile. It's nothing more than a two-hour promotion for the television series that fails to resolve any of the conflicts it introduces.	By the end of the picture I was almost in a frenzy to see the television show, after experiencing this two-hour nostalgic thriller that manages to make use of the limitations the series brought on.	As it is, pic serves up set-pieces and a measure of scope that are beyond TV size but remain rather underwhelming by feature standards.	I want to believe this latest X-Files film was created for a reason other than financial reward, but I find it difficult to guess at what that reason might have been.	Results may vary for newcomers, but fans of the series will enjoy its big-screen transition.
The early 30s crisis certainly looks more tenable if it's unfolding among several European capitals, but the movie lacks the specificity and focus of the first.	[Xavier] turns this film into more of a self-fixated memoir, less of a blithe ensemble piece.	The cast of renegades is as appealing as ever.	Klapisch is daring you to call him sentimental. He is. But, as he proves in a sublime ending, he's magical too.	Resonant with acute and accurate observations of people at that devastating stage in life where the glow and glory of youth is dimming into a dull realisation that fun spelt backwards is 'nuf, Russian Dolls is an achingly bitter sweet film.	Like its predecessor L'Auberge Espagnole, Russian Dolls is charmingly breezy and light.
Time might not have been kind to the look of WarGames, but with nuclear war still a very real threat, the picture's ability to manufacture suspense remains undimmed.	The first half has a sardonic edge to it, but the more seriously the movie takes itself the sillier it gets.	One of the early films to warn about the dangers of hackers and the possibilities of computers controlling our lives.	As tense and effective now as it was 25 years ago. The worry back then was more about Soviet missiles than about credit card identity theft, but good filmmaking techniques haven't changed.	As a Cold War message movie and cinematic descendent of Fail-Safe, WarGames examines the inherent danger in favoring technology's cool logic and situational calculations.	Part delightfully tense techno-thriller, part refreshingly unpatronizing teen drama, WarGames is one of the more inventive -- and genuinely suspenseful -- Cold War movies of the 1980s.
... an incoherent blitz of noise, chintzy special effects and bargain-basement allegory.	What it doesn't have is much of a plot.	A movie where style and pacing are given center stage. The style is comic book and the pacing is fast, fast, fast.	... the filmmakers filled their film with tons of FX, leaving little place to action scenes.	... badly acted and executed.	Spawn is an overbearing, over-violent film that adds little to the comic book adaptation genre.
The film earns a lot of good will because of its enthusiastic cast, impressive choreography, and remarkably fast pace.	Bring It On is the most exuberantly funny and smartest teen movie this summer, which is something to cheer about.	The problem with the film is that others have done its routine before, and have done it better.	For you guys, it's worth a rental. The rest of you may want to stay away, especially if you're diabetic.	This film stands out -- not as an original (its focus on fierce competition is nothing new), but as a well-executed story with likable characters and fresh flourishes.	Despite the formulaic, fluffy storyline, this movie is surprisingly fun to watch, mostly due to its high energy and how it humorously spoofs cheerleading instead of taking itself too seriously.
Studio Ghibli has pulled it out of the bag yet again, offering a miniature corrective to the brash 3D beasts customarily trained on the Haribo demographic.	The Secret World of Arrietty is a marvelously captivating animated feature about very tiny people and the full-scale world they inhabit.	While perfectly pleasant and an entirely suitable option for anyone looking to take small children to the movies, it is a disappointingly minor entry in the annals of Studio Ghibli...	[VIDEO] Prepare to be charmed.	Even when making movies for small children, Studio Ghibli produces stories that are more emotionally sophisticated, and less philosophically polarized, than most adult fare.	Visually lush, refreshingly free of family-friendly clatter, and anchored with soulful depth, The Secret World of Arrietty lives up to Studio Ghibli's reputation.
Good dog. Good dog movie.	You won't have enough paws to hold all the hankies you'll need to sit through My Dog Skip.	Paint -by- numbers stuff.	I had shelved a movie critic's usual reserve and just started identifying with Willie and Skip.	It's a family movie with a heart and a brain. And if you aren't moved to tears, you might need an organ transplant.	Critics say My Dog Skip is cute, wholesome entertainment for the family. It's especially designed to appeal to your sentiment, but you might find yourself choking up just the same.
[Harrison Ford] hasn't been this entertaining in years, actually, and that in and of itself gives "Morning Glory" a pass.	[A] generally woeful comedy.	Morning Glory is a juggernaut. It has one directive: make the audience fall in love with Rachel McAdams by all means necessary.	The film is unique in its revisionary take on the rom-com - it's not love, but love of career. As well as Ford's legendary anchorman, glowering down on info-tainment from a Cronkite-ian cloud of disdain.	When it catches a wave of satire and farce, it's an engrossing, amusing feature, gifted superb comic flight by Michell.	It's lifted by affable performances from its impeccable cast, and it's often charming -- but Morning Glory is also inconsistent and derivative.
Once the movie (and the ringing in your ears) stop, though, it's obvious why Cyrus has become such a phenomenon. She's pretty and stylish but never a mean girl, energetic and popular but not conceited.	A film that opens with celebuspawn Cyrus practising scales and ends with me wrapping my lips around the barrel of a twelve-gauge	Cyrus' fans will receive this material as Moses received those tablets from Mount Sinai.	Some movies are critic-proof -- some for the wrong reasons, some for the right ones. This one falls into the latter camp.	An infectious, high-energy performance picture that overcomes its rather unsavory purpose by barreling forward with a nuclear bomb of tween enthusiasm and vivid displays of over-choreographed celebration.	This high-energy concert film should please Cyrus' rabid pre-teen fan base -- and may come as a pleasant surprise for parents.
Love stories haven't been a big focus in his [Soderbergh] work. But, if it is his final movie, it's worth noting that this is one of his warmest.	Much more than a biopic about Liberace, this expertly assembled film recounts a true love story in a way we rarely see on-screen: with honest humour, real feeling and startling insight.	Behind the Candelabra is a fascinating peek into the secret life of an icon; the sad (reportedly) last hurrah of a cinematic maverick and proof that Douglas and Damon are fabulous.	Even though the film's tagline is "Too much of a good thing is wonderful," for Soderbergh, it winds up being just pretty good.	A film that pays tribute to a complex personality, a genuinely talented entertainer and a very different age from today.	Affectionate without sacrificing honesty, Behind the Candelabra couples award-worthy performances from Michael Douglas and Matt Damon with some typically sharp direction from Steven Soderbergh.
A generally splendid documentary by Marah Strauch about people throwing themselves off cliffs. Literally.	First-time filmmaker Marah Strauch skillfully interweaves the Boenish story -- full of copious vintage footage shot by Carl -- with dramatizations and interviews.	If Sunshine Superman doesn't exactly inspire comprehension of the desire to feel like you're "flashing through a 20-story building in one second," it is immersive enough to induce panic.	Strauch makes a compelling case for the exhilaration of living, and dying, on your own terms, a freedom so few of us ever truly experience.	The subject matter increasingly suggests a kind of cross between "Man On Wire" and "Grizzly Man," but unlike "Grizzly Man" director Werner Herzog, director Strauch has little interrogative spirit. There's no interest in exploring Boenish's contradictions.	Sunshine Superman shines a light on a fascinating life with copious amounts of incredible, thrilling footage.
Ironic, then, that The Invasion, the fourth film to be made from the material, keels over dead, killed by Hollywood conventionality and bland uniformity.	There's much to recommend here. But there are too many inconsistencies.	An effective action thriller that only hints at the psychological complexity the director might have wanted.	Someone should check the basement of the studio for pods.	This movie is too impatient and out of it to express either what makes humans individual or what makes them part of a community in the new millennium.	The Invasion is slickly made, but it lacks psychological insight and thrills.
... a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping, in one way or another, with life's endgame.	Seek it out and nourish your beautiful mind.	Simple, poignant and leavened with humor, it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship.	[T]his beguiling Belgian fable, very much its own droll and delicate little film, has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why.	It's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies, but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette.	Pauline and Paulette is a gently poignant, compassionate tale.
Michael Curtiz's adventure, one of the most enjoyable swashbuckling epics made, flaunting star Errol Flynn at his very best, deservedly won several Oscar Awards, including editing for Dawson and music score for Korngold.	A rousing and fun popcorn movie of the highest order.	If prankish Fairbanks was a man's Robin Hood, handsome, romantic Flynn performs for everybody else.	Few storybooks have been more brilliantly brought to life, page for page, chapter for chapter, derring-do for derring-do.	Errol Flynn stars in swashbuckling family delight.	Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen.
Not only worthy of its fine predecessor, this tender, perceptive, and gorgeously acted memory piece may even surpass it in subtlety, feeling, and depth of characterization.	Truthful and compassionate.	An intelligently written and marvelously acted coming-of-age tale set in rural Australia in the 1960s.	Nowhere near as novel as The Year My Voice Broke....but still worthwhile	If Duigan maintains the dark yet humanistic humor that has graced both films, we should all be back for more.	A terrific follow-up to The Year My Voice Broke, Flirting is a teen movie worth watching, thanks to emotionally engaging performances and an endearing script.
This is 'Scenes from a Marriage' thirty years later.	A good note to end on for a filmmaker renowned for his greatness.	The compositions are stark, the tone wintry and the conversations bleak. Yet there's a flicker of something affirmative in this darkness.	The message is the medium.	The 85-year-old Bergman has proclaimed this his final film and it has the feel of closure. It also feels like the effort of a tired artist reworking the same themes.	If Saraband appears to be a minor entry in Ingmar Bergman's filmography, it's still an accomplished piece of work from one of cinema's greatest masters.
A romantic melodrama that spells doom in the most delicious fashion.	This tragic romance is elegant, picturesque, sensuous, and rather stilted.	This strange movie has a hard time balancing all these elements, but the film's enormous passion overcomes its more obvious melodrama.	A wonderfully entertaining, old-fashioned melodrama of love and war.	Its old-fashioned romanticism is heady, and the relationships among the characters are intriguing.	Gloomy Sunday is beautiful, well-acted, and every bit as downcast as its title.
Leymah Gbowee [is] one of the heroic women interviewed in this fleet, gripping documentary.	Pray the Devil Back to Hell is at once inspiring and horrific.	Limitations aside, it's highly stirring stuff.	The greatest respect Gini Reticker's Pray the Devil Back to Hell pays to its war-battered Liberian subjects is simply an unwillingness to embellish.	Pray The Devil Back To Hell is overly conventional as a documentary, but it's inspiring as a rebuttal to the declining state of the world at large.	This political documentary about protests during the Liberian Civil War is an uplifting celebration of the capacity of everyday people to affect great change.
It's hard to deny that Marlon Brando's performance as a dock worker and ex-fighter who finally decides to rat on his gangster brother (Rod Steiger) is pretty terrific.	a watershed moment in cinema history; it remains one of the greatest films of the 1950s	It is thanks to Brando that this posthumous Popular Front classic is a heart-clutcher from beginning to end.	A hard-hitting but pretentious melodrama about union corruption on the New York docks.	Raises important issues about the nature of power.	With his electrifying performance in Elia Kazan's thought-provoking, expertly constructed melodrama, Marlon Brando redefined the possibilities of acting for film and helped permanently alter the cinematic landscape.
The screenplay... may be the most biting example of hard-boiled wit ever to come out of Hollywood, and it is stylishly performed at a breakneck pace by a uniformly expert cast.	The presence of All About Eve, while a relief, is also a sad reminder of how in certain ways movies have regressed in the past 50 years.	The peerless tale of two rival drama queens, playing as the central attraction in the BFI Southbank's Joseph L Mankiewicz season, and rightly so.	All About Eve is not only a brilliant and clever portrait of an actress, it is a downright funny film, from its opening scene to the final fadeout.	Sanders...was ideally cast in this role: you can feel in Addison's every word the world-weariness of the actor who would eventually commit suicide at age 65...	Smart, sophisticated, and devastatingly funny, All About Eve is a Hollywood classic that only improves with age.
Ice Age will probably get enough kids smiling to earn its big cost back, and then some. And yet there is a safeness here, a corporate sameness, a sense of throwing the public a prehistoric bone, smack into the multiplex cave.	Manages to remain consistently entertaining and delightful throughout.	The movie suffers every time the creatures have to say the words the screenwriters have foisted on them.	Has easily one of the best trailers ever, and that one long sequence shown in the trailer turns out to be the opening scene of the movie.	Young children will enjoy it; accompanying adults will be glad it's only 80 minutes long.	Even though Ice Age is treading over the same grounds as Monsters, Inc. and Shrek, it has enough wit and laughs to stand on its own.
I felt as though I could have gathered the same information about Israel's beginnings from a pamphlet, and saved myself the film's forthright baggage	In its struggle to present an unbiased portrait that balances Jewish and Palestinian viewpoints evenly, the film loses some narrative focus. Nevertheless, it presents a valuable history lesson that points out the dire effects of British occupation in the	It aspires to be an epic drama but suffers from an acute identity crisis: It can't decide if it wants to be history, drama, or a cry for peace in the Mideast.	Hammers away at its Arab/Jewish variation on the chicken-or-the-egg debate ad nauseam.	O Jerusalem is as overstated and expository as a historical pageant, from the drippy music to a sputtering, running gag involving funky old jalopies to clichéd speeches and teary-eyed deaths and a final voice-over crying out for peace.	Though a noble effort, O Jerusalem fails to combine this history lesson and human drama into a coherent cinematic piece.
It's so sweet but it has the cynical heart of pre-WWII America.	There is a real knowledge of human nature beneath the comedy.	With much affectionate humor, A Christmas Story recalls vividly what it was like to be a kid at Christmas in a more innocent era.	A delightful movie.	There's a reason they run this for 24 hours every December -- it really is that good, maybe the best Christmas movie ever.	Both warmly nostalgic and darkly humorous, A Christmas Story deserves its status as a holiday perennial.
It may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice, at least as represented by this case.	Maybe Thomas Wolfe was right: You can't go home again.	This is standard concert-film fare geared to the faithful.	Delves deep into the creative process, unlike almost any film before it, to show where and how producers and rappers come together to make a hit song.	A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine.	An emotionally wrenching portrayal of a family reunion that doesn't turn out as expected.
Whether any of them will live happily ever after is a question you're left pondering long after this challenging film comes to a close.	It's French. It's sexy. It's got a killer soundtrack.	If you ever get a chance to see Happily Ever After at any venue and in any form, drop everything and see it.	A frothy, amusing Parisian romantic comedy.	There's little you haven't seen in any number of French flicks, but then, most of them didn't have Gainsbourg.	Though this French film features good acting, it lacks the wit and charm one would expect to see.
Lynch has slowed the world down and gotten back in touch with it.	Combines humor with deep feeling for a unique and remarkable film journey.	Lynch and legendary cinematographer Freddie Francis have crafted a hauntingly lovely mise-en-scčne.	It's a relaxing film with dull edges.	One of the best pictures of the year.	Slow-paced but heart-warming.
Melvin's story, different from Sweetback's, has to do with marketing that resistance, to make his movie matter.	One is very glad to have Baadasssss! around, if only to remind younger moviegoers that taking chances and breaking rules can reap huge dividends.	This is excellent and well worth the watch for any artist.	Polarizing and potentially galvanizing.	The love radiates off the screen in this cinematic valentine, as Mario pays moving tribute to the influential filmmaker he has the privilege of calling 'Dad.'	An entertaining and intriguing tribute to a father from his son.
The closest to a John Hughes film this generation will get, which is a huge compliment. But, 'The Social Network' is not the defining movie of a generation.	A brilliantly layered film ... another home run for Fincher and about as close to perfection one can hope for with such a complex tale.	Not quite a biopic (inventor Zuckerberg is but 26 years old) and not quite a character study, the movie is best thought of as the portrait of an asshole as a young man.	It may be the year's best movie.	Fincher has delivered his best work since Seven. An even better period drama than Zodiac and even more relevant to our generation today than Fight Club.	Impeccably scripted, beautifully directed, and filled with fine performances, The Social Network is a riveting, ambitious example of modern filmmaking at its finest.
Seldom has a film so powerfully affected me as Requiem for a Dream has -- affected, in this case, as if my eyes and psyche have been bludgeoned.	A fluent, intelligent piece of work whose sex and violence are anything but gratuitous.	It is not to be missed.	You're going to see real actors in their highest form.	Aronofsky's singularly inventive visual style, combined with one of the year's most chillingly evocative scores by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, dares you not to look away, lest you miss something potentially extraordinary.	Though the movie may be too intense for some to stomach, the wonderful performances and the bleak imagery are hard to forget.
The chemistry between the multi-talented Jim Carrey and the now-feisty Renee Zellweger is palpable.	Funny.	This latest jaunt into 'butt joke central' just left me with a bad taste in my mouth.	Carrey himself provides the biggest flash from a major star since Rudolf Nureyev in Valentino.	Has a few funny bits, but most of the time, it relies upon sight gags and profanity, neither of which are humorous alone.	While Jim Carrey's comedic skills earn some laughs, Me, Myself and Irene sports a tired, unsatisfying plot.
It's fun, it's funny, it looks great and it's got Johnny Depp. What else do you need to know about the movie, anyway?	Both sleepy and hollow.	Even though Sleepy Hollow takes hair-raising liberties with the great Washington Irving story on which it is based, it is nonetheless a ripping good ghost story.	We love Burton for his style, not his range. Sleepy Hollow has style in spades, no matter how often we've seen it before.	The horseman charges on, breathing life (from it's severed esophagus) into this sleepy and hollow production.	Sleepy Hollow entertains with its stunning visuals and creepy atmosphere.
It's an interesting commentary on itself that many seem to have missed, dismissing the movie as overly complex, but it smartly tells you exactly how to enjoy this film: keep moving and don't look back.	Except for Clarke, who walks an ambiguous line between heroism and sinister monomania, only Big Arnie leaves the slightest impression after the credits roll.	For all its weaknesses, "Terminator Genisys" is a "Terminator" movie that feels like a "Terminator" movie, more than did "Terminator 3," not to mention the ghastly "Terminator Salvation."	Schwarzenegger's return to his most iconic role provides much of the appeal of this otherwise purposeless redo.	There comes a time in every franchise when it is best to leave well-enough alone.	Mired in its muddled mythology, Terminator: Genisys is a lurching retread that lacks the thematic depth, conceptual intelligence, or visual thrills that launched this once-mighty franchise.
[A] well-shot, bluntly propulsive thriller...	Naranjo numbs sensation to make his points about the drug war's damage to Mexico, turning Miss Bala into a thriller from the dissociative first person perspective.	It's a film that becomes almost numbing in its tone but it's incredibly well-made and performed.	Gripping and heart-breaking in equal measure, this is an impressively directed and superbly acted thriller that plays like a collaboration between the Dardennes Brothers and Michael Mann.	unyielding in its very real terror	Miss Bala's subject is loaded enough, but the frantic and muscular filmmaking puts this movie in a whole new league.
This is one of the dopiest movies of the year.	The movie's too imaginatively crafted to be boring, and too conceptually insane to be awful.	The experience of watching the film is best described as deadening.	Por favor, evitem que este filme alcance uma boa bilheteria e viabilize um Van Helsing 2. Esta é uma ameaça muito mais assustadora do que dez Dráculas e cem Lobisomens juntos.	Too bad [Stephen Sommers'] complete lack of restraint turned this at-first-promising flick into a jarring and prolonged audio-visual wank fest.	A hollow creature feature that suffers from CGI overload.
Don't book into this Hostel unless you're a horror fan. Or if you do, don't complain ...the premise is as twisted and terrifying as the acts themselves.	Roth is able to change the focus from frolicking raunchiness to extreme chilliness in a way that's quite sobering.	Has the foresight to let us spend an hour or so with the stoners before the chainsaws are cranked up.	Roth proves unable to control the tone of his premise, in the end pandering too much to the male adolescent audience that he at first seems to be satirising.	a horror movie cannot run on shock value alone.	Featuring lots of guts and gore, Hostel is a wildly entertaining corpse-filled journey -- assuming one is entertained by corpses, guts, and gore, that is.
It is a harsh story and the filmmakers do not try to sugarcoat or diminish its power and tragedy.	Anyone who sees Nanking should know going in what a brutal story it is, but no one should miss it because of a restrictive rating.	Sheds light on particular wartime atrocities largely neglected in the collective memory.	A tribute to a handful of racial and cultural foreigners and to the Chinese people, 'Nanking' is inspiring... but it can depress in the extreme.	Documentarians Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman brilliantly combine archive footage from Japan's 1937 massive attack on China's former capital of Nanking with heartbreaking interviews of Chinese survivors, guilty Japanese soldiers, and actors giving stage r	This powerful and horrific documentary brings the atrocities committed at Nanking to light without sugarcoating any of the brutality.
Transsiberian eventually reveals itself to be scatterbrained thematically.	Transsiberian is fantastic.	Transsiberian makes suspenseful and sometimes violent gestures, but it's all decoration.	An engagingly up-to-date melodrama steeped in local color.	A morally complex if plot-wobbly thriller set on the Trans-Siberian Express as it rockets (well, creaks and groans) through snowy forests and forgotten towns.	Traditional in form yet effective in execution, this taut thriller updates the "danger on a train" scenario with atmospheric sense.
Even in a cartoon this technically astounding, most of the characters appear to have sprung from the DNA of Astro Boy.	With all that gorgeous imagery, you'd think the filmmakers would have found a way to tell the story visually without using mountains of expositional dialogue.	Shut your brain down for optimal viewing pleasure.	It's an exceedingly brilliant combination of future shock set-up and old school moralizing, a deconstruction of what it means to be human rendered in tech tones so slick that you often forget you're watching a cartoon.	Has a plot that frolics in the no-man's land between fiendish complexity and utter incomprehensibility.	While visually arresting, Appleseed's narrative and dialogue pondering existentialism is ponderous, awkward, and clumsy.
The movie has no internal logic. It's a mess.	Mr. Bakshi's skill as an animator continues to outshine his judgment about subject matter.	One of my favorite movies that I didn't like.	Hopeless.	Even the eventual universe-shaking shag is an anti-climax, and by the time all hell rips loose just before the abysmally contrived happy ending, you're well past caring.	Cool World throws a small handful of visual sparks, but they aren't enough to distract from the screenplay's thin characters and scattered plot.
Perhaps we have fallen in love with this movie because we distrust our civilization and feel betrayed that we have lost our sense of nature.	In many ways, Kong is still king.	The continuing success of King Kong is due not only to its spectacular special effects, but also to the exemplary economy with which the filmmakers handled the screenplay, filming and editing.	The throbbing heart of the film lies in the creation of the semi-human simian himself, an immortal tribute to the Hollywood dream factory...	One of the best adventure horror films ever made, an icon of pop culture with truly erotic and emotionally touching scenes between Fay Wray and the massive gorrilla	King Kong explores the soul of a monster -- making audiences scream and cry throughout the film -- in large part due to Kong's breakthrough special effects.
Snyder's accomplishment is to drain that of any erotic heat; he generated a lot more with the glistening-with-sweat abs in 300 than he manages here.	I think Zack Snyder just thought of the craziest things he wanted to see in a movie, so he did it. That's what artists should do. Now it turns out to be some metaphorical fantasy and that's cool too.	Perhaps the female slant of the fantasy stew is what pushed me over the genre edge to appreciate this overwrought, yet controlled, CGI madhouse.	Imaginary girl posse empowerment, or male fantasy sexualized violence? Entailing female fighter fashion statement armor comprising stilettos, fishnet, overflowing bosomy bustiers and big hair.	Yeah, it feels like a video game. Unfortunately, the video game it feels like is Pong.	It's technically impressive and loaded with eye-catching images, but without characters or a plot to support them, all of Sucker Punch's visual thrills are for naught.
... a terrific choice for the whole family, ... [but compared to all of the previous Pixar films, it's] a bit of a disappointment.	It's really great moviemaking, even when the script grows overly familiar, which, finally, it does.	Monsters displays wonderful imagination which makes it worth reliving in an extra dimension - particularly the energetic chase scene along a conveyor belt of doors.	Monsters Inc. reminds us that studios desperately need to put the same amount of effort into live-action features that they do their animated counterparts.	The excellent basic ideas have yielded too few twists and dramatic junctures to keep the picture flying at the level at which it starts.	Clever, funny, and delightful to look at, Monsters, Inc. delivers another resounding example of how Pixar elevated the bar for modern all-ages animation.
The film tries to position itself as a comic anthem for unshackled single-womanhood, but it's aimed at the bland middle.	An extremely entertaining movie.	One of the most genuinely funny romances for some time.	It's so aggressive you don't even have to like it; the movie likes itself well enough for the both of you.	...a thoroughly enjoyable piece of work that everyone (yes, everyone) will admire.	Though there was controversy over the choice of casting, Zellweger's Bridget Jones is a sympathetic, likable, funny character, giving this romantic comedy a lot of charm.
Mackenzie's 8th feature demonstrates the vivid, idiosyncratic storytelling fluency... of his most recent movies... Each element, each moment is just one component of a breathtakingly accomplished canvas. Cruelty is unceasing; Mackenzie refuses to blink.	[An] unusually cohesive and exciting prison drama ...	Despite its inevitable hard-surface jailhouse cliches, Starred Up is impressively well filmed, impeccably acted and, for those of a nervous disposition, brutally shocking.	Yup, there's a prison wing full of clichés, but, aided by razor-sharp performances from his cast, Young Adam director, David Mackenzie, delivers a raw, powerful, British prison drama.	It's almost as difficult to sit through "Starred Up" as it is satisfying to watch it.	Smart, hard-hitting, and queasily realistic, Starred Up is an instant classic of U.K. prison cinema.
Smarter, leaner, funnier, and more human than most entries in the genre, relying less on spectacle than on the chemistry of the two leads and the wit of the script for its appeal.	A solid, entertaining, intelligent, and funny entry into the annals of this summer's moviegoing selection.	This movie is a lot of fun, except that it has a little too much slime.	From here, the next step is easy: extraterrestrials are living among us.	"Men in Black" still holds up after 15 years. It's as fun, funky, and edgy now as it was in 1997, and HD breathes even more life into it.	Thanks to a smart script, spectacular set pieces, and charismatic performances from its leads, Men in Black is an entirely satisfying summer blockbuster hit.
[A] gross-out classic.	Quite possibly the most gruesome film I've ever seen, this live-action manga thriller at least has a vicious sense of humour amid the gore.	Much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever.	I think there is a line between ... exploring sadism and practicing it, and Miike takes a Carl Lewis long jump over that line and doesn't look back.	Those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to Ichi.	Ichi The Killer is a thoroughly shocking gorefest that will surely entertain those with strong stomachs and a penchant for brutal violence.
Despite its defects, however, the picture manages to be charming.	Just nuthin' special	Pure Mindless Entertainment Value!	There is a limit to the entertainment value of the deliberately bad, but Godzilla 2000 stays just on the right side of it.	Despite special effects far inferior to those used in the 1998 American version, [Toho Studio] is still the master of its original 1954 creation.	Godzilla 2000 is cheesy, laughable, and good entertaining fun.
Be prepared, however, for a large beaker of the milk of human kindness.	The third version of the classic is better than the second (in 1948) and almost as touching as Cukor's first rendition in 1933, toplining Kathatrine Hepburn.	While adherents of the original will carp at some anachronistic themes, few will quibble about the quality of the performances.	It's the performances ... that make this movie special.	Director Gillian Armstrong's feminist spin on classic material retains the moving humanity of Louisa May Alcott's novel while reworking it with welcome freshness.	Thanks to a powerhouse lineup of talented actresses, Gillian Armstrong's take on Louisa May Alcott's Little Women proves that a timeless story can succeed no matter how many times it's told.
The Beat That My Heart Skipped may be rooted in Toback's 1978 film but Audiard makes it a modern parable that befits the new millennium.	Duris' jittery, defensive performance keeps the suggestion of violence close to the surface.	If Audiard's film is less relentless and, ultimately, more hopeful than Toback's [Fingers], it is no less compelling a study of the attempt to harmonize seemingly dissonant forces -- tenderness and brutality, classicism and modernity, France and Vietnam.	Easy to overlook, and will probably be easy to forget	Plays like a piece of mediocre music, gorgeously rendered.	Stylish and visceral, this able remake is infused with realism, grit, and a taut performance by star Romain Duris.
House of Sand boasts the hypnotic power of its landscape and a pair of powerful and passionate performances by Montenegro and Torres.	The dramatic and often sad lives led by the women yield surprisingly intimate dramas considering such limitless surroundings, a contrast that's played up by the excellent cinematography.	Visually dazzling, epic in its sweep and deeply romantic in its sensibility, The House of Sand is one of those films whose images and ideas linger long after the lights come on, having been burned into the viewer's consciousness.	After a long dry spell, House of Sand is an original and exceptional revision of the woman's picture (in the broad sense and without the melodrama that label often implies).	Shimmering with beautiful imagery and heartfelt emotion, House of Sand is a triumph.	Beautifully filmed with wonderful performances, this Brazilian tale deftly explores the passage of time and prolonged isolation in several decades of a mother and daughter relationship.
A mashup of 'Some Like It Hot' (leering rooster-in-the-henhouse voyeurism) and 'Glee' (peppy musical interludes), that, on the plus side, grapples with the potent issue of young black male identity...	It only escapes a bomb rating because it's more irritating than offensive -- like an ant crawling across a counter top rather than a roach roosting in the cereal box.	Oh, come on now! Knock it off!	John Whitesell, who helmed BM2, keeps the gender-flipping gags firing with a sense of seriousness that seems blind to the inanity of the granny-panty flimsy plot.	it is likely that this shambles will be the final nail in the coffin of the career of a man once touted as The Next Eddie Murphy.	Unnecessary, unfunny, and generally unwelcome, Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son offers more of the same for fans of Martin Lawrence's perplexingly popular series.
I Am Number Four indeed. Cause this is a movie that just took two gigantic dumps on my brain.	This is a whimper of a film simply trying to capitalize on the success of the Twilight formula and, well, every superhero movie under the sun.	I Am Number Four could just as easily have been called 'Frankenmovie.' It takes bits and pieces from a lot of other films and simply assembles them in a different order.	Is I Am Number Four going to revolutionize Young Adult fantasy filmmaking? Let's not FOURce the issue.	Genre fans are advised to steer clear.	It's positioned as the start of a franchise, but I Am Number Four's familiar plot and unconvincing performances add up to one noisy, derivative, and ultimately forgettable sci-fi thriller.
The dialogue is fresh and on the money.	Manages humor, irreverence and a taste of something sweet while sticking close to its indie roots.	The movie is difficult to describe because it's not what happens that matters, it's how it happens and why.	Vaughn and Favreau possess great comic chemistry and their dynamic makes this movie well worth watching.	What really sets it apart from the rest of the summer fodder is the remarkable chemistry between Vaughn and Favreau.	Not as good as Swingers, but it's still witty and goofy enough for some laughs.
Good for a cheapie fright-night outing (or at least a fun rental later for your next slumber party).	It's a ridiculous, absurd slasher film with a concept that is so bad that it's undoubtedly good and makes for some wicked entertainment.	[Seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels.	Provides the Halloween franchise with a clear, objective Worst Movie Of The Series...a virtually flawless collection of all the things that can make a slasher film unwatchable.	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise, it would have been better off dead.	The only thing this tired slasher flick may resurrect is nostalgia for when the genre was still fresh and scary.
Can Woody Allen do wrong?	Annie Hall is refreshing because it showed an astonishing leap in creativity, exploration, and cinematic curiosity from Allen's previous film.	A funny film, and it's fresh even today, though it's not a knee-slapper. Rather, it's a shrug-your-shoulder-and-grin kind of movie.	It's a very funny film, playing with half-baked intellectual ideas, with Woody at the top of his verbal game.	Funny movie about relationships. Not for kids.	Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, Annie Hall represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic.
A little more reach would have allowed Ten to turn it up to 11.	Makes maximum use of a minimalist structure to deliver some cogent observations about the status of women in contemporary Iran.	Who would have thought a movie centered on a driver and her passengers that never leaves the car could be so compellingly watchable? Ten is not only a fascinating character study, but a portrait of an entire way of life.	If Ten feels neither like a reinvention of cinema nor a truly fundamentalist attempt to get back to basics, it manages to work best as a distinctive entry in Kiarostami's diverse oeuvre.	Lacks the spiritual foundation, the individual search for beauty in the face of the world's indifference, that is the hallmark of Kiarostami's oeuvre.	Ten turns a conversational car ride into a gritty and compelling character study full of real emotion while providing an intriguing look into the lives of women in contemporary Iranian culture.
The filmmakers couldn't decide what to cut out, so they threw everything into the pot and hoped for the best. The results are half interesting, but half filler.	Most of the action is a mere replay of a single sequence: Wolverine and Sabretooth galloping toward one another, two immortal bros locked in eternal combat. Certainly feels like it.	With the exception of an adequate helicopter attack, the action is perfunctory and forgettable, albeit no more so than the script's range of cliches	This feels like a movie put together by studio execs who think that stupid fanboys will eat up any random string of flashy, noisy action scenes.	Reported to be the one thing missing in-part from the leaked workprint, sadly many of the special effects in X-Men Origins: Wolverine are somewhat sub-standard.	Though Hugh Jackman gives his all, he can't help X-Men Origins: Wolverine overcome a cliche-ridden script and familiar narrative.
Just when you start to get caught up in the action, one of the supporting actors shows up, mugging and breaking the tension.	James Bond returns in Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker, disguised as a 14-year-old boy involved in a mission so outrageously top secret that even the producers of the movie deny his true identity.	It's better than some James Bond movies -- no matter what your age.	Geoffrey Sax makes a good fist of the visuals, mustering plenty of bonkers sets, vehicular action and new-fangled gizmos.	Stormbreaker plays with, well, not complete authenticity, but more-than-expected authenticity.	Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker is strictly children's fare, as it lacks originality, excitement, and believabiltity.
one of the most compelling examples of documentary filmmaking ever produced	Director Andrew Jarecki mounts a convincing argument but declines to work up the kind of scalding condemnation of the justice system that his findings would seem to demand.	Surprise after surprise unravels, changing our take on the whole situation.	I can't stop thinking about the Friedmans. I want to, but I can't.	A profoundly disturbing film, but a brilliant one...It portrays the disintegration of an American family in a fashion that would have done Eugene O'Neill proud.	A haunting depiction of a disintegrating family, and a powerful argument on the elusiveness of truth.
Amazing social satire with humor that never detracts from the creep-out factor. The nightmare sequence is sheer perfection.	One of the finest horror films ever made.	Rosemary's Baby is suffused with Polanski's style and preoccupations.	Mia Farrow excels as the pretty young thing who suspects she's carrying the spawn of Satan, but it's Polanski who emerges as the real star.	A supremely intelligent and convincing adaptation of Ira Levin's Satanist thriller.	A frightening tale of Satanism and pregnancy that is even more disturbing than it sounds thanks to convincing and committed performances by Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon.
A climatic rebirth-by-chainsaw scene almost makes it all worthwhile, though you may have had to visit the bathroom once or twice in the wait.	Divertido em seu humor descompromissado, este trash faz rir, mas năo oferece o menor indício do virtuoso cineasta que Jackson se tornaria.	An Ok start for a good director	Jackson does it all in this movie: writes, directs, stars, produces, and designs the makeup.	Paucity of budget, however, cannot hide boundless creativity, true filmmaking style or gobs and gobs of in-your-face homemade gore and grue.	Peter Jackson's early low-budget shocker boasts a disgusting premise - aliens harvesting humans for fast food - that gives the budding auteur plenty of room for gross-out visuals and absurd cleverness.
Parental Content Review	It's a bouncy, engaging, slightly revealing and at times downright moving portrait of Jackson, sweating to his own oldies at 50, prepping a "comeback" he never got to make.	A deeply creepy and disturbing exercise, in which we're exposed to footage that was likely never meant to see the light of day, featuring a performer who at the time was, literally, days away from death.	Jackson's mystery deepens, even as it dissolves between our fingers.	As much as This Is It recalls Jackson's genius, it perpetuates the exploitation that shaped his life.	While it may not be the definitive concert film (or the insightful backstage look) some will hope for, Michael Jackson's This Is It packs more than enough entertainment value to live up to its ambitious title.
At only 77 minutes, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo is about 76 minutes too long.	Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo is the cinematic equivalent of a bunch of 13-year-old boys in a locker room, repeating dirty phrases they've just learned.	Precisely, unfailingly what you would expect.	With this latest exercise in cynicism, however, it's not Deuce's satisfied clientele, but the audience, that gets the shaft.	Why are you reading this review? Seriously, do you think this is the movie where Rob Schneider shows the world he's the next Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson?	A witless follow-up to the surprise 1999 hit, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo is raunchy, politically incorrect, and not particularly funny.
Boyle gives us an unrelenting film, with pitch-perfect pacing and tension, never overstaying the story's welcome. Franco's portrayal is magnificent, reflecting more colors than a Utah sky at sunset.	With all due respect to Franco's strong performance, the director, Danny Boyle hijacked the story for a chance to show off his visual style.	The story of a man stuck under a rock somehow becomes a whirring, frantic flight of cinematic bluster - enjoyable, even exhilarating at times, but frustratingly at odds with how one imagines the actual experience must have been.	A movie about so much more than just a bloody punchline. Director Danny Boyle knows this and has accordingly made what may be his best film, to date.	As Aron, Franco brings tremendous charm and depth to a virtual solo performance piece.	As gut-wrenching as it is inspirational, 127 Hours unites one of Danny Boyle's most beautifully exuberant directorial efforts with a terrific performance from James Franco.
Jets along on a rocket-fuel cocktail of blood-pumping adrenaline, powerful secrets, searing heartache and rousing uplift.	The movie brushes against some of India's worst social ills, but it's essentially a fairy tale.	Slumdog Millionaire bursts with life, delighting, shocking and constantly engaging through lively visuals and the rags-to-maybe-riches adventures of a young man who travels from the slums to the hot seat of the Indian Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.	Director Danny Boyle has made a cross-cultural milestone that plays with the edgy enrgy of "Trainspotting," albeit with considerable influence from its vibrant Mumbai (formerly Bombay) locations and talented cast.	You know those films that suck you in? The ones where you cower when the hero is in danger and cheer when they come up trumps? Slumdog Millionaire is one of those movies.	Visually dazzling and emotionally resonant, Slumdog Millionaire is a film that's both entertaining and powerful.
...his basic premise of fear fired by menace is so thin and so utterly unconvincing that the story just does not stand.	worthy vehicle that displays Hitchcock's narrative ability and explores some of his favorite themes	With typical consummate verve, Hitch unfolds a story filled with twists, turns and dramatic contrasts.	Of all the films Hithcock made, this is one of his absolute masterpieces.	Hitchcock's handling of the suspense is deadly effective and a quality cast breathe life into some delicious dialogue.	A provocative premise and inventive set design lights the way for Hitchcock diabolically entertaining masterpiece.
A remarkably humorless movie, and not even the adroitly hammy Bill Nighy, as the vampire king, can leaven the overwrought seriousness of it all.	Definitely a highly-stylized, Gothic, ass-kick fest first and foremost.	Echoes the muscular feel of Aliens, the relentless speed of The Terminator and the architectural colorlessness and operatic anxiety of Dark City.	Beckinsale's as much vamp as vampire, and that she's clad in tight shiny leather doesn't at all hurt her contribution to the cachet of the action drama.	None of these scenes will be clear in your mind in two hours.	Though stylish to look at, Underworld is tedious and derivative.
This half-baked fairy tale always seems to be on the verge of becoming charming but despite a good cast it never quite succeeds.	This out-of-nowhere wonder charms from the first frame to the last, and joins Charlie Bartlett on the list of early-2008 films that are both wholesome and intelligent.	Thanks to director Mark Palansky's understated direction -- the fantastical trappings never overwhelm the characters -- and especially with the performances of Ricci and McAvoy, it emerges a charming diversion.	Penelope manages to be entertaining while at the same time pounding you over the head with its "I'm okay with myself" hammer.	Palansky takes a sweet short fable, makes 90 minutes seem like 900, and then gets the moral wrong.	Though Penelope has a charming cast and an appealing message, it ultimately suffers from faulty narrative and sloppy direction.
It's Zombieland's delightfully offbeat characters that give the movie its staying power.	Zombie films provide many opportunities for comic juxtaposition of dire circumstances with trivial detail and the deconstruction of our assumptions.	It has a lot more in common with Little Miss Sunshine than just Abigail Breslin.	Spends most of its time clicking... thanks to a particularly game cast that understands exactly what they're doing in a film like this.	While zombie comedies have been done, ahem, to death after the success of Shaun Of The Dead, this time the laughs - and blood - flow thick and fast.	Wickedly funny and featuring plenty of gore, Zombieland is proof that the zombie subgenre is far from dead.
I seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer.	Like an overdue reunion with an old friend... it's a trilogy that's grown up without losing its soul.	The 3D animation is quite beautiful, and there's the usual bonus of a Pixar short film before the feature, the clever and enchanting Night and Day.	The story mixes comedy, drama and action with impressive skill, except this is beyond skill -- this is inspired.	Managing to create real moments of suspense, a hugely powerful emotional sequence towards the end is testament to the relationships we've built up with this bunch of toys.	Deftly blending comedy, adventure, and honest emotion, Toy Story 3 is a rare second sequel that really works.
Yes, Virginia, there is a reason to see Will Ferrell's new film. At least so long as you've got a preteen in tow.	Director Jon Favreau keeps the film sincere and adult for most of the running time.	Feels like that rare instant Christmas classic.	Audiences must have been VERY nice this year!	You'll laugh hard, you'll laugh often, and you'll leave wishing you still believed in Santa.	A movie full of Yuletide cheer, Elf is a spirited, good-natured family comedy, and it benefits greatly from Will Ferrell's funny and charming performance as one of Santa's biggest helpers.
When a performer as sharp as Cedric the Entertainer is reduced to funny fat-guy shtick, you know you're in the presence of grinding mediocrity.	There are some decent laughs, but the overall package is not good enough to recommend a trip to the theatre.	If not for a few interludes of lively riffing by John Leguizamo, playing a dog trainer and all-around hustler named Dodge, there would be nothing funny about any of this.	[S]o self-consciously strain[s] for yucks that it abandons all semblance of storytelling logic so that it can get to a brutally unfunny joke...	...don't expect any spousal abuse in the mushy, pedestrian and totally unnecessary big-screen version of The Honeymooners.	This pointless remake of the classic TV series only offers generic characters and gags.
Would that Emmerich took as much care with his human characters as with inanimate objects and CGI animals.	10,000 B.C. takes a prehistoric approach to storytelling.	One can only infer that, in order for it to be taken seriously, the makers expected audiences to forget pretty much every movie they'd ever seen before in their entire life.	A tedious bore in which grubby people stand around muttering in a variety of badly chosen accents.	Visually, historically and creatively, this film dishonors the year 10,000 B.C.	With attention strictly paid to style instead of substance, or historical accuracy, 10,000 B.C. is a visually impressive but narratively flimsy epic.
Fall in love with these brave and beautiful birds.	What might have been a static portrait has become a true story, with tragic turns, joyful surprises and provocative glimpses into the meaning of life.	In watching the birds and the man with an affectionate, curious eye, the filmmaker builds a story of surprising emotional resonance.	Bittner is calm, intelligent, confiding, wise and well-spoken.	Appealing as both nature docu and character study.	Interesting and appealing as both a study of man and nature.
The film's shocking grotesqueness is not just for show. It is one element in a multi-layered cultural commentary.	Guillermo del Toro's feature debut is an arch twist on the vampire tale.	A low-budget horror/fantasy with some rough edges, Cronos reveals the dark genius of Guillermo del Toro's fecund mind.	Del Toro's first mini-masterpiece.	Guillermo del Toro says, "Cronos is an exploded view of my brain."	Guillermo del Toro's unique feature debut is not only gory and stylish, but also charming and intelligent.
Ozdemir and Toprak, the director's cousin, shared the Best Actor Award at Cannes, and are equally superb.	Ceylan, who also served as cinematographer, frames the affecting, unstudied performances in gorgeously chosen shots and nonevents that sometimes teeter on the edge of comedy before knocking us breathless with their emotional power.	Distant is a thematically rich Turkish film about urban loneliness, the shame of unemployment and the difficulty of practicing hospitality.	This precisely paced, sensitively performed drama speaks volumes about the growing distance that modern urban living is putting between people who would otherwise have so much in common.	The tale has a deceptive, emotional complexity that builds to a surprisingly heartrending impact.	Hauntingly beautiful, Distant communicates volumes with its almost pervasive silence.
If Rise of the Machines never feels as essential as the first two movies, it doesn't feel like a rip-off, either.	... a worthy sequel.	Mechanical and soulless, it's proof that the machines have already risen -- and won.	The sequel expands on the nature of fate that the previous pictures explored so well, culminating in a rather bold third act where saving the day takes on a more unconventional meaning.	This film feels closer to the medium-tech appeal of Cameron and Hurd's original 1984 Terminator, albeit at approximately 30 times its budget, than to the baroque excesses of T2.	Although T3 never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.
...a passable effort that receives plenty of mileage out of Damon's expectedly engaging performance...	The slickest, coolest assassin flick since "The Professional."	While it never reaches transcendence of its genre, it happens to be pleasurably overstuffed with smart and welcome touches.	I suspect I'll watch this movie over and over. It's simply a blast.	Who needs an identity when you're having this much fun?	Expertly blending genre formula with bursts of unexpected wit, The Bourne Identity is an action thriller that delivers -- and then some.
There's still not much of a script.	Your kids may beg and plead with you to take them to Garfield 2, but when they become teenagers you'll get the blame for acquiescing.	Though the script includes some ostensibly clever references to literature (for plot, Twain, for title only, Dickens), the majority of the film consists of dopey jokes about Garfield's insatiable appetites, selfishness, and laziness.	Garfield himself (voiced by Bill Murray) is once again strikingly unlikable, a bloated, bingeing fascist.	Painful. Our kids deserve better.	Strictly for (very) little kids, A Tale of Two Kitties features skilled voice actors but a plot that holds little interest.
Stealing freely from Save the Last Dance but unintentionally nixing the wicked dance moves, this teen turd doesn't even have the logical sense to remove its hunky lead's shirt.	For the movie--and audiences--the good news is that both Tatum and Dewan are just enough to best the bum script. They are likeable and their dance talent is undeniable.	Displays atypical laziness and tone-deaf direction for a feature concerning the electric boogaloo secrets of the underprivileged.	Tatum and Dewan have none of the chemistry of Astaire and Rogers, but with help from a good supporting cast and talented choreography, the movie rises slightly above the usual cookie-cutter dance-movie fare.	Even if the picture breaks no new ground, the verve of the actors and their fancy footwork is half the battle.	This trite teen romance has too little plot and not enough dancing.
Gosling is given the barest blueprint of a life gone terribly wrong and the actor struggles to make something out of nothing, though he does manage to give the older David an aura of weirdness that is downright creepy.	Jarecki never settles on what kind of story he wants to tell with these elements, and despite good performances, "All Good Things" veers awkwardly from love story to tragedy, from true-life mystery to black comedy.	Things doesn't nail that riveting tone, or any tone for that matter. It grazes along a field of clichés and anemic confrontations, leaving David a bizarrely unchallenged enigma of a man.	It's a strange, thrilling tale begrimed by bad memories, by bad deeds.	...little more than 100 minutes of this-then-that storytelling that offers up a possible (even believable) explanation for its unsolved murder-mystery, but leaves the audience wholly unsatisfied with and unmoved by its conclusions.	It's well-acted, and the true story that inspired it offers plenty of drama -- which is why it's so frustrating that All Good Things is so clichéd and frustratingly ambiguous.
Sadly, in spite of its cast and seemingly can't-miss premise, Wedding Crashers is at its best a succession of mild chuckles.	Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an inspired comedy double act; hopefully they'll do more movies as a team after this.	Wedding Crashers is a comedy that is unabashedly for adults, bless its bawdy, sentimental heart.	This buddy comedy is contrived and formulaic but its off-color raunchiness is also fun.	The frontrunner for this summer's funniest flick, Wedding Crashers is American Pie for grownups.	Wedding Crashers is both raunchy and sweet, and features top-notch comic performances from Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe fares much better in its smaller, quieter moments that test the mettle and morality of its young heroes	Shooting in New Zealand is only one way in which this film mimics THE LORD OF THE RINGS. But somehow one never really cares much for the four children who generally just do the obvious.	The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, by summoning C.S. Lewis' spirit, creates a different kind of spectacle -- a starry-eyed crusade.	El mundo creado por el autor, es recreado aquí de forma soberbia y majestuosa.	If The Lord of the Rings is a shot of whiskey, then The Chronicles of Narnia is a glass of milk.	With first-rate special effects and compelling storytelling, this adaptation stays faithful to its source material and will please moviegoers of all ages.
To sum up, all the deeply ruminative dialogue you need here is: 'Box-office smash!' Still, thanks especially to Norton, this Hulk is credible.	Norton makes for a wiry, curious Bruce Banner. But you can tell from the film's tedium-inducing smackdowns that a different philosophy prevailed: the artificial Zen of video-game playing.	I like him when he's angry ... or is it hungry? Norton is no good-time Downey, but this Hulk smashes the 2003 film. However, I caution the filmmakers and Marvel to be fair to their characters and ...	The movie is about as good as a dumb action flick with a pathetically computer-rendered monster could be.	What a surprise after all the 'Spiderman' films, a comic book film with a good story, well acted and brilliantly directed, buttressed by some clever cameos.	The Incredible Hulk provides the action and excitement to please comic book fans and re-ignite this fledgling franchise.
Flightplan - - a heart-stopping thriller.	Here's the plan the writers came up with to handle the obstacles between their story and plausibility: Ignore them.	The movie loses some of its initial atmospheric tension as paranoid thrills give way to Rambo high jinks.	Flightplan should have remained grounded for repairs.	fantastic job setting up a very eerie, frightening and confusing story ... but the ending falls short of our greatest hopes	The actors are all on key here, but as the movie progress, tension deflates as the far-fetched plot kicks in.
Film has superior technical narrative, impressive lensing and thesping.	Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of hopeful humanity, The Seventh Seal is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning(lessness) of this mortal coil.	Starkly existential, boldly poetic, slow and grim has haunted film aficionados, baffled and bored college students, inspired innumerable parodists, and challenged both believers and unbelievers for nearly half a century.	Easily, one of the greatest films ever made.	It manages some powerful images, but it feels a bit too calculated to really get under the skin.	Narratively bold and visually striking, The Seventh Seal brought Ingmar Bergman to the world stage -- and remains every bit as compelling today.
Represents one of the best and brightest comedies ever to shine from the silver screen.	Not only damn near one of the funniest movies ever made but certainly one of the most quotable.	Monty Python and the Holy Grail still stands as a gloriously silly and twisted send-up.	...embrace the low budget film and its even lower humor.	Holy Grail suffers from the same syndrome that afflicts many of these restored classics: It is better remembered than actually seen.	A cult classic as gut-bustingly hilarious as it is blithely ridiculous, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has lost none of its exceedingly silly charm.
This is almost like a lost movie from my teenhood, a forgotten relic of the late 70s, early 80s, when even summer comedies came with a touch of social commentary and a bit of class consciousness -- when they ate the rich instead of aspiring to be one of t	Sporadically entertaining but relentlessly lightweight...	Grown ups who can't get the joke may simply be jealous they can't go back and do it all over again themselves.	Low of brow and pure of heart, the movie plays like Animal House extra-lite, and as such it's decent indecent fun.	Accepted is trying to be a new species of Animal House, but at least that 1978 comedy had no pretensions of being more than a boisterous spoof of college life.	Like its characters who aren't able to meet their potential, Accepted's inconsistent and ridiculous plot gets annoying, despite a few laughs.
The quirks and eccentric touches of the writing wind up being self-indulgent and just plain annoying on the screen, leading to a seat-squirming experience of mythic proportions.	... grounded by honest, expressive performances from Howard and Winger, who achieve a tempestuous chemistry. It also makes you want to pop open a cold one.	A movie that can't get sufficient distance from Leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence.	There are labors of love and there are labors of labor, exhaustively worked-through movies in which you feel as if you are watching a director give birth to every idea that has been gestating in the brain since he was given his first 8-mm camera.	[Howard] so good as Leon Barlow ... that he hardly seems to be acting.	A boozy depiction of a struggling writer, Big Bad Love is too messy and self-indulgent.
[P]lays like a made-for-TV weeper with an A-list cast.	Sean Penn delivers a powerhouse performance as Sam Dawson.	Each heart-tuggingly placed Beatles tune and life-affirming moment of triumph pats us on the back just for sitting through such a socially responsible film.	I Am Sam is a very special film. It is one of those extraordinarily moving films that not only sweeps you away emotionally, but somehow leave you feeling as though you are a better person.	About as connected to the real world as Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham, from which its title is derived -- in fact, in the realism department, Seuss may have the edge.	Not only does the manipulative I Am Sam oversimplify a complex issue, it drowns it in treacle.
A great big slab of middlebrow fan-fiction.	Michelle Williams wisely avoids caricature but Monroe's magic can't be replicated. The movie-making scenes are charming but this "true" story is suspect and clumsy off the set.	Michelle Williams is astonishingly good as Marilyn Monroe in My Week With Marilyn. It's a great shame the film itself can't equal the brilliance of Williams' performance.	No, Michelle Williams is not Marilyn Monroe. But what she does in this movie is fascinating and worthy of consideration.	This is one of the most enchanting movies about Monroe and the old days of Hollywood ever made.	Michelle Williams shines in My Week with Marilyn, capturing the magnetism and vulnerability of Marilyn Monroe.
Hilarious comedy classic; language makes it PG-13.	If there was one quintessential director in the 80s, it was John Hughes, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off might be his best film.	Drenched in Eighties-style teen spirit.	In this film [Hughes] has created a character who is every teen-ager's fantasy, but in the process he has lost some of the authenticity of his other films.	Sporadically hilarious, with roots that run far deeper than expected.	Matthew Broderick charms in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a light and irrepressibly fun movie about being young and having fun.
While the film is not quite in the same league as Eastwood's finest works of the past decade, it is still to be admired for telling quite a complex tale in such a clear and compelling manner.	Risks dullness and embraces preachiness to pursue an idea that is given lip service by politicians but is rarely addressed in motion pictures: 'How do we inspire ourselves to greatness?'	The movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, has its corny moments, for sure, but it's also powerful, full of conviction and one of the most inspiring movies of the year.	As always, Eastwood brings solid craftsmanship to the proceedings, with direction that allows the actors to breathe while remaining alert to small details that speak of greater wisdom.	It's possibly Damon's most impressive major role to date.	Delivered with typically stately precision from director Clint Eastwood, Invictus may not be rousing enough for some viewers, but Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman inhabit their real-life characters with admirable conviction.
While the film might be biographically accurate, it isn't artistically satisfying: real people are inexplicable in a way that characters in films shouldn't be, and consequently, he feels half-finished.	Even during this biopic's most absurd moments, Gerard Butler is terrific, conveying gentle and brutal equally well.	It's gratifying to see Butler giving a proper acting role the old college try.	Material that might have made a terrific documentary instead becomes a worthy drama.	The result is a message is too mixed to be effective.	There's a complex man at the center of Machine Gun Preacher but the movie is too shapeless and emotionally vacant to bring his story to life.
terrific performances make it a must-see	Fine Judi Dench starring drama.	Even as the film teases us with the underlying ''sensuality'' of the relationship, it fails to portray it as a convincing human bond. Mrs. Brown is stately yet depressed, like Victoria.	The political nuances of Mrs. Brown may be obscure to most Americans, but you need no expertise in British history to appreciate Ms. Dench's honesty or Mr. Connolly's ferocity,or Anthony Sher's sly turn as the sharp-witted Disraeli.	This discreet drama failed to get to me emotionally.	Thanks to some top notch acting, the chemistry between its stars, and a witty, thoughtful script, Mrs. Brown delivers a nuanced and entertaining, if not entirely factual, account of a seldom explored historical relationship.
Spielberg shows that he remains the master of the form he virtually invented.	What - what - have they created here? Really folks, I'm at a loss...	Spielberg has not only touched the nerve of the American psyche, he has ripped it out, stomped on it and beat it with a club for a full two hours. This is the doomsday hour	I liked it a lot, aside from the ending, which made me want to burn down the theater.	Fantastic and banal, terrifying and occasionally dull, pure Spielberg and yet at times anonymous, War of the Worlds delivers multiple viewing experiences during its two-hour running time.	Steven Spielberg's adaptation of War of the Worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells' classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences.
Instead of enjoying the ride, you wind up counting how many more dreary sequences you have to get through before the movie finally reaches its foreordained conclusion.	Rumor has it that the original title for this romantic comedy was When Harry and Sally Joined the Mile High Club.	I don't know how comfortable I am proclaiming this, but 2005 could be the year known for the rehabilitation of Ashton Kutcher.	Although not as scathingly funny as the Ryan-Crystal classic, director Nigel Cole offers an engaging romance infused with the warmth and optimism of his previous films Calendar Girls and Saving Grace.	Carries a certain charm that should play well to the under thirty-set that it seems to be aiming for with its 90s nostalgia.	A tiresome rom-com.
A bewildering slice of southern gothic hokum, it suffers from a weak script, proving that old saw about actors being only as good as the lines they're given.	A slow procession of degradation and suffering, Hounddog is like a tall glass of bitter iced tea.	A tasteful cautionary fable and fairy tale for adults.	Rarely has there been a movie as misguided as Hounddog, which self-righteously indulges in exploitation while loudly decrying it.	Suggests a Black Snake Moan origin story as conceived by Blanche Devereaux.	Despite a noble effort from Dakota Fanning, Hounddog is overwrought, cliche-ridden and downright exploitative.
If this film is an indicator of the quality of films in 2012 I'll be praying that the Mayans were right about this little blue planet going boom.	Such a great cast. Such a bland concoction.	The entire story is largely nonsensical and Holmes foresees all kinds of events he couldn't possibly foresee in real life, but it is all in good fun. There is plenty of comedy to go along with the drama and action.	The truth about this Game of Shadows and its predecessor is that neither has a story worthy of its hero. The story is not only often improbable, it is often simply impossible to follow.	The novelty of Ritchie's direction has diminished, but Downey's charm hasn't.	Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a good yarn thanks to its well-matched leading men but overall stumbles duplicating the well-oiled thrills of the original.
Supercop is a better movie than Rumble in the Bronx, in large part because it's funnier.	Supercop is at its most banal when it apes the Western action style and at its best when Jackie is interacting with the scenery and props around him.	A super-charged, bang-up action flick the likes of which most Americans still have never seen.	Chan is joined in this outing by a female co-star, Michelle Khan, who seems every bit his equal when it comes to martial-arts prowess and foolhardy daredeviltry. Taken together, they're like watching two 007's, one 0014 or, as they say now, whatever.	Supercop's biggest flaw is what its producers probably saw as its greatest strength: it's very American.	Blending hand-to-hand combat with breathtaking stunts and slapstick comedy, Supercop reminds us why Jackie Chan is one of the world's great entertainers.
For those looking for a Superman tale well-told, or signs that the DC Comics universe may finally be ready to give Marvel a run for its money in the multiplexes -- there's nothing to see here.	The film doesn't lack for spectacle, but after a while its emphasis on grand gestures and unwavering gravitas stops feeling heroic and begins to seem like overkill.	Forget all of the Supermen of the past. Like it or not, purists, Man of Steel is the kind of theatrical reboot Superman has needed for a while.	Spectacular but empty. Looking for Nolan's trademark solemnity? It's there. How about a dour, pensive hero? Yup, got that too. What it doesn't have is much character or soul.	Cavill makes a super Superman but the film drags a little and could use some humor.	Man of Steel provides exhilarating action and spectacle to overcome its detours into generic blockbuster territory.
I should have been spending time considering why the defector would lie and why Salt would run, but I couldn't get past wondering why there are so many ponderous flashbacks.	Salt is like a swell summer day at the movies back in 1984, when flicks knew how to do action and dudes named Vladimir had trouble boarding a Delta flight from New York to Washington.	This is a movie with a massive Cold War hangover.	Despite the dubious ending, it's truly a thrilling joyride and worth your time.	There was enough people getting kicked in the face and punched in various places for me to feel like it was not a complete and total waste of my time.	Angelina Jolie gives it her all in the title role, and her seasoned performance is almost enough to save Salt from its predictable and ludicrous plot.
Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.	Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.	Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.	The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.	'Triad Election' creates vignettes without depth by piling set pieces hard and fast upon set pieces -- none of them offering anything new.	Taking its cues from the Godfather series, Triad Election understands how a giddy mix of thrills and gunplay can make for compelling cinema.
A persuasive, comedic argument against the existence of God or a blasphemous reinvention of Jesus as a shameless con artist? You be the judge.	Ricky Gervais is a brave and creative talent and this subversive, ultimately romantic film about the value of white lies certainly has its moments.	It feels, in spirit, like a fable, in the mold of films like It's a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street. I just wish it were better.	His comedy pretends to be unthreatening, a harmless little wheeze, and then pushes the envelope to its logical conclusion.	I think the first half hour would be almost impossible to sustain because it is so inspired.	It doesn't quite follow through on its promise, and relies too heavily on shopworn romantic comedy tropes, but The Invention of Lying is uncommonly sly and funny.
A masterpiece dealing with woman's liberation	A righteously angry movie, [but] also a joyous movie, because Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene ... fills every moment with song and color and life.	Sembene nails down an entire society in a series of immortally ordinary moments worthy of Satyajit Ray, with the regular-guy (or gal!) heroism of Howard Hawks.	The eightysomething Sembene delivers a powerfully acted and colourfully shot polemic. A perceptive observation of daily life in an African village that celebrates female bravery and solidarity.	Opens a window to a culture we rarely see, creating both a small story of a mother and daughter and a vast story of female empowerment.	A vibrant, powerful, and poignant glimpse into the struggles of women in modern Africa.
Nathaniel attempts to define his family (his father had two children out of wedlock and one while married) while capturing the simple brilliance of his pop's designs, which cinematographer Robert Richman captures gloriously.	Not only repeats the now-familiar approach, but does so in a transparent, uninspiring manner.	Louis Kahn's life is certainly out of the ordinary, but My Architect is a fumbling, poorly made work that doesn't do him justice.	Compelling, luminous, and poignant.	In searching for Louis Kahn through his art, Nathaniel Kahn created a work of art of his own.	A moving and enlightening documentary about architect Louis Kahn.
One of the scariest, goriest, and (oddly enough) funniest horror movies of its time, and it's every bit deserving of being called a cult classic.	...all of the flubs, the bad edits, and the cheesy matte shots are key elements of a low-budget aesthetic that enhances the movie's impact even as it makes excuses for itself.	In the league of "Night of the Living Dead" and "Jaws" where it continues to be immortal and outlive other horror classics in the face of changing movie going sentiment...	A testament to how bliss and the spark of inspiration can elevate a film of any budget in any genre from routine to sublime.	Think "The Blair Witch Project," but with the witch holding the camera.	This classic low budget horror film combines just the right amount of gore and black humor, giving The Evil Dead an equal amount of thrills and laughs.
A technically proficient but disturbing adaptation (that) adopts a surprisingly macabre tone.	It's a heartwarmer that doesn't have much of a heart itself.	The utter freedom of camera movement evokes a visceral sense of buoyant jubilation that immediately connects us to the movie's setting.	The story is robust enough to survive the theme-park treatment, and for the most part it's a very good ride, with a welcome note of actual Christmas caroling spirit.	Watching the humans in this live action/animation combo is like watching 'Zombies On Parade'	Robert Zemeckis' 3-D animated take on the Dickens classic tries hard, but its dazzling special effects distract from an array of fine performances from Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman.
Pure weirdo fun.	Deadpan humor, throwaway visual jokes, and oblique political and social satire may have doomed this way-cool flick to the neverland of sci-fi cultdom.	A 1984 underground touchstone [that's] a creepy visitation from a fracturing society.	It's very entertaining, and though it's rude in an R-rated way, it has the good taste never to promise more than it can deliver.	It's a one of a kind anomaly with Emilio Estevez at his best.	Repo Man is many things: an alien-invasion film, a punk-rock musical, a send-up of consumerism. One thing it isn't is boring.
The film's stark approach to the fantastic and supernatural won't appeal to the mainstream, despite a distinctive and visually arresting presentation.	A moving, gently reassuring tale that softens the boundaries between humanity and nature, life and the afterlife.	"A film that will linger in your thoughts and dreams for a long time after waking from its intoxicating slumber."	The movie isn't paced as a conventional narrative; its story imperceptibly droops, like a heavy frond.	Uncle Boonmee should count himself lucky if none of his future lives include having to watch this movie. Watching it seemed to last several lifetimes.	Languorous and deeply enigmatic, Palme d'Or winner Uncle Boonmee represents an original take on the ghosts that haunt us.
Compelling drama.	A subtly powerful drama that finally tells us that not only is death not the end, sometimes it makes for new beginnings.	The performers are so spot on, it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles.	A ho-hum male weepie/road comedy.	Bleakly funny, its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves.	With a cast that includes some of the best acting talent in Britain, Last Orders is a rewarding character-driven ensemble piece.
If the narrative is just a touch out of puff by the end, it's worth it for such subtly hilarious scenes along the way. With The Trip it really is the journey that matters, not the destination.	In its best moments, this is a pleasant trifle, but sometimes it's just pleasantly boring.	Reunites the delectable pair of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, real-life actor-comic friends who play versions of themselves to highly amusing and oddly wistful effect.	Line for line, insult for insult, The Trip is the year's most addictively quotable movie.	What works in bite-sized portions, quickly sours as an evening's extended dining.	Amiable, funny and sometimes insightful, The Trip works as both a showcase for the enduring chemistry between stars Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon and an unexpected perusal of men entering mid-life crises.
click to read the full review	The final (really?) film in this lifeless franchise about the inevitability of death, which typically comes in the form of some grisly three-dimensional accident.	Although it lacks ambition and is comically daft, as pure popcorn cinema goes this splatter-fest is delivers exactly what it should: tension, mayhem and an unhealthy body count.	Does anyone in Hollywood know what "final" means? Enough already!	Aside from the addition of 3-D, the newest Final Destination flick has little to offer audiences other than more gleefully depraved scenes of carnage.	With little of the ingenuity of previous installments, The Final Destination is predictable, disposable horror fare.
Whether writer-director Anne Fontaine's film is a ghost story, an account of a nervous breakdown, a trip down memory lane, all three or none of the above, it is as seductive as it is haunting.	Cold, nervy and memorable.	Brings a rare, clinically specific sense of moral complexity and humanistic sympathy to the usual regimen of finger-pointing and exposure.	Penetrating and emotionally complex.	Hushed but scalpel-sharp drama, a movie that'll probably send men in the audience home much quieter than they arrived.	How I Killed My Father is a penetrating character study of father-son ties.
a blood-soaked parody of the American dream	A Swiftian satire on white yuppies -- it's American Psycho with five psychos.	...contrived and mean-spirited.	...hollow, simple-minded and about as profound an experience as stepping in a pile of road kill.	...unpleasant and extremely unfunny...	Mean-spirited and empty.
Too masked, too anonymous.	A nonsensical vanity project for singer Bob Dylan that wastes the talents of a lot of folks who should have known better.	There's a cracked integrity to the picture that eventually won me over.	Void of inflection, Dylan doesn't act, but stands and looks uneasy in whatever space the camera is pointing. The deadness in his eyes stops the movie cold.	After a zippy first hour, the wackos wear out their welcome and the director, perversely, fails to show the big concert.	Unintelligible and self-indulgent Bob Dylan vehicle.
A delightful throwback to a simpler time.	A pale imitation of the original Winnie the Pooh Disney shorts of the '60s.	When it comes to Pooh stories, a shortage of ambition and reluctance to improve on success should be counted as assets.	It's not just the pacing. The Tigger Movie just doesn't show a lot of imagination.	A kid flick the little ones will doubtless adore yet also provide old-timers with enough moments of wit and visual magic.	Tigger Movie may lack the technological flash and underlying adult sophistication of other recent animated movies, but it's fun and charming.
Bill Murray finds a real showcase for his oft-shackled talent in this manic comedy.	Both Dreyfuss and Murray give droll performances, and the film resists the temptation to side with either nut.	With his twisted lower lip, doleful eyes and trademark deadpan, [Murray] exudes an awkward -- and funny -- vulnerability.	Murray, with his curious blend of pathos and aggressiveness, is terrific, and so is an acutely uptight Dreyfuss, never once copping a plea for our sympathy.	Its less is more approach makes for a brilliantly constructed plot in which Murray becomes more and more obnoxious and Dreyfuss is gradually driven to distraction by his eccentric little ways.	Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss' chemistry helps make the most of a familiar yet durable premise, elevating What About Bob? into the upper ranks of '90s comedies.
Chicago 10, Brett Morgen's semi-animated, semi-documentary attempt to make the '60s cool for a new generation of kids, does the opposite.	His political heart is in the right place but Brett Morgen can't connect the '60s anti-war movement to the political counter-culture from which it sprung.	A bit of a mess but it is such an energetic and ambitious mess that it winds up capturing the energy and feel of its subject better than a more staid approach to the material possibly could have achieved.	A vibrant, unconventional documentary about the conspiracy trial of the so-called inciters of the riots that occurred during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.	If presentation of the tumultuous events before, during and after the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago will suffice for a feature-length film, then it's hard to imagine a more ferocious or inventive depiction than Chicago 10.	Brett Morgan's half-animated, half-documentary film is an arresting, sometimes visionary portrait of the historic and chaotic trial.
Anchored by Paul Newman's thoroughly magnetic performance...	...a gulag melodrama, if such a thing is possible.	A masterpiece of justice and the injustice it hides.	...most viewers will have little failure understanding the movie and its motives. They communicate brilliantly.	As this 'Southern' turns up the heat, the sense of sadistic oppression, of being looked down on by 'the man,' swelters and burns. The glowering sun eclipses the convict in its hellfire glow. Newman/Luke's knowing smile, though, burns on.	Though hampered by Stuart Rosenberg's direction, Cool Hand Luke is held aloft by a stellar script and one of Paul Newman's most indelible performances.
This efficient British chiller ticks the right boxes.	The idea of cosseted middle-class tots becoming feral psychopaths has potential, though most of it is squandered by uncertain direction and some unconvincing psychology.	All build and no bang.	Watching The Children is like listening to babies cry. Unsettling and exasperating, you pray for it to stop.	The movie is surprisingly gory and suspenseful: a joyous corrective to the festive cheer.	Unsettling and spine-chilling low-budget British horror, with effective and disturbing scares.
Love Crime deconstructs the genre by showing how to put together a mystery in order to deceive and manipulate those who would try to take it apart.	Alain Corneau once again looks at female friendship between mentor and protege in the workplace, where power struggles become all, but unlike "Fear and Trembling," ..."Love Crime" is a cross between a Chabrolian murder mystery and "All About Eve."	Ludivine Sagnier gives one of her best performances in this seductively nasty "business-world" thriller.	Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Especially one in a power suit, who knows how to work a room.	The two-handed duet at the center of Love Crime radiates, but the parade of easily parodied men who stomp in and out of their corporate offices just seem like script rejects from Mad Men.	Director Corneau's swan song, Love Crime is smart and typically well-directed, but too thin and formulaic to overcome its melodramatic trappings.
Our second encounter with the Class of '99 is unashamedly similar to (but way slicker than) its predecessor.	When it comes to sheer, unadulterated laughs, one couldn't hope for much better...Alyson Hannigan is absolutely charming.	Has the rather desperate feel of a major cash-in.	Fans of the first one will come away tasting soggy reheat, not this year's new improved recipe.	Packed with juvenile gags that would barely pass muster in a fifth-grade boys bathroom.	Being a sequel, American Pie 2 doesn't retain the freshness of the original, nor is it as funny.
If I had to use just one word to describe Nurse Betty, that word would undoubtedly be...Quirky. And I mean that in a really, really good way.	It's Zellweger's movie, and her charm proves to be just the right prescription to balance LaBute's astringent style.	Although everyone involved is likable, especially Zellweger, the elements don't mesh.	Its originality and sheer wacked-out likability compensate for its weaknesses in pacing.	This film probably won't please people who enjoy it when Neil LaBute picks at society's scabs. For those who don't mind their reality undercut with a little bit of fancy and who'd rather have someone kiss it and make it better, Nurse Betty is in.	Quirky in the best sense of the word, Nurse Betty finds director Neil LaBute corralling a talented cast in service of a sharp, imaginative script.
Stupid	Amiable but toothless...	There is not a banana's worth of plot in the Dana Olsen and Audrey Wells script to offer narrative nourishment.	Part screwball romance, part special-effects adventure.	Take only that part of you that is still 11 years old and check your brain at the door.	George of the Jungle is faithful to its source material -- which, unfortunately, makes it a less-than-compelling feature film.
If your idea of a good time is watching a lot of stupid, unpleasant people insult and brutalize one another, this is right up your alley.	...as accessible and satisfying a sequel as one might've hoped...	Though the follow-up is bigger, it's not really better. The surprise is missing.	A sequel worth seeing.	While this sequel may not rise to the heights of the classic first, it is still a damn fine flick with lots to love.	It lacks the fresh thrills of its predecessor, but Die Hard 2 still works as an over-the-top -- and reasonably taut -- big-budget sequel, with plenty of set pieces to paper over the plot deficiencies.
It's great fun. It's like one of those inspirational sports movies where you want to stand up and cheer at the end.	One of the best comedies in years...the film never sells out to itself.	Black's iconic performance here perfectly blends his naturally slovenly persona with his obvious passion for, and knowledge of, rock and roll.	At last, here is a movie that isn't afraid to care about something out loud.	The School of Rock may be the best 'inspirational teacher' movie ever made.	Black's exuberant, gleeful performance turns School of Rock into a hilarious, rocking good time.
Surely they mean Outlandish...ready-made for a late-night slot on the Sci-Fi channel.	Outlander is a cheesy, low-budget, space alien Viking monster movie. And seemingly proud of it.	I am tempted to describe the plot of Outlander as preposterous, but a movie about an alien spaceship crashing into a Viking fjord during the Iron Age is likely to be preposterous.	In its second half, Outlander falls apart completely, becoming nothing but a violent, mindless monster movie along the lines of Alien vs. Predator.	For those eagerly awaiting a consummation of the long-simmering tensions between aliens and Vikings, 'Outlander' is certainly the only game in town. Those whose obsessions lead elsewhere would be wise to look for alternatives.	Schizophrenic in subject and lackluster in execution, Outlander might have trouble finding the cult audience for which it was built.
Rough-hewn and sometimes too garrulous, Joe may not be quite the equal of Green's earlier films. But it's nicely judged and, like Joe's bad dreams, can't be ignored.	Poulter's intensity matches Cage's, note for note. The frightening verisimilitude of his portrayal lends the film a cinema verite realism that nicely mutes some of Cage's star power.	There is a pleasing synchronicity between Joe's attempts to stem his temper and the effort made by Cage to keep his own actorly excesses in check.	Director-writer David Gordon Green's quietly intense character study is a movie that reminds us that Nicolas Cage can still be a great actor when he wants to be.	While Green deftly brings us into this small Texas town, perfectly capturing its inhabitants and their humid surroundings, the script by Gary Hawkins (adapting the novel by Larry Brown) overplays its hand.	Rich in atmosphere and anchored by a powerful performance from Nicolas Cage, Joe is a satisfying return to form for its star -- as well as director David Gordon Green.
Dear Frankie never quite overcomes its narrative flaws, however well intentioned they might be.	In the insightful hands of first-time filmmaker Shona Auerbach and veteran actors who play their roles with intelligence, the movie deftly ducks the schmaltz.	Sometimes no amount of good acting can make a film hold your interest.	Emotional responses are in keeping with the characterizations, and well-written dialogue... helps sustain a reality that the turns of plot constantly threaten.	A wrenchingly sweet and beautifully acted film that keeps surprising us -- it never takes us where we think it's going, but always where we want to go.	Dear Frankie is a small, good-hearted film with fine performances.
Despite the honest, authentic ideals, Disney's traditional animation studios can't cope with the imagination or storytelling of their colleagues, Pixar.	The Princess And The Frog is old-school Disney - the first animation of theirs for a good 12 years to recapture the magic of their early 90s output.	Disney Animation is back doing what it does best -- musical romantic adventure with magic -- after 10 years of unfortunate forays into barnyard humor and science fiction (see the same directors' Treasure Planet or, better yet, don't.)	Though the humour is mainly for the kids, you may shed a nostalgic tear for that first time you witnessed the innocence of an old Disney cartoon.	Embora seja зtimo ver as animaушes tradicionais, em 2D, de volta ao cronograma de produусo da Disney, ainda nсo foi desta vez que John Lasseter conseguiu se estabelecer como um gЖnio tambжm neste departamento.	The warmth of traditional Disney animation makes this occasionally lightweight fairy-tale update a lively and captivating confection for the holidays.
Snyder has captured the look and feel of the novel, but that is not enough for a successful movie. It fails to totally engage its audience, somehow keeping them at arm's length.	Snyder's film is a breath-taking epic, a compelling thriller and an ensemble character piece, far beyond our expectations of the genre.	Not"Watchmen" but a not-so-incredible simulation that reduces a complex examination of the dynamics of dopey superhero epics into just another dopey superhero epic.	Think a darker and more philosophical version of Dark Knight . . . This movie adaptation will appease even the most rabid Watchmen comics geek out there as well as win new converts!	Great book, mediocre adaptation.	Gritty and visually striking, Watchmen is a faithful adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel, but its complex narrative structure may make it difficult for it to appeal to viewers not already familiar with the source material.
I actually found it to be a decent attempt to give young girls a fun, little fantasy as the boys their age are off watching giant robots pound on each other. But I can't recommend it to anyone else.(Full Content Parental Review also available)	For a movie called "Monte Carlo," this one keeps the stakes pretty low.	Shenanigans masquerading as fun.	The movie hits a surprising range of emotional grace notes, including several moments of genuine regret, and concludes with an understated moral lesson about the value of self-respect over social status,	A frothy, innocuous smorgasbord of girlhood wish fulfillment that scores a direct hit with its target demo.	Although it has its charming moments, Monte Carlo is mostly silly, predictable stuff that never pushes beyond the boundaries of formula.
Schroeder has made his best film.	... a powerful examination of the decline of civilization as refracted in one tiny corner of the world.	Rough, breathless adaptation of Fernando Vallejo's ferociously sardonic novel.	The grimness of the movie becomes not only too unbearable, its point is clear about halfway through.	A cautionary tale set in Medellin, Colombia, where even peace loving individuals become anesthetized by random carnage.	Director Barbet Schroeder presents a bleak, darkly humorous drama about hopeless love in Medellin, Colombia.
It's a genuine pleasure to find a movie with such a deep and intelligent portrayal of simple human lives, with all their minor triumphs and tragedies.	Rarely has a slice-of-life film been so delicious to consume.	When you boil it down, there are few movies that demonstrate as well how people's lives seem to randomly intersect, or how much of an impact we have on each other, whether we know it or not.	Foremost is the very adventure of experiencing an Altman film, his failures are better than most directors's successes.	One of the great films of the 1990s	Robert Altman's ensemble drama deftly integrates its disparate characters and episodes into a funny, poignant, emotionally satisfying whole.
An endearingly nutty, proudly analog tribute to the ultra-nerdy innovators of yesteryear, this quasi-mockumentary is easy to admire in spirit even when its haphazard construction practically defines hit-or-miss.	Sneakily, the best science-fiction film of the summer.	It's fashionable to dismiss mumblecore as prone to obtuseness, but Bujalski offers a wryly funny slice of nerd-vana.	...a movie of wry simplicity that has been subjected to all sorts of avant-garde tinkering.	A winning mix of deadpan comedy, retro stylings and escalating insanity.	With its delightfully retro production design, Computer Chess is an inventive, intelligent, and humorous comedy that celebrates the eccentricity and uniqueness of its subject.
A deeply meditative film with stunning visuals, Melancholia brilliantly captures the chaos and calm before the storm.	While I appreciated what it was trying to do, I wasn't wild about it.	Occasionally gripping, at times fascinating and often just plain dull, this terminally long and episodic drama with sci-fi overtones is a curious work	...a seriously oppressive piece of work.	A moving rumination on mental illness and maybe the first time since "Breaking the Waves" that von Trier has looked at one of his characters as an actual human being.	Melancholia's dramatic tricks are more obvious than they should be, but this is otherwise a showcase for Kirsten Dunst's acting and for Lars von Trier's profound, visceral vision of depression and destruction.
Brings the pain in genre fashion. But it's also a kind of Scandinavian gothic -- a love story between 12-year-olds, one of whom has been 12 for a very long time.	A spooky Swedish thriller that manages to break the rules of the genre while holding on to many of the rituals that remain dear to the hearts of vampire fans.	A smart and welcome vampire film. And although it provides the usual horrors, its most frightening one may be the stark loneliness of a child.	It is certainly one of the most accomplished and intriguing vampire films released in quite some time.	A remarkably moving horror tale, about a pale, bullied twelve-year-old boy (Kĺre Hedebrant) and his first love (Lina Leandersson), who happens to be a vampire.	Let the Right One In reinvigorates the seemingly tired vampire genre by effectively mixing scares with intelligent storytelling.
... a popcorn picture that does what it's supposed to do ...	... a blast.	From complete dismemberment to extreme shotgun violence, Aja & Co. not only pull out the stops on this one, they decimate them.	These Hills might have eyes, but they could have used some brains, or at least a steadier hand and a less contemptible sensibility to guide the grisly proceedings.	Good gorey fun.	Faster paced for today's audiences, this Hills remake ratchets up the gore for the hardcore horror fans, but will turn away casual audiences.
It's a brave choice for an actor, a masterful balancing act by Bacon that makes The Woodsman as insightful as it is disquieting.	A lot of credit for the power of The Woodsman has to go to Bacon for bringing out the full range of Walter's humanity, from his ugly impulses to his struggle to overcome them.	Kevin Bacon turns in yet another solid performance, strengthening his case as the most underappreciated talent in movies	Whether you think society should toss offenders in jail and throw away the key, or that rehabilitation may be possible, see this film -- if only for Bacon's stunning performance.	Here's a year-end "for your award consideration" release that does have a chance, at least in positioning Bacon for acting award kudos	Kevin Bacon's performance as a pedophile who is trying to start fresh has drawn raves from critics, who have praised the Woodsman as compelling, creepy, complex and well-crafted.
It's an exasperating exercise in B-movie hokum and screenwriter's gimmickry.	the central twist which unifies all the film's elements is so ingenious and unusual that recognising the killer ends up being just one small part of this film's multi-faceted identity.	Absurdly intricate and intricately absurd...like a slickly-produced puzzle whose pieces fit together just fine, but when completed depicts a scene not worth looking at.	Amanda Peet is "Paris," a call girl who dreams the dream of all call girls: To return to Florida and run an orange grove. What qualifies her for a life in agriculture? "In my profession," Paris says, "I love getting my hands dirty and making things gro	No way do you check out this tourist trap and leave with the remotest intention of ever checking back in.	Identity is a film that will divide audiences -- the twists of its plot will either impress or exasperate you.
It's as crazy as a crackpipe on a kayak, but the title alone proves that this is a hell of a lot smarter than it looks.	After a promising premise, it soon disintegrates into a preposterous predator/prey tale filled with brutality, bloodshed and butchery.	Unfortunately, in Getaway, the bad things that happen include a lazy script.	A hugely entertaining pulp thriller that delivers the goods in a stylish an effective manner that beats most other recent films of its ilk like a gong	[An] effective thriller.	While smarter than the average slasher film, A Perfect Getaway eventually devolves into a standard, predictable, excessively violent thriller.
It's fun stuff -- crackling, playfully escapist summer fare that doesn't make you feel taken advantage of later.	You've got your chases, you've got your explosions, you've got your destruction of property and death of innocent bystanders -- all this and bonding too.	Better than the first!	Kick ass sequel	Sequel adds Joe Pesci to the buddy cop formula.	Lethal Weapon 2 may sport a thin plot typical of action fare, but its combination of humor and adrenaline, along with the chemistry between its leads, make this a playful, entertaining sequel.
El Fantasma, como dice la canción, está ahí, inside my mind...	Sure it's kitsch, but this is a thrilling production, an epic date movie. The only problem is that Christine runs off at the very end with the wrong guy.	If you know nothing about the Phantom, currently the longest-running show on Broadway, this unusually faithful recreation will show what the fuss is about.	Should appeal to people who like musicals but cannot afford them, though this is not a particularly inventive nor a particularly cinematic adaptation.	The movie has no sense of its own ridiculousness.	The music of the night has hit something of a sour note: Critics are calling the screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's popular musical histrionic, boring, and lacking in both romance and danger. Still, some have praised the film for its sheer spectacle.
Only Prinze, who has the ethereal, gentlemanly quality of a young Anthony Perkins, gets enough screen time to really make an impression.	In the parlance of American Bandstand it's got a good beat and you can dance to it, but that hardly separates it from the rest of the pack.	Much better than you might expect.	Fortunately, Prinze and Cook offer up a good deal of adolescent charm, and they have a curious chemistry together.	A distinctly minor pleasure, but a pleasure nonetheless.	Despite its charming young leads, She's All That can't overcome its predictable, inconsistently funny script.
The stories and people presented here are involving enough to enthrall anyone.	... a heartening affirmation of the spirit that helped many dancers to thrive in their heyday more than half a century ago and to survive as teachers, dance devotees and priceless raconteurs.	Surprisingly heavy on its feet.	I would have thought that sitting there for two hours listening to people talk about ballet, of all things, would quickly put me to sleep. But I was fascinated and walked out of the screening invigorated.	An electrifying documentary by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine that lovingly and authoritatively brings to life an era of unequaled artistic excitement.	Even if you know little about ballet, there is much to love about this documentary's captivating archival footage and its interviews with elderly former dancers who have much to share.
Holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma.	Mr. Holm possesses the kind of skill that acting is all about: He can make an audience forget what they know and believe they are watching two different men.	Some of the shots are so elegantly composed that they resemble classic oil paintings.	Another day, another story. Rewriting history in 'The Emperor's New Clothes'	A fanciful drama about Napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility.	The premise of The Emperor's New Clothes is intriguing, and Holm gives a delightful performance.
A black and white movie of black and white quality	I recently saw Manhattan again, for perhaps the fifth time, and my absolute joy as I sat there surpassed any other Allen film in recent memory.	A film with a sharp look and some glinting lines. Still, it's the city that Isaac/Allen has a nostalgic faith in, not people, or love, or even the film itself.	This is a wonderful film, with a George Gershwin score that adds just the right amount of poignancy.	Manhattan is Allen's most fully realized film, especially in the way perspectives are developed. It's the rare movie that can be watched from a number of different points-of-view, without feeling cheated.	One of Woody Allen's early classics, Manhattan combines modern, bittersweet humor and timeless romanticism with unerring grace.
If ever there was a movie that should have gone straight to video - or better yet, never have been made - this is it.	Woefully unsuitable for children with its decades-old nods to R-rated films, 'Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil' is a far cry from the much cleverer original.	Kids have seen much better animation in other films, and it's hard to imagine too many grown-ups ready to smile and nod at yet more smirking takes on famous moments from Scarface and The Silence Of The Lambs.	A crazed, attention-deficit disordered blitz of one-liners that sees Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf chase evil fairy tale characters through a mad world in search of a secret truffle cake recipe.	A pale copy is still a pale copy, even when it's in 3-D. That's the moral of the animated sequel "Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil."	It may add 3D to the original, but Hoodwinked Too! is missing the first installment's wit and refreshingly low-budget charm.
Enthralling movie about the violent upheavals of war and the healing power of love.	Among many achievements, John Seal's strikingly precise photography draws contrast, which is significant in the text, between sensual imagery of the adulterous affair between Fiennes and Scott Thomas and jarring images of desert wartime brutality.	As the sensitive Hana, Binoche delivers one of the most incandescent performances I've ever had the pleasure to watch.	Highly, highly recommended.	It is testimony to the strength of this haunting story that it can sustain its fascination for every minute of its 21/2-hour-plus length.	Though it suffers from excessive length and ambition, director Minghella's adaptation of the Michael Ondaatje novel is complex, powerful, and moving.
...a well-crafted concoction, from the brilliant payoff of a running gag about KISS to its unique blend of crassness and huggability.	has an unexpected sweetness to it that builds to a fever pitch on several fields-of-honor, real, imagined, and legal	The movie, like its unlikely heroes, has its pungent moments. At its best, it balances salt and sap.	Role Models is a film for the nerds, by the nerds. Lucky for Role Models, the rest of our culture is catching up and are invited along as well.	An irresponsible frittering away of the cinematic capital amassed by Stiffler, McLovin and other beloved icons of the teen genre.	Role Models is a frequently crude, always funny comedy with the cast providing solid work throughout.
The trouble is that there's only so much emotional energy you can expend on these assholes before you start wondering why you're paying attention to them at all.	Although it gives us more characters than we can easily keep count of, it's hard to care about any of them.	An intense, playfully seductive and wonderfully spry little dramedy of thirtysomething strife and emotional wandering, ... [one of] the best foreign films released this year.	The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy.	Girlfriends are bad, wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy.	Well-preformed, but it's nothing we haven't seen before.
Magical? Not so much.	Like a great magician, Nolan makes the pledge, takes the turn and delivers the prestige.	By film's end, the notion of a rational and satisfying climax has hopelessly disappeared in a silly spiral of one-upmanship and a barrage of half-baked revelations that won't make you marvel so much as shrug and forget about them.	The Prestige retains a mesmerizing hold on the audience, and it returns magic to the realm of the real, where craftsmanship and stage presence are just as thrilling as the physical act of disappearance.	This guy knows how to tell stories for audiences who can hold their own hands, thank you.	Full of twists and turns, The Prestige is a dazzling period piece that never stops challenging the audience.
I can't think of a movie that matters less than Just My Luck. It's just negligible.	The assumption must be that those who see this PG-13 movie have been raised on a diet of bathroom-humor comedies and are not quite ready to let that go.	Lindsay Lohan's new romantic comedy, Just My Luck, is strictly for tweens.	Word on the street -- we're not sure which street -- has it that Just My Luck is Lindsay Lohan's final teen comedy. If so, the timing couldn't be better.	Lohan doesn't have the spark or charm she or the casting director thinks she might.	Just My Luck is a screwball rom-com that fails to take advantage of Lindsay Lohan's considerable charm. The film (along with Robert Altman's A Prairie Home Companion) marks the end of Lohan's teen queen phase as she begins playing characters that are older, but not necessarily wiser. Lohan's character is supposedly cursed with bad luck, though the movie confuses misfortune with plain stupidity, leading Lohan into a long series of silly and senseless physical gags.
Film is dotted with video jargon and ideology which proves more fascinating than distancing. And Cronenberg amplifies the freaky situation with a series of stunning visual effects.	It certainly sets the skin a-crawl, I'll give it that.	A horror film of unusual substance and vision -- the first film from David Cronenberg that announced his true importance as a filmmaker.	it feels like Cronenberg started with a great idea, and just wasn't sure what to do with it	Here, Cronenberg is a provocateur only to a point - boldly striding past boundaries of comfort but getting the heebie-jeebies upon approaching true profundity. But he wasn't too far from figuring out which incisions could cut the deepest.	Visually audacious, disorienting, and just plain weird, Videodrome's musings on technology, entertainment, and politics still feel fresh today.
The feeling of escapism that it generates quickly fades away.	Visually rich musical, with creative ballet finale.	Unforgettable musical is great for parents and kids alike.	Seven Oscars resulted in 1952, for once deserved.	It is both comfortable entertainment and eye-popping cinema, with its dream ballet acting as a showcase for what the movie musical can really do.	The plot may be problematic, but such concerns are rendered superfluous by Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron's star power, the Gershwins' classic songs, and Vincente Minnelli's colorful, sympathetic direction.
A word to the squeamish: there is no shame in leaving as the tools-and I use the word advisedly-come out. In a way, you will be getting the best of Antichrist, which until now has been a film of awkwardness, confusion, and great beauty.	A tough film on every level, and each viewer will have their personal and private response; but von Trier's cinematic flourish is undeniable	A psychologically horrifying, fascinating and emotionally devastating experience that should be studied, analyzed and discussed scene-for-scene by film buffs for its brilliant, stylish production values, allegories and allusions.	It's a far cry from Nicolas Roeg's excellent 1973 chiller Don't Look Now, which maintains a high-gloss art-house sheen yet draws us into its similar story of a couple coping with the drowning death of their child.	A cinematic violation made worse by the fact that von Trier is such a gifted filmmaker.	Gruesome, explicit and highly controversial; Lars Von Triers arthouse-horror, though beautifully shot, is no easy ride.
A hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention, a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of Claude Chabrol.	What a modern horror story!	Cantet takes his time, letting us become almost comfortable in Vincent's presence, then shocking us with the audacity of his lies.	Skip work to see it at the first opportunity.	Time Out, which looks great but moves like molasses, is more interesting than truly involving.	A haunting psychological drama, Time Out takes a penetrating look at the angst of the modern worker.
essentially a failed attempt to turn tragedy into farce	This is no comedy classic, but it delivers plenty of laughs, thanks to a witty script and no less than five very hilarious performances.	...a very funny movie - very funny indeed.	Clocking in at a mercifully short 83 minutes, pic spares us the endless ad-libbing, but isn't nearly as tight as its title implies.	It's plausible, crude, and fashionably grim - so why isn't it funnier?	It's sporadically funny and it benefits from a talented cast, but 30 Minutes or Less suffers from a disjointed narrative, and too often mistakes crude gags for true lowbrow humor.
Something New is an observant, clever riff on the familiar problems of romance and the career gal.	Breezily uncomplicated enough to enjoy relatively wide commercial appeal...	Emotionally satisfying and rings exceedingly true.	Look too closely and there will be questions about abandoned plot threads and excised scenes.	Something New is something new, though, in circumstance and point of view.	Something New tackles serious questions about race and interracial relationships with genuine appeal and an alluring romance that develops as naturally as the plot.
A fine, sincere piece of bittersweet delight.	...a visual swoon over the delights of flight.	One of Miyazaki's most personable protagonists, a delightful cast of supporting characters, and a rambling, episodic story full of charming incident and irresistible imagery.	A wonderful and enchanting animated film about a 13-year-old girl's initiation into adulthood through her adventures in a strange city.	[Miyazaki] revitalizes conventional tropes, using elegant imagery to say something substantial about growing up, and he even subverts gender stereotypes along the way.	Kiki's Delivery Service is a heartwarming, gorgeously-rendered tale of a young witch discovering her place in the world.
A devastating movie with some of the finest acting you're ever likely to see. But- it's very grim. Makes AWAY FROM HER look like AIRPLANE.	Amour is not an easy film by any stretch of the imagination, but for those in search of art without pretension or affectation, this is the way it's done.	Life is full of unfair horrors; that is why we go to the cinema. Amour is the cinematic equivalent of telling a child Santa doesn't exist.	Beautifully and bravely acted, Amour is an unflinching depiction of the daily toll that old-age degeneration exacts upon its victims. Should be required viewing for anyone intending to grow old.	All great films have imagination; this one also has the sense of experience.	With towering performances and an unflinching script from Michael Haneke, Amour represents an honest, heartwrenching depiction of deep love and responsibility.
The film as a whole means no more than Charlie Chaplin means. Nobody has ever been able to say what that is, but by the present showing it is something quite timeless and priceless, and more human than the best of alien words lugged in for definition.	Chaplin's political and philosophical naivety now seems as remarkable as his gift for pantomime.	the fact that it is one of Chaplin's great masterpieces is testament to both his artistic resilience in the face of industry change and the enduring power of great silent comedy.	Good physical comedy will always be funny, and Chaplin was a master.	The picture is a two-hour almost continuous gale of laughter with sidesplitting gags generously distributed throughout the five major sequences and the several minor ones.	A slapstick skewering of industrialized America, Modern Times is as politically incisive as it is laugh-out-loud hilarious.
Even at its very best, it's just all right.	Eventually wins you over with its warmth and offbeat sensibility.	Surges along on wry dialogue and energetic scenes, mixing spot-on parody with comments on the exploitation of the handicapped and the fads of the dance music industry.	The movie has two distinct parts... they may not exactly compliment each other, but I appreciated both.	Comes as something of a surprise when its final act actually manages to rally your sympathies. It has Paul Kaye to thank for this.	Part raucous mockumentary, part drama-filled biopic, It's All Gone Pete Tong amuses and warms hearts with its touching, comic, and candid look at a musician faced with a career-ending handicap.
Perhaps returning to his roots did the visionary director a great service since this "Frankenweenie" is the best Burton film in well over a decade.	The jokes are built almost entirely around references to old black and white horror movies.	Burton applies his visual trademarks, with spindly characters and a moody black-and-white palette, while he and his regular screenwriter John August pepper the story with fond references to classic horror movies and past stop-motion gems.	"Frankenweenie" is a mere 87 minutes long, which turns out to be just the right length; there's not enough time for Burton to go off the rails as he does in so many of his films.	Everything the perfect "family horror" movie should be.	Frankenweenie is an energetic stop-motion horror movie spoof with lovingly crafted visuals and a heartfelt, oddball story.
All in all, a very creditable film.	Eastwood's constant re-sketching of and playful ambivalence towards Eastwood-as-Star is brilliantly illustrated in The Outlaw Josey Wales.	Demonstrated Eastwood's ability to recreate his first starring role, as the mythic Man with No Name of the Italian Westerns, and to subtly undercut it through comedy and mockery.	The screenplay is another one of those violence revues, with carnage production numbers slotted every so often.	Eastwood is such a taciturn and action-oriented performer that it's easy to overlook the fact that he directs many of his movies -- and many of the best, most intelligent ones.	Recreating the essence of his iconic Man With No Name in a post-Civil War Western, director Clint Eastwood delivered the first of his great revisionist works of the genre.
The frequently stunning sights and sounds temper its lack of intellect. If Al Gore thinks this film is going to convert millions, let's not melt Mr. Freeze's fantasy.	Despite the horrific dialogue, the forgettable characters, and the frozen performances, The Day After Tomorrow is rentable.	After the destruction, the drama flails with an hour still to go.	A disaster movie has to be about more than the cool effects.	Most of the movie is spent watching Jack Gyllenhaal shiver ominously next to Steve Urkel.	A ludicrous popcorn flick filled with clunky dialogues, but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster.
A terrifically acted thinker in which every perspective is open to interpretation, and ambiguity and truth switch places depending on who's looking.	Contando com diálogos cortantes e concebidos (e ditos) com elegância, Dúvida mantém a força de seu título até os segundos finais.	As my dear friend and mentor Bill Wundram, of the Quad-City Times, has told me for 23 years: Beware the overly self-righteous.	Doubt is not exactly a tour de force, but the film succeeds on the wattage of its stars, Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a nun and priest at odds over an unspeakable suspicion.	This is a subtle piece of writing with major social questions raised with the answers, in the end, cloaked in ambiguity. Somehow, not getting the answers makes for a satisfying film...	Doubt succeeds on the strength of its top-notch cast, who successfully guide the film through the occasional narrative lull.
Sort of like what might happen if Jean-Luc Godard directed a Girls Gone Wild video, it's not just a movie that has its cake and eats it too. This is a movie that has its cake and eats more cake.	[Korine] turns his exploration into such a gonzo, outrageously funny party that it takes a while to appreciate that this is more of a horror film than a comedy.	Harmony Korine's remarkable fifth feature is like nothing the US maverick has ever done -- or anyone else, come to that.	The movie is too calculated to shock. Korine just wants to be the danger he's warning us about.	James Franco's performance alone is worth the price of admission.	Spring Breakers blends stinging social commentary with bikini cheesecake and a bravura James Franco performance.
An emotionally engaging film, mainly because of Denzel Washington's award-worthy performance.	Holding it all together is Washington's ferocious, bare-knuckle performance as Rubin Carter.	Too often The Hurricane falls prey to creeping Hollywoodisms.	Denzel Washington shows all the right moves!	The Hurricane simply loses focus on its strengths at times, wandering into familiar territory for its emotional catharsis.	Thanks in large part to one of Denzel Washington's most powerful on-screen performances, The Hurricane is a moving, inspirational sports drama, even if it takes few risks in telling its story.
The movie has few surprises for lifelong horror fans, but it'll keep them (or us -- I count myself in their number) happily diverted for just under 90 minutes.	If you are a viewer mature enough to withstand the stunning onslaught of gore without suffering nightmares, Ghost Ship is worthy entertainment.	The plot doesn't always make sense, despite a thunderous explicatory montage halfway through, but as a fresh setting for terror shenanigans, this Ghost Ship is somewhere between B minus and the High Cs.	They should have left this ship alone and saved me ninety minutes.	A whole movie's worth of characters shouting, "Is that you!?," becomes more grating than scary.	With a plot as creaky as the boat, Ghost Ship fails to deliver the scares.
Phildelphia is a good idea, just not a particularly good film.	Philadelphia may not be the film Demme's fans expect--its emotionalism is unfiltered by cool. But it has the power to open more than a few blinkered hearts.	Excellent performances and the sensitive handling of complicated issues.	Manages to be humorous and moving without being too preachy or heavy-handed.	Conveys the hornet's nest of ignorance, prejudice, half-truths and devastating lies connected with AIDS.	Philadelphia indulges in some unfortunate clichés in its quest to impart a meaningful message, but its stellar cast and sensitive direction are more than enough to compensate.
For a tragedy that carries a strong emotional kick, it's wickedly fun.	Probably the best adaptation of the celebrated novel you can find.	A sombre, manipulative affair in which the decor is never allowed to usurp our interest.	Tantalizingly wicked -- watching it makes the color rise to your cheeks.	An absorbing and seductive movie.	Stylish, seductive, and clever, Stephen Frears' adaptation is a wickedly entertaining exploration of sexual politics.
Strikingly shot and savage in its violence this is a white-knuckle ride through the most dangerous corners of the Brazilian city.	When this Enemy Within settles into key action sequences, such as a stunning nighttime ambush or a daytime battle against Fabio, it becomes wildly entertaining.	An epic crime drama from Rio de Janeiro with a thrilling pace and an over-the-top body count.	It's a complicated story told in a single extended flashback with brilliantly staged set pieces and offering an appalling picture of the city that is to host the 2014 Fifa World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games.	It resembles a flow chart splattered with blood and spittle, more static and smeary in tone than the finger-pointing corrective director-cowriter Jose Padilha intended.	Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is a bleak, violent descent into the Brazilian underbelly, ripping into the favelas with unstoppable and kinetic force.
Oscar-dominating 1970s weepie that is just waiting to be rediscovered.	It's the old wash, but so well done that we can overlook Benton's manipulations of our emotions and let our feelings flow.	Hoffman excels at being an Everyman, a modern professional whose life is rearranged by a child, a movie cliché that he pulls off without a trace of melodrama.	In confronting marriage break-up and its impact on children, [it] still provides an outlet for audiences to relate to these difficult issues, which is still a wonderful thing.	There is so seldom even one great performance in a movie that three is too much to expect. For that reason alone, this story of a couple battling for custody of their young son is a remarkable achievement.	The divorce subject isn't as shocking, but the film is still a thoughtful, well-acted drama that resists the urge to take sides or give easy answers.
It's at least unintentionally funny and could wind up with a kind of demented cult following.	Jordan Scott's confident directorial debut is a faintly ridiculous, sexually overheated mixture.	Lame period film set in a remote girls' boarding school never takes off. All-too-familiar tensions among students and their troubled instructor go unresolved.	Cracks totters on high heels and strikes all manner of poses in the mirror. Sooner or later it's bound to fall over.	The film unfolds primarily as a case study of both a vaguely fascistic individual and a group subject to that individual's magnetism.	Atomospheric but not much else, Cracks is a formless film in search of compelling drama.
This thing is so confident, so very well-constructed, and it goes down smooth from the very first frame to its absolutely perfect final shot.	McDonagh's script is agile, darting between the ridiculous, the sage and the surprisingly sentimental. His love of language and the absurd has hints of the wisecracking Quentin Tarantino. But the story is decidedly more rooted in Ireland's loamy turf.	An impish and impudent black comedy that knows where it's going and how to get there, it gives veteran actor Brendan Gleeson one of the tastiest roles of his career and introduces a gifted writer-director with a familiar family name.	John Michael McDonagh's droll debut feature makes an ideal vehicle for Brendan Gleeson as an eccentric cop battling drug dealers in the west of Ireland.	If you can imagine the whimsicality of "Local Hero" crossed with the dark, British Isle ruralness of the "Red Riding" trilogy if its criminal elements had immigrated from "Fargo," you'll have an idea of McDonagh's deft tonal touch.	A violent, crackerjack comedy with a strong Irish flavor and an emminently likable Brendan Gleeson in the main role.
Produced under the Scott Free banner (Ridley and Tony Scott, producers), it's surprising that such Hollywood heavyweights would choose a script that's so woefully bare.	Plenty of authentic laughs and great supporting performances make Welcome to the Rileys a decent film.	...an uncompromising movie about the compromises people sometimes have to make in order to save themselves - and others. It's about doing what's necessary and right, instead of what's moral.	"Welcome to the Rileys"? Thanks, but no thanks.	The actors and admirably sensitive director Jake Scott (son of Ridley) can't compensate for Ken Hixon's long slog of a script.	Despite earnest performances, Welcome to the Rileys cannot escape its belabored over-sentimentality and sluggish delivery.
John Sayles' finest effort to date.	"Lone Star" has the usual assets and drawbacks of a John Sayles movie, two fine reasons to go and see it.	It is among the best films of the nineties and the best independent features ever made in the United States.	Sayles' latest never bores during its 21/4-hour unreeling. But neither does it soar, despite finessing a complex flashback narrative set in 1957 and present-day.	Well over two hours with not a single minute wasted.	Smart and absorbing, Lone Star represents a career high point for writer-director John Sayles -- and '90s independent cinema in general.
The fourth, most commercially successful Bond to date, is known for its pre-credits sequences, underwater battles, and escalating number of violent deaths.	It's remarkably good fun. It's retro enough to be amusing in the dull bits and timeless enough to be fresh and vital today.	A big step down from Goldfinger, but still moderately entertaining.	While enjoyable, this is probably the most overrated Bond movie.	A particularly energetic, jaunty Bond adventure, the kind that is just plain fun to watch, in a perfectly relaxed and undemanding register.	Lavishly rendered set pieces and Sean Connery's enduring charm make Thunderball a big, fun adventure, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the series' previous heights.
Its abuse of nostalgia is more frustrating than entertaining and the same can be said for Dan Fogler.	Overall "Take Me Home Tonight" represents a lateral move at best for its 24-hour party people, a step back at worst, and not worth your time either way.	The screenplay hangs a lampshade on the trope of people who are stuck in time.	An amiable diversion, kept afloat by some comic moments of the raunchy, silly variety, and by something that does feel rather retro: a kindness to its youthful characters.	If you're going to set your comedy in the same universe as the classic '80s comedies of John Hughes, you better make sure your movie is good enough to withstand the comparison.	It has a charming sweetness about it, but Take Me Home Tonight is neither funny nor original enough to live up to the comedies it evokes.
Parental Content Review	This Italian-themed romcom is not quite the most unspeakably-patronising-to-Italy film of all time. That prize belongs to the musical Nine, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. But it runs a very close second.	Never mind that the script is far fetched. The plot, the characters and the dialogue - individually and as a whole, simply do not work. The ideas fall as flat as a squashed sausage, and that includes Danny DeVito's sausage king	one of those romantic comedies that's compelled to spell everything out for its audience at 10 minute intervals	It's not as bad as it appears to be from the trailers.	A pair of young, attractive leads can't overcome When in Rome's reliance on unfunny gags and threadbare rom-com clichés.
A would-be sophisticated frolic so droopy and inane that the plot holes and dull performances almost obliterate the gorgeous visuals.	Jolie provides the sultry action, and Depp offers some sweet, goofy laughs, and in the end no one got sunburned or suffered from food poisoning.	What's not to enjoy?	Von Donnersmarck's meat-and-potatoes direction makes The Tourist astonishingly lifeless and awkward, reducing two of the world's biggest movie stars to something akin to shy, pimply teenagers on their first date.	As shallow as the Venetian scenery is beautiful with a preening Jolie and a lackluster Depp stuck in what appears to be a painstakingly long travel commercial.	The scenery and the stars are undeniably beautiful, but they can't make up for The Tourist's slow, muddled plot, or the lack of chemistry between Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.
A profound disappointment, given its cast and source material.	Appears to be a somewhat sinister episode of Nightline.	Why was Hopkins, the best of whose films is ordinary, hired to construct a film which hangs on psychology and dialogue?	It's never as good as it should be, with occasional moments of brilliance overshadowed by the gimmicky direction of Stephen Hopkins.	Though flawed and not nearly as electrifying as the material promises, the project still squeaks by thanks to taut direction and solid acting.	Though Hackman and Freeman turn in solid performances, Under Suspicion moves at a plodding rate and has a disappointing ending.
It's an interesting idea, deserving of a more interesting treatment, but this is just dopey and patronising.	The film's wry wit and understanding of childhood anxieties will remind older viewers of the television series The Wonder Years which is no small compliment.	A clever movie with a smart message, 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' far surpasses its dopey-looking ad campaign.	The writing is funny during individual moments, but the cumulative result is a bit depressing, with a surprising amount of negativity. If anything, the pervasive doomed feeling of junior high is too accurate. Who wants to pay money to relive that?	There's something silly-sweet about this movie. It avoids talking down to kids or being didactic, while still projecting an overall wholesomeness.	Unlike its bestselling source material, Diary of a Wimpy Kid fails to place a likable protagonist at the center of its middle-school humor -- and its underlying message is drowned out as a result.
Operates in a limbo between the relentlessly moronic and the legitimately entertaining, while almost solving the vehicular existentialism suggested by its title.	Gratingly unfunny.	Even if Dude, Where's My Car? would rate a zero on the Laugh-o-Meter, at least it is a fairly good-spirited and colorful film that produces a few smiles.	Instead of sticking to its nugget of potentially inspired idiot satire ... Dude flies off on a tangent and gets way lost, dude.	A jaw-dropping intergalactic caper 'comedy' where no less than the fate of the entire universe is at stake.	The movie isn't funny, the plot is too thin, and the production values feel more like a TV sitcom than a movie.
Before it's all over, the real siren songs of time and place turn the visual kitsch into a distilled Americana that's unexpectedly stirring.	The performances by George Clooney and Coen regulars like John Goodman and John Turturro are simply a delight.	Until now, the Coen brothers' movies have been condescending but clever, smirky but clever, heartless but clever, vague but at least vaguely clever. O Brother, Where Art Thou? has all of those ingredients except cleverness.	The Coens' dark edges inevitably creep in and make the film just unpleasant enough to dislike.	Praiseworthy.	Though not as good as Coen brothers' classics such as Blood Simple, the delightfully loopy O Brother, Where Art Thou? is still a lot of fun.
The best thing about The Skeleton Key is that it is not a remake of a recent Japanese horror film. The second best thing is that it is pretty scary.	Though the story is as creaky as a plantation porch, Iain Softley's lushly atmospheric The Skeleton Key does offer a few nifty twists on the classic 'woman in peril' picture.	That old black magic is back in theaters this summer, bottled up in a frightful delight that just might rattle your bones.	It's basically Rosemary's Baby, Cajun style, with a pinch of Amityville Horror for kick.	The movie ultimately comes off as a kind of wannabe that doesn't get where it wants to go.	Thanks to its creaky and formulaic script, The Skeleton Key is more mumbo-jumbo than hoodoo and more dull than scary.
A fantastic success.	If you don't leave the theater humming, then you'd better check the adjustment on your hearing aid.	One of the liveliest and most enjoyable animated flicks to escape the House Of Mouse.	Overall, it's an enjoyable film, thankfully free of the computerized look of later Disney cartoons, but it really can't compare to the real Disney classics.	The start of a run of modern Disney animated classics.	The Little Mermaid ushered in a new golden era for Disney animation with warm and charming hand-drawn characters and catchy musical sequences.
Director Renny Harlin keeps the wall-to-wall action hurtling along at such breakneck speed, that it's not hard to get swept up in the crash-and-explode craziness of it all.	If you leave your brain in neutral, you should have a fairly enjoyable ride.	As brain-off Friday night entertainment, it almost suffices - but only because the quality of brain-off Friday night action has been lowered so significantly in recent years.	There's a decent little action movie somewhere inside '12 Rounds': a bit more complexity of character, a few more jokes and a hero who doesn't look like a two-by-four with a buzz cut might have gone a long way.	suffers from more or less the same problem as The Marine: it's stupid, but not quite delightfully stupid	Energetic but empty, 12 Rounds' preposterous plot hurtles along at a rapid pace, but can't disguise the derivative script.
I Love You, Man makes sure to give audiences exactly what they're expecting, but I couldn't shake the sense that the whole thing felt compulsory.	It's a one-joke pony, but director John Hamburg and his screenwriters manage to stretch it to nearly two hours of hilarity and quasi-profundity.	An amusing scenario gets a big boost from winning performances all round - which lift it well above other bride vs. buddy 'triangle' japes like, say, You, Me And Dupree.	The comedy I Love You, Man marks the overdue emergence of Paul Rudd as a star.	Although Rudd and Segel are charming guys, and it can be a kick to watch them throw improvised riffs at one another, that's not sufficient justification for an entire movie.	I Love You, Man makes the most of its simple premise due to the heartfelt and hilarious performances of Paul Rudd and Jason Segel.
A solid triple.	Works better as a romance than as a sports flick, but it's still sly, smart and very funny.	Writer/director Ron Shelton lobs juicy lines to players Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, and they all hit home.	Bull Durham is a jaunty, refreshing comedy that mixes sex The ambling pace and inventiveness of Bull Durham are the doing of Shelton, a filmmaker worth watching. This film is a tidy summing-up of one aspect of America`s favorite sport.	One of the best baseball movies of all time, as well as one of the sexiest romances ever put on celluloid. Sarandon is smart and sizzling.	Kevin Costner at his funniest and most charismatic in Bull Durham, a film that's as wise about relationships as it is about minor league baseball.
Abrams' intimate POV renders everything that much more harrowing (or "nauseating," depending on your shaky-cam tolerance and the general condition of your inner ear).	A fascinatingly wrought experimental film that holds you in awe at what Reeves and his production crew was able to pull off, inspiring more appreciation than a gut level sense of being there.	Will grab you in its jaws, toss you around like a chew toy for a rollicking 80 minutes (yes, it's a short - but oh so sweet - flick) and still leave you panting for more.	Simply put, I haven't had so much fun in the movies in years...	Crudely naturalistic yet innocative and effective.	A sort of Blair Witch Project crossed with Godzilla, Cloverfield is economically paced, stylistically clever, and filled with scares.
Love conquers lucre in the cosmopolitan fairytale Priceless, a Kir Royale of a romantic comedy pairing Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh on the French Riviera.	Sometimes a trifling comedy can seem infinitely better when it comes packaged in a foreign language, especially French. Pierre Salvadori's Priceless, though, seems like the sort of thing that would be amusing in any tongue.	It might remind you of those early-'60s capers that starred a different Audrey -- Hepburn.	...one of the more unusual love stories you will see...a priceless gem, a certainty to be on my list of most enjoyable films of 2008.	A charming French romantic comedy that salutes love as the only thing that can truly turn your world around.	Priceless is a light, farcical rom-com that features sharp performances from Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh.
The acid exchanges and inconvenient longings of a dissolving marriage, the exquisite agony of those first flutterings of love and those first earthquakes of lust.	In charting the effects of a divorce on the two adolescent sons of literary parents, Baumbach revisits the time, place, and events of his young adulthood in a manner that is at once sentimental and a little sneering.	Baumbach's real achievement is his deft ability to balance the emotional brutality of joint custody with the natural humor of domestic life.	Mining his own chidlhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself.	Photographed in a rough-hewn, French New Wave style befitting its alienated characters, The Squid and the Whale significantly fulfills the promise of Baumbach's 1995 debut feature Kicking and Screaming.	This is a piercingly honest, acidly witty look at divorce and its impact on a family.
A gripping, survivalist drama with more humanity than expected.	As stripped of colour as its title, apart from the red of flowing blood and burning eyes, The Grey urges contemplation on man as the human animal, one suddenly cast into the wilderness where real beasts dwell.	a wild ride and will answer the question of how long you can hold your breath, and then quickly knock it out of you. Cinema seats will be torn apart, popcorn will fly and there might even be a few tears	I can't say I was sorry it was over. But it also has the stark purity of an icicle; it earns my respect if not my love.	Carnahan captures the primal sense of story that infused the best work of Jack London...the sense that Mother Nature is a powerful force, and not a benevolent one.	The Grey is an exciting tale of survival, populated with fleshed-out characters and a surprising philosophical agenda.
This movie will only frighten you with its crudeness.	Rendering this film fairly pointless.	How to review a critic-proof movie.	I am certain someone can make this movie into a credible drinking game...go with a bunch of friends, don't hope for a new watershed in satire, and you'll have an OK time.	This movie, by any name, would be as entertaining.	Critics say Scary Movie overloads on crudity and grossness to get its laughs.
Fake punk-rock has its own visual language, and the opening minutes of Stick It--movie about that most punk-rock of sports, gymnastics--piles on the "Do The Dew" clichés	Jessica Bendinger looks to do for gymnastics what her Bring It On did for cheerleading: namely, give a stereotypically girlie-girl activity some defiant, individualistic attitude.	The use of the prim but rigorous world of women's gymnastics as a setting for teen rebellion is so strained it leaves the pic's ode to personal authenticity feeling as phony as a dubious decision by a competition judge.	This is a movie for fourteen-year-olds that feels like it's been written by one.	There is a positive message in the film, often obscured by the bogus punk attitude.	Director Jessica Bendinger is unable to transfer her winning Bring It On formula to the world of gymnastics, despite Missy Peregrym's strong lead performance.
Poor special effects, a silly looking werewolf and clunky comic writing help to spoil what should have been a fun B-movie.	It wanders for quite a while, seemingly unsure what it's supposed to be doing.... I wanted to snap my fingers to get the movie's attention and say, 'Movie! Over here! Focus!'	This film could easily be the Springtime for Hitler of horror movies.	The only good thing about this film is that Christina Ricci is still channeling Wednesday Addams.	It's disheartening to see three so extraordinary talents as Craven, Williamson, and Ricci create so distinctly ordinary a product. (Unrated Version)	A predictable plot and cheesy special effects make Cursed a less-than-scary experience.
I didn't pay nine bucks for this in the theater. I know which movies are worth paying for, and which barely merit an absent-minded dumping to the bottom of my NetFlix queue.	Offers up the kind of pleasures that only a summer movie can.	A worn-out yawner of a cop thriller where even the cliches seem to realize how dated they are.	The ludicrousness reaches often dizzying proportions, yes, but -- the crucial, mitigating measuring stick for any action movie -- its excitement does not flag.	S.W.A.T. is mostly standard-issue muddle.	A competent, but routine police thriller.
No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas.	"Twilight" popularly defined vampire cinema in the Zeroes. But Team Blade could execute every last sullen Cullen. When Blade turns full vampire - suplexing and flying-elbow-dropping people like a crazy Mexican luchador - 'tis pure fanboy nirvana.	Vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order.	It culminates in some pretty amazing fights and plot twists, and you may rest assured that good eventually triumphs, none the worse for wear except being drenched in blood.	This isn't a horror movie with enough emotional resonance to cause nightmares, but it may inspire you to take a long bath before going to bed.	Though Blade II offers more of what worked in the original, its plot and character development appear to have been left on the cutting room floor.
While the young actors are all fine at spoofery, we get the impression that only Long, McKean and Cole really understand the joke.	Part homage, part spoof, the deft balancing act is a clever, engaging adaption.	If dumbness is a large part of our problem, then The Brady Bunch Movie is a small (and oddly cheery) part of its solution.	There are a surprizing number of good laughs, but in the end it's an NBC movie of the week filmed in 35mm.	This is enormous fun, one of the best TV adaptations to date, and guaranteed to provoke a nostalgic misty eye and mischevious grin in anybody who's ever owned a crimplene tank top.	Though lightweight and silly, The Brady Bunch Movie still charms as homage to the 70s sitcom.
It's shoe-string scary, delivering a terrifying, unsettling 90 minutes without a single bit of CG or foam latex in sight, and all confined to a single house.	It has a few good scares, but one has to sit through nearly 80 minutes of mind-numbing tedium before the payoff ...	The fact that its old-school scares caused seemingly jaded 20-somethings at a recent midnight screening to squirm in their seats suggests that there's hope for the world after all.	The fear of the unknown and what may lurk in the dark shadows of your own home creates moments that set the heart racing in this subtle, understated little shocker.	After the disturbing experience of squirming through this astonishing movie, you'll be wide awake with lights blazing and may never want to sleep again.	Using its low-budget effects and mockumentary method to great result, Paranormal Activity turns a simple haunted house story into 90 minutes of relentless suspense.
As vacuous as the backstage glitz and debauchery it pretends to criticize.	[Wahlberg] continues to draw on his versatility and range, shedding the albatross of his hip-hop background and establishing himself as a genuine leading man.	Herek's made a bloated concept album about faith and redemption and left off all the good songs -- the ones that make you wanna pump your fist in the air, wave your Bic and scream for vengeance.	There are no shades of gray, and by the end when Chris finds what he wants, you begin to wonder if he found Jesus too.	Generally plays itself out with the plodding, high-decibel predictability of a Steel Dragon ballad.	Like its title, Rock Star is rather generic, being not so much about the heavy metal scene than about rock cliches and formula.
Eastwood grunts, snarls, curses and gives young punks the stink-eye with precision, playing his most racist character ever for entertainment and comic purposes.	An extraordinary spiritual movie about an angry, lonely, bigoted old man whose his heart softened through his relationships with members of a Hmong immigrant family who live next door.	Eastwood's volleys of racial slurs are so outrageous it's as if Dirty Harry embraced his inner Don Rickles...	Gran Torino is made without fuss and acted out with the kind of natural grace only a real titan of the cinema could manage. And Clint is a titan - one of the best directors in America and a performer whose range has extended mightily throughout his career	In front of the camera, the 78-year-old actor still appears able to demolish anyone who messes with him, which is why this showcase works as well as it does.	Though a minor entry in Eastwood's body of work, Gran Torino is nevertheless a humorous, touching, and intriguing old-school parable.
The film's far from perfect, but it was entertaining, engaged me throughout and offered up a nice dose of surprise,	First-time screenwriter Charles Randolph has figured out a way to combine his message movie with a more generic race-against-time thriller. And while the combination provides a kind of novelty that works for a while, it ultimately falls apart.	Instead of mounting a fierce argument against socially sanctioned killing, Parker gives the other side ammunition and allows those predisposed to executions to exit feeling smug and reassured in their beliefs.	Deserves the chair for its brutal assault on subtlety.	Director Alan Parker pitches the melodrama on high boil, and his way of dealing with all the holes in Randolph's plot is to place huge, almost defiant exclamation points around them.	Instead of offering a convincing argument against the death penalty, this implausible, convoluted thriller pounds the viewer over the head with its message.
Ultimately disappoints because it doesn't share its subject's sense of the outrageous.	Carrey's portrayal is dead-on, with all the little mannerisms and voice inflections.	More of an illustrated résumé than a character study, entertaining but seldom insightful.	Jim Carrey se ha empeńado en mostrarle al mundo que sabe actuar y lo está logrando	Presents the life of a madcap trickster who desperately wanted to be the biggest star in the world.	Jim Carrey is eerily dead-on in his portrayal of Andy Kaufman, which helps to elevate Man on the Moon above the script's formulaic biopic cliches.
An amiable goof of a comedy.	Diverting but ultimately toothless and innocuous.	...a fine premise that's utilized to progressively underwhelming effect...	It's a slightly lackluster comedy that wants to have something to say, but never gets around to saying it. Or worse, says it, and the audience replies, 'And--?'	A respectable, intelligent film, but one, to be sure, that prospers more while in the individual moments, rather than one that remains deeply ingrained in your long-term memory.	If it's not as ambitious as The Truman Show in satirizing the voyeuristic nature of television, EdTV is an amiable, witty comedy with fine performances from Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.
The many special effects -- some retouched on film by hand -- are quaint by today's digital standards, but that only makes them all the more fun.	Rains, with his silky, slightly superior-sounding voice, emerges as pathetic not grandiose, and the film clips along with boundless energy.	A wonderful, insightful, goofy, bizarre look at a strange case.	The story is one of those great mad scientist tales in which the potion invented with the best intentions for its enhancement of human life becomes instead an evil force bent on its destruction.	One of my favorites, Claude Rains, in the title role. He's only visible at the end, so gaining the audience's favor must have been a challenge using only his voice and plenty of bandages. The invisibility formula drives him insane. Excellent film.	James Whale's classic The Invisible Man features still-sharp special effects, loads of tension, a goofy sense of humor, and a memorable debut from Claude Rains.
Lean achieves a fine balance of creating complex characters from a fine cast, while keeping the pace up throughout this long movie.	Did Lean ever make a bad film?	Alec Guinness' outstanding performance is one of the many things that work in David Lean's intriguing epic.	For what it is, it ain't bad, though it serves mainly as an illustration of the ancient quandary of revisionist moviemakers: if all you do is systematically invert cliches, you simply end up creating new ones.	Antiheroic war epic.	This complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean.
As is, for the preteen crowd, this sequel will have enough movement and comedy to satisfy. But there's probably too little of either to justify a Cody 3.	Even by kiddie-flick standards, this one, directed by Kevin Allen, is astonishingly lame.	Although Muniz still has his Tiger Beat looks, his performance is worse than phoned in -- it's text messaged.	As ingenious and lively as the original film.	It is credited to three writers, which stuns me, because I know plenty of writers who could have written something this bad single-handedly.	Young kids may find this London adventure fun, but older kids may find it too simplistic.
Each scene is composed like a painting, and frames a comedy as weird and wonderful as the film's title: A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence.	This iconoclastic filmmaker seduces you with ridiculous laughs, then sends you home contemplating your mortality and your place in the world.	There are few better ways to waste time than in the company of a Roy Andersson film - immaculately crafted eyesores that delight and challenge in equal measure.	It's a series of comedic sketches about people who are too self-involved to empathize with each other. It's also a plaintively blunt wake-up call, and an effective demand for viewers' vigilant sensitivity.	A Pigeon Sat On A Branch Reflecting On Existence is very much in the same mold as its two predecessors, which is part of the problem.	Expertly assembled and indelibly original, A Pigeon Sat on a Branch concludes writer-director Roy Andersson's Living trilogy in style.
It's often very funny, looks great and is played to perfection.	Bernadette -- formerly Ralph -- turns out to be an excellent role for Stamp.	You may have Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive' rattling through your head for a few days, but that's a small price to pay for an audience with true royalty.	Both an unalloyed delight and a surprisingly human, moving film.	Outrageous, in a calculated way, the film's success relies heavily on the players, and fortunately, Stamp, Weaving and Pearce are up for it.	While its premise is ripe for comedy -- and it certainly delivers its fair share of laughs -- Priscilla is also a surprisingly tender and thoughtful road movie with some outstanding performances.
Sounding intriguing enough in concept, Death misses the mark onscreen in a way adaptations of deceptively cinematic novels often do.	This is better than the dull Edward Norton vehicle The Illusionist, all involved should have conjured up a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's The Prestige.	Pearce's boys-adventure take on the vaudeville legend is a hoot, though not nearly as laughable as the dialogue or Zeta-Jones's pitiful attempts at basic emoting.	In every technical department, the film is impeccable but at the core there's something rather frustrating about it.	Despite the confused tone and underwhelming romance, this pretty little picture entertains in the main thanks to the intriguing subject matter and top turns from Zeta-Jones and Ronan.	Pretty but dull, with unconvincing turns from Zeta-Jones and Pearce. If you want a period magician movie, seek out The Prestige or The Illusionist instead.
Loud, colorful and affecting.	It was so visceral and inherently theatrical off Broadway that at first I thought it was a terrible mistake to commit it to film. But, in one of those rare unforseeable happy endings...	Less an exploration of transsexuality than an inquiry into the nature of wholeness, "Hedwig" successfully transports the off-Broadway hit into the world of cinema.	For all its serious subtext, the movingly affirmative Hedwig is raucous, racy and full of hilarious, lowdown survivor's wit.	A ball of gender confusion, Biblical allegories and Eastern European politics -one of those would be a tricky subtext for a 90-minute rock opera. But the songs marry Jim Steinman's grandeur to the Stooges' sweat and spit, with a deft, tender screenplay.	Hedwig and the Angry Inch may very well be the next Rocky Horror midnight movie. It not only knows how to rock, but Hedwig's story has an emotional poignancy.
...an upbeat confection that boasts a robust celebration in spotlighting the confusion of the indelible heart set against the luscious Barcelona baroque backdrop...gleefully impish	A Big Mac with a mineral water chaser.	Klapisch and smug narrator-hero Xavier (Romain Duris) seem certain that we requested a picture of international student life at its most superficial and eventless.	A lighthearted, good-natured motion picture that contains enough humor to leaven the tone and keep the drama from becoming too serious.	Full though shallow, a swell trip to Barcelona.	This multicultural comedy captures the chaos and excitement of being young.
What do you say about a mediocre movie adaptation of a literary masterpiece? Could have been worse? Or, it could have been much, much better, but even then it probably wouldn't measure up to the original?	Almost as sweet as the children's classic novel, "Charlotte's Web" is just, well, crawling with entertainment.	Some will bristle at liberties taken. Cows do indeed break wind. Yet the movie's use of flatulence is less a nod to rural truths than a reliance on what has become a go-to gag in movie's made for the booster-seat set.	As my daughter noted after the movie, Wilbur isn't any ordinary pig. As Charlotte writes in her web, he is 'some pig.' That, he is, and here he gets his just due with a movie that honors his humility and grace in fine fashion.	Not magical, but a fresh adaptation of the classic children's book about a spider that saves a pig from the smokehouse.	Kids will be entertained by the straightforward plot and cute animals, and adults will be charmed by how quiet and humble the production is, a fine translation of E.B. White's genteel prose.
While the characters feel very simplified at times, there are scenes that put great weight on performance and subtle expressions, in a way that's nearer to the classical Disney tradition than most Japanese animation.	The latest film from the esteemed Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli.	It's more deeply satisfying and complex than similar, Hollywood-produced fare - like fine wine compared with Kool-Aid.	It's wondrous to watch the enchanted Princess, given a title but not a name, swell instantly into twice her size in the arms of the Bamboo Cutter's wife.	Like all fairy tales worth their salt, the movie trusts children to take on the big themes of life, death and despair included, and thus removes the sting.	Boasting narrative depth, frank honesty, and exquisite visual beauty, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a modern animated treasure with timeless appeal.
The unstoppable Anna Faris has perk in her pipes and a pep in her step, but a bum script working at every turn to tear her down. That's a shame, because with the right material, Faris could do very well, indeed.	Let's hope Anna Faris' next project looks past her outer beauty and unleashes her inner weirdo.	...it's hard to deny the effectiveness of Anna Faris' energetically go-for-broke performance...	Fish-out-of-water formulaics are lifted by a starlet on the up. The story is pure bubblegum, but surrender to the silliness and you'll be endeared. A must for anyone who's been hanging on for Legally Blonde 3.	What else can you say about a movie when Christopher McDonald counting to 30 is the funniest thing that happens in it?	Anna Faris is game, but she can't salvage this middling, formulaic comedy.
It just may be one of cinema's most grotesque exposes of denial.	You almost feel as if Satan's personal assistant had decided to pull up a chair and tell all. Is it possible not to be interested?	If Junge's first-hand recollections aren't always visually stimulating, they're still more illuminating than most cinematic re-creations of the era.	'Filmmakers Andre Heller and Othmar Schmiderer take the golden opportunity to try and lend some insight regarding the world's most notorious Fuhrer in the resourceful documentary Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary.'	Which is more fascinating -- the personification of evil or the humble creature who innocently served him?	The testimony of Junge is more than enough to make this bare-bones documentary fascinating.
The blockbuster action thriller genre is ripe for sending up, but this lazy effort has to go down as a miss despite the presence of spoofmeister Leslie Nielsen.	Sporadically funny, but never more than a sting of crude gags.	Filled to the bursting point with witless, sub-Mad magazine movie parodies, pointless cameos by a seemingly endless parade of has-beens, and once-hysterical, now stale jokes lifted straight from Airplane! and the original Naked Gun...	Spy Hard just comes off as a long commercial. And yes, that means most of the best moments you've seen in the movie's trailer.	This movie unfortunately wastes a perfectly promising idea -- satirizing James Bond films along with any other pop-culture celluloid phenomenon that crosses the filmmakers' minds.	Leslie Nielsen's comic gifts are undisputed, but Spy Hard's lazy script and slapdash direction fail to take advantage of them.
After a ropey patch, Bond is categorically back.	a great follow up to goldeneye	It succeeds, although it is let down by its weak villain. But there are enough stunts, quips and high-tech thrills to keep you from caring.	The winsome pic gives the people what they want. At least, what they want from the Bond franchise.	Brosnan is credible, Pryce is memorably malevolent, and Yeoh is good if miscast, but Teri Hatcher shoots blanks.	A competent, if sometimes by-the-numbers entry to the 007 franchise, Tomorrow Never Dies may not boast the most original plot but its action sequences are genuinely thrilling.
The best Woody Allen film in years.	A welcome return to form from a really talented guy who's been churning out cinematic junk for the past few years.	The details are so complex and interconnected, it becomes more comfortable to let it all wash over you and simply appreciate the passing pleasures.	Instead of two half-hearted resolutions to Melinda's dilemmas, I would have preferred one fulfilling one.	As a fan of professional athletes ... Woody Allen has seen plenty of players who hung around past their prime. Too bad he didn't take the hint.	Woody Allen's uneven Melinda and Melinda fails to find neither comedy nor pathos in what seems like a rehash of his previous themes.
It's minor, but powerfully so.	The Kid With a Bike grabs at the heart.	"The Kid With a Bike" comes and goes in 87 minutes, but its beauty and intensity stay with you long afterward.	...when they (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) hit the mark they create understated but deeply moving dramas that are uniquely their own. 'The Kid with a Bike' is their latest effort and it is among their best.	"The Kid With A Bike'' is, remarkably, about hope - about the connections people forge when the ones they've been given desert them.	Thanks to the Dardenne brothers' typically fine direction, The Kid with a Bike is a heart-wrenching, thematically and spiritually rich drama.
Somebody ought to declare open season on these copycat movies, but in the meantime, you could do a lot worse than this bright-looking, lightly amusing excursion from the Sony's Imageworks CG division.	A couple of years ago, this might have been something special, but with so many talking animal films out there, it just ain't.	Lawrence proves much less irritating as an animated bear than he does in his real-life performances.	What elevates Season is the wit and enthusiasm of its voice actors -- particularly Kutcher and Sinise. They both sound like they're having a fantastic time, and it's hard not to be swept along with them.	Some theaters are showing the movie in IMAX 3D, which is the way I saw it. The novelty helps, but it still can't bring depth to entertainment this shallow.	Open Season is a cliched palette of tired jokes and CG animal shenanigans that have been seen multiple times this cinematic year.
Lucy Walker's observant film Blindsight is about profound East-West differences in the importance of journey versus destination and comradeship versus competition.	Blindsight is hugely affecting, the rare experience that will make those who watch it thankful for what they have, yet make them realize that they aren't nearly thankful enough.	If anyone tried to tell you a story about this climb and these kids, Blindsight is exactly what you'd think it should look like.	Lucy Walker's documentary is genuinely stirring.	Walker's documentary hails from the inspirational school of filmmaking, and graduates with honours.	A powerful glimpse of the possibilities for transcendence in straightforward documentary filmmaking -- and extreme physical disability.
This unnerving chiller rises above genre conventions to deliver its own kinds of cool dread and surprises.	It envelops you in a time and space that is unfamiliar, fascinating, exotic, and frightening all at once.	Anthony Shaffer penned the screenplay which, for sheer imagination and near-terror, has seldom been equalled.	There are few entries in Seventies cinema in which the efforts, the ideas, and the execution transcend the implications of cheap, genre filmmaking, and there are none as thematically appealing as The Wicker Man.	It's a heady brew, but Hardy keep the mystery simmering, while his staging of several merrie pagan songs -- and of course the chilling climax -- is truly memorable.	This intelligent horror film is subtle in its thrills and chills, with an ending that is both shocking and truly memorable.
like its predecessor, exists primarily to get luscious private detectives Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu in one tight spot -- and one tight outfit -- after another. ...wears its attention-deficit disorder as a badge of honor.	Nothing deeper than a stale retread, it seems. And this observation comes from a critic who listed the original Charlie's Angels movie as one of the top five films of 2000.	Sorry, Charlie: Full Throttle stalls out in the clutch.	It's one of the worst films of 2003.	Thankfully, McG never permits the film to be crushed under its own weight.	Eye candy for those who don't require a movie to have a plot or for it to make sense.
The classic tale of a Mafia family. Not for kids.	Aquel que no ha visto El Padrino no puede decir que ama al cine	Story-wise, there is so much going on that it would have been easy for a director to lose control, but Coppola (helped by a screenplay co-written by Puzo) keeps it all together beautifully.	The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood.	All of the filmic arts - design, cinematography, editing, music - come together to forge what is, by any measure, one of the great movies of all time.	One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.
Though Mr. Chaney wears a more grotesque make-up than ever, the film play seems only pretty good.	Who needs sound, color or even opera? We have Lon Chaney at his peak and that is more than sufficient.	An eerie mixture of poetry, gothic melodrama and a surreal Feuillade-style serial.	The new facelift and the truckload of supplementary materials serve to keep the film both timeless and accessible - while affording a true classic of the Silent Era the immortal respect it certainly deserves.	The main inducement to watch remains Chaney's tragic, ineffably sad figure.	Decades later, it still retains its ability to scare -- and Lon Chaney's performance remains one of the benchmarks of the horror genre.
You can't afford not to see this modern masterpiece.	The fact that a filmmaker as gifted as Lee has yet to top the movie says a lot about its power.	Lee's theatrical piece speaks the Truth, Ruth. And it just ain't simple.	The movie has a tone and a perspective of its own. But all too often, the tone is tiresome and the perspective banal.	The movie's volatile subject has overshadowed the fact that Do the Right Thing is quite funny and a technically superb picture that easily ranks as the best movie Lee has made.	Smart, vibrant, and urgent without being didactic, Do the Right Thing is one of Spike Lee's most fully realized efforts -- and one of the most important films of the 1980s.
The Immigrant is two hours long, but I stayed even longer in my seat, through the credits, still in thrall to it all. The title is singular, but the scope is not so easily quantifiable.	The beating heart of the movie is Cotillard, whose saucer eyes recall those of imperiled silent-screen legends like Lillian Gish.	As haunting, and haunted, as any of [James Gray's] prior achievements.	Memories upon memories upon memories upon legend upon lore upon sorrow upon sacrifice and ache: there is much of another time in James Gray's great and tender and sublimely sincere, emblematically cinematic "The Immigrant."	Gray directs this handsome and evocative film with emotional restraint, making its archetypal title character a living individual whose moral journey is never simple.	Beautiful visuals, James Gray's confident direction, and a powerful performance from Marion Cotillard combine to make The Immigrant a richly rewarding period drama.
One of the few recent Hollywood films out there that has used new digital technology to truly engage the viewer, and make possible a thoughtful story.	An immensely intelligent entertainment!	Funny for about half an hour, Pleasantville thereafter becomes an increasingly lugubrious, ultimately exasperating mix of technological wonder and ideological idiocy.	Overcomes its moralising and occasional pomposity with magical photographic effects.	Hollywood satire is not usually this enjoyable: Both savage and silly, Pleasantville is an absolute blast.	Filled with lighthearted humor, timely social commentary, and dazzling visuals, Pleasantville is an artful blend of subversive satire and well-executed Hollywood formula.
The Butabis (Will Ferrell as gangly Steve and Chris Kattan as weasely Doug) are especially dismal to watch for 80-something minutes, more like Pat than Wayne and Garth.	Crap!!!!!	It would take far better writing than Kattan, Ferrell and Steve Koren can muster to make it less than an ordeal.	Audiences are likely to be as repelled by this lame & lamer combo as their would-be dance partners, because underneath their shallow and clueless veneers is just more shallowness and cluelessness.	The director, John Fortenberry, whose background is in television, has probably done the best that can be done with characters who were never meant to speak.	Has the same problems as the worst SNL movies: one-note characters and plots unreasonably stretched to feature length runtime.
What finally dazzled me about the film is the way that Resnais cleverly put together a 94-minute film without ever taking a stand on any single thing; every single shot, detail, story, and character is suspect -- and subject to change without notice.	Marienbad is elegantly hermetic, a ravishing waxworks that has stillness at its heart.	The movie itself is puzzling and contradictory, a self-conscious work that seems only half-remembered even as it wills itself into being on the screen.	The beautiful last gasp of black-and-white cinematography	A veritable masterpiece, but beware, this icon of French New Wave cinema is as likely to irritate as it is to mesmerise.	Elegantly enigmatic and dreamlike, this work of essential cinema features exquisite cinematography and an exploration of narrative still revisited by filmmakers today.
The movie, by the end, practically seems intent on destroying itself.	Dreadful.	A diffuse, uninvolving star vehicle aimed at saving Stallone's box-office viability manages to display most of his weaknesses.	'90's Stallone action movie guilty of nonstop violence.	This slam-bang Stallone vehicle never quite delivers what its confident, fizzing visuals seem to promise.	Judge Dredd wants to be both a legitimate violent action flick and a parody of one, but director Danny Cannon fails to find the necessary balance to make it work.
Old School revels in its raunchiness as it strives to be a 21st century Animal House. Unfortunately, the shadow of that timeless classic weighs heavily upon this uneven comic venture.	Grade A goofball fun.	A movie that might make your face hurt with laughter and has its heart in a high-enough place while its mind is in the gutter.	Luke Wilson is a charmer, as always, but his doormat of a dork [can't] carry even this slight tale.	Old School has all the ingredients of an uproarious campus comedy, but it lacks a boisterous short-order cook who could whip up a food fight or three.	While not consistently funny, the movie does have its moments.
It's a new year, and a new romantic comedy, and a new opportunity to observe that Amy Adams' hair really is very pretty, and...sorry, I nodded off there for a minute.	The lethal lack of humor keeps the audience from getting any pleasure out of it.	Forgettable all around.	Not only does this film's release miss the Leap Year day, month and year, but with its babbling script, flat characterizations and flaccid direction, the entire project misses. It is, if nothing else, beautifully consistent	There may be more masochistic ways to spend this coming box-office weekend than by taking in a matinee of Brit director Tucker's soulless, Lifetime-lite flibbertigibbet of a movie, but for once I'm at a loss to think of any.	Amy Adams is as appealing as ever, but her charms aren't enough to keep Leap Year from succumbing to an overabundance of clichés and an unfunny script.
All glitz and glibness, the film makes 1960's ego party, which had the mock substance of happy-hour celebrity, seem rather deep.	Ocean's Eleven is probably the best brochure for Las Vegas tourism since Robert Urich's Dan Tanna cruised the Strip in television's Vega$.	Ocean's Eleven seems as if it coasting by on reputation alone.	Stealing from the thieves...but not in a bad way.	Vastly superior to the 1960 Rat Pack original, it boasts a well-structured, if engagingly improbable, story line and a glistening cast that performs with brio.	As fast-paced, witty, and entertaining as it is star-studded and coolly stylish, Ocean's Eleven offers a well-seasoned serving of popcorn entertainment.
A white-knuckle ride to the edge of town, I liked it in a sick and twisted sort of way.	The performances are astonishingly strong--edgy and kinetic, open and fearless.	The traumatized critic must struggle to avoid capital letters in urging patrons to steer clear of the colorfully cast but unbearable Spun.	This debut feature from Swedish director Jonas Akerlund takes the audience on a wild ride with such squirmy authenticity that it leaves you feeling in need of a long shower.	Boring it's not.	A chaotic drug movie that has little substance behind the stylistic flash.
Dated by todays standards, but still some effectively creepy moments.	It once seemed creepy, but time has made it seem pretty contrived.	really more about the deep-seated, primal fear of family members inflicting violence on each other than it is about ghosts and demonic spirits.	full review in Greek	A middling horror entry from 1979 that's a masterpiece when compared to the dreadful 2005 remake.	Dull and disappointing, the best that can be said for The Amityville Horror is that it set a low bar for its many sequels and remakes.
While not visually explicit, "Persepolis" is an uncompromising look at the culture of Iran as seen by an observant and open-minded child...	Persepolis feels abstract, never deeply personal, because Satrapi offers only surfaces and push-pin thoughts while sharing here sincere but glib sisterhood with Iranian history.	The diffused momentum arguably suits the subject: that's teen turmoil for you, heightened here by the troubles of time and place.	Clicks on ever level, visual and narrative, with a sort of inventiveness that seems intoxicated by the liberating possibilities of cinema.	It's riveting.	Persepolis is an emotionally powerful, dramatically enthralling autobiographical gem, and the film's simple black-and-white images are effective and bold.
Serious, funny, reflective and satisfying. You won't be sorry you sought this out. It's darn near perfect.	Yang has the rare ability of allowing us to savor the texture and weight of the moments that slide by us hour after hour, day after day without ever becoming ponderous or boring.	Yang orchestrates this tale of love and loss like good classical music -- shading with just the right grace notes and shifting eloquently from one sequence to another.	Yang ties a dozen strands together elegantly with a mostly amateur cast.	A sublimely moving and aesthetically rigorous experience overflowing with universally recognizable situations and characters.	In its depiction of one family, Yi Yi accurately and expertly captures the themes and details, as well as the beauty, of everyday life.
Spy Kids is flat out a good time for the whole family.	It's entertaining and inoffensive, a rare combination in kids' films, which are usually neither.	Even the biggest skeptics of the 'kids as super spies' conceit will likely find themselves looking forward to the already-in-the-works sequel.	The kids' movie kids have been waiting for.	I've been trying to think what was the last popcorn movie  let alone the last popcorn family movie  that was as much sheer fun as Spy Kids.	A kinetic and fun movie that's sure to thrill children of all ages.
Gentlemen and ladies: Don your goggles!	A galvanizing experience in terms of sight and sound.	It turns out that racing around an oval track offers surprisingly few opportunities to exploit 3D effectively.	Race day comes and the experience is mildly disappointing -- better at the speed game than a conventional camera, to be sure, yet still far from the real deal, and well below the standard set by our own God-given peepers.	Its rampant corporate sponsorship is messy and distracting, and the athleticism necessary to triumph is still less intriguing (perhaps because it's less visible) than the athleticism necessary to triumph in, say, baseball.	A thrill ride for fans, but those looking for a deeper experience will be choking on exhaust.
Appropriate to its teenage milieu, the film isn't unlike spending a couple of hours with an exceptionally witty high-schooler: It's entertaining as hell, but you can't help rolling your eyes a little at its self-satisfied pseudo-profundities.	Effectively mixes humor and heartbreak, avoiding many YA traps	"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl" succumbs to the same cloying too-cuteness and solipsism that often plague its glib and sentimental genre. But those limitations are leavened by the film's lively, ultimately affecting flourishes and sprightly voice.	Me and Earl is far from a celebration of missing out on the depth and complexity of the people around you. It's a reminder that a life spent skimming the surface of those people is an opportunity missed.	If you like your "indie" films smart, fun, funny, touching, heartfelt and bittersweet, I imagine you're going to want to join 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)	Beautifully scripted and perfectly cast, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is a coming-of-age movie with uncommon charm and insight.
It still packs a wallop. Maybe that's because, in cinema, we're all peeping toms. And the camera, in skillful hands, can be an exquisite instrument of terror.	While Hitchcock's masterpiece is unquestionably the more mainstream and formally groundbreaking of the two films, it's arguable that Peeping Tom is the more thematically profound and insightful work. Just don't expect to feel good after watching it.	It is now justly recognized as a classic of its disturbing kind, treating its material with a restraint, seriousness, and compassion that many of today's filmmakers could learn from.	Measured, methodical, and conceptually perverse.	The original first-person horror film.	Peeping Tom is a chilling, methodical look at the psychology of a killer, and a classic work of voyeuristic cinema.
...most importantly, Mulholland Drive offers filmgoers a chance to experience a true auteurial voice. Lynch has singular vision. See Hollywood through his eyes.	Stands as one of the director's best works in years.	A maddening, masterful experience.	The most seductively unsettling thriller about Hollywood corruption since that other street-name masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard.	Elegantly haunting, assured but still deeply mysterious.	David Lynch's dreamlike and mysterious Mulholland Drive is a twisty neo-noir with an unconventional structure that features a mesmirizing performance from Naomi Watts as a woman on the dark fringes of Hollywood.
You should watch because Larry Kramer's play is so much more than an agitprop relic from the early years of AIDS - it is a great play that has become an even greater television film.	A character-oriented drama with theatrical talent and values that would face challenges finding much purchase at the modern-day multiplex. The result is a movie, for mostly better and sometimes worse, that wears its heart on its sleeve.	A riveting drama about three years in the early AIDS crisis and the struggle of a gay writer fighting the indifference of so many people to this epidemic in New York City.	The Normal Heart will drive any viewer with a heart at all to tears.	It is a movie packed with sublime performances and searingly memorable moments.	Thanks to Emmy-worthy performances from a reputable cast, The Normal Heart is not only a powerful, heartbreaking drama, but also a vital document of events leading up to and through the early AIDS crisis.
One of the most audacious, confounding, and ultimately exciting pieces of cinema to hit the screen in years.	On the whole, Tarantino is in dazzling command of his story's myriad moods, and there are sequences as gripping and suspenseful as any ever put on celluloid.	The way that this picture has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.	[VIDEO] After reinventing American cinema with his thrilling first film "Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantino delivered an even better one, "Pulp Fiction."	Pulp Fiction is the best film of 1994, and of this decade.	One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones.
For all its visionary brilliance, the movie version of Interview never lets us close enough to see ourselves in Louis. We're dazzled but unmoved.	...the movie's aggressively overlong running time often does threaten to negate its positive attributes...	The movie may well make money, but no matter how many zillions it grosses, Tom Cruise will forever after be something of a joke.	...something for everyone: heterosexuality, homosexuality, eroticism, murder, mayhem, pedophilia, necrophilia, nudity, gore.	Why would Tom Cruise be playing Lestat, a gaunt, suave European vampire with a taste for young men? Because a big movie star can do whatever he wants.	Despite lacking some of the book's subtler shadings, and suffering from some clumsy casting, Interview with a Vampire benefits from Neil Jordan's atmospheric direction and a surfeit of gothic thrills.
As a ghost story and adaptation of the Stephen King novel, it's largely a failure. On the other hand, as an example of directorial bravura and as a study of madness and the unreliable narrator, it's a brilliant success.	As in 2001, Kubrick likes ghost stories more than I do. And he gives me enough else, in the way of acting and bizarrely beautiful surroundings, to keep me happy.	The beauty of Kubrick's film is the ambiguity of it all . . . will leave the gears turning long after the credits stop.	If Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is not the best haunted house movie ever made, it is certainly among the most intricately constructed.	An immortal classic.	Though it deviates from Stephen King's novel, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a chilling, often baroque journey into madness -- exemplified by an unforgettable turn from Jack Nicholson
Posh, stylish, and with very little going on in its head, Bon Voyage is neither as dizzying nor as entertaining as it could be.	...a film drenched in rich character and drunk with the buffoonery of life amid chaos and circumstance. It's a rousing Gallic gem.	A high-wire act of storytelling, tone and old-fashioned chutzpah.	Bon Voyage has much to commend it - but by the time it is over, you will be more likely to bid it a relieved 'adieu' than a dewy-eyed 'au revoir'.	Playing out farce under the shadow of fascism, this French thriller-romance-comedy-drama is an unusual film -- and an unusual pleasure.	It's froth, but stylish and giddily entertaining.
Arguably the most vital and eye-opening documentary yet made regarding the United States' current military entanglement.	The film is one of the most urgent and immediate nonfiction works we may ever see.	The film succeeds because of its refreshingly low-key emotional approach and its refusal to impose character arcs or political agendas on its subjects' footage.	A fascinating chronicle of wartime, told by several distinct and vivid narrators.	The filmmakers did a masterful job assembling the extensive footage, and creating a coherent beginning (the soldiers' deployment), middle (tour of duty), and end (the return home).	Candid, eye-opening footage gives viewers a close-up -- and educational -- look at the experiences of American soldiers in Iraq, a viewpoint not normally seen.
One of the year's best films.	The film has become noteworthy for its extended graphic sex sequences, but it shows depth in its exploration of sexual identity and socioeconomic class.	Viewed independently of the argy-bargy surrounding it, Blue Is the Warmest Colour is simply a remarkable work of cinema.	The sex is specific; everything else the two young women do is utterly general. Hearts will break but life goes on.	For its intelligence, sensual daring and fecund human empathy, this film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and you can certainly see why.	Raw, honest, powerfully acted, and deliciously intense, Blue Is the Warmest Color offers some of modern cinema's most elegantly composed, emotionally absorbing drama.
Francois Truffaut's debut film not only galvanized the Nouvelle Vague movement of French cinema, but he also generated a personal filmic idiom that he would elaborate on for the rest of his career.	A remarkable confluence of talents are at work here.	Alive with the joy of filmmaking for its own sake.	This bleak ending, with Antoine turning to stare into the camera, is among the most famous shots in cinema history, and for good reason.	An engaging, moving film.	A seminal French New Wave film that offers an honest, sympathetic, and wholly heartbreaking observation of adolescence without trite nostalgia.
For most of its length, 21 seems like a cautionary tale ... at least, until the whole point is negated by a tacked-on happy ending.	The film goes through the motions of a thriller, but few thrills result.	Like the Strip itself, it's all lights and music throbbing so hard you confuse yourself into thinking you're having fun.	It tries to be as slick and as cool as an MTV music video, but it completely busts.	While I'm firm believer in the adage 'Never let the truth get in the way of a good story,' 21 doesn't spin a good enough yarn to justify all the changes.	21 could have been a fascinating study had it not supplanted the true story on which it is based with mundane melodrama.
Open Hearts is far from inaccessible, but it demands a higher level of concentration than most big-budget movies do. The drama exists in a glance or a nod, or in a slight hesitation in speech.	Open Hearts is a heart-wrenching soap opera that even The Young and the Restless can't compete with.	A picture of lovely simplicity and directness that reveals something of the complexity of the human heart with marvelous understatement.	A startlingly real film that packs remarkable emotional power, and gives a glimpse of the kind of genuine human depth that the Dogme decree was meant to tap into.	An emotionally honest character piece that avoids moralizing or offering soggy excuses.	Pulsing with honesty, this film lays bare the rawness of human emotion with a story made all the more believable thanks to its gritty, low-budget approach.
Instead of elevating his peers, as actor and co-writer Adam Sandler drags them down to a low-level reunion comedy, in which most of the jokes are anticipated and life lessons simplistic and predictable.	Sandler takes cinematic art to new levels of orgasmic ecstasy. I'm lying...it stinks!	If you thought writer-producer-actor Adam Sandler would never stoop lower than Little Nicky, here's the unwelcome proof that you were wrong.	Five forgettable characters reunite for a (lame) joke-filled weekend.	Infantile, a puerile, pitifully sloppy comedy about a bunch of guys suffering from arrested development made by guys who apparently actually do.	Grown Ups' cast of comedy vets is amiable, but they're let down by flat direction and the scattershot, lowbrow humor of a stunted script.
An intelligent and high energy science fiction tale that is a lot of good old fashioned fun.	Joins the ever-growing membership of 2000's Gutless Endings Club.	patented Schwarzenegger formula movie	The setup of the script by the husband-and-wife team Cormac and Marianne Wibberley is intriguing -- just not cleverly executed.	A sublime premise for a movie turned into an unsurprising Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle.	This offering from Arnold Schwarzenegger contains an intriguing, disturbing premise, but the film's execution is too routine and formulaic to make good use of it.
Well acted, but not often believable, dysfunctional family drama.	Now and then, a scene will hit you in the gut, such as when Streep restyles Keaton's chemo wig. When sentiment is this honest, it's not hard to swallow.	At times attractive, at other times dull.	In many ways it looks an awful lot like one of those generic made-for-TV disease-of-week movies.	The performances are overwhelmed by cinematography so gorgeous and distracting it makes the drama seem like just so much wheel spinning.	Marvin's Room rises above the pack of dysfunctional family dramas thanks to an impeccable cast that includes Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton, and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Despite knowing how the attack ends, the tight confines of the mission and the danger lurking behind every closed door make for a breathless cinematic experience.	The story of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden builds relentlessly to a powerful end result.	Bigelow's commitment to a dispassionate, stripped-down approach results in a film whose impact sneaks up on you, leaving you blindsided by its visceral final reels.	Zero Dark Thirty is a skillful -- and somewhat cautious -- look at military bureaucracy. It's both hampered and elevated by its dependence on authenticity.	It combines ruthlessness and humanity in a manner that is paradoxical and disconcerting yet satisfying as art.	Gripping, suspenseful, and brilliantly crafted, Zero Dark Thirty dramatizes the hunt for Osama bin Laden with intelligence and an eye for detail.
Another of those recent horror pictures that you resent while in its presence and forget immediately afterwards.	Douglas rushes through everything, building a monotonous, anxious hum without mixing it up or giving the audience a break.	This is a slightly better-than-expected remake of the 1979 film of the same name.	Lots of 'jump' scares accompanied by loud bursts of soundtrack music, creepy dead girls wandering the halls, and almost no actual suspense or horror.	Go see it -- the perfect antidote to the overly-intellectual horror films we've suffered lately: a scream-a-minute, lighthearted thriller.	A so-so remake of a so-so original.
Ellis manages a few sudden shocks, but he and the editors never discovered the secret of ratcheting up suspense.	Far from groundbreaking, but it is good, schlocky fun.	Cellular is the year's first feel-good thriller.	A slick, unpretentious little film that's content with glowering villains, winsome protagonists and plot twists that provoke the occasional mild gasp.	Its adroit use of suspense makes you overlook the silliness.	Though it's gimmicky and occasionally feels like a high-end cell phone ad, Cellular is also an energetic and twisty thriller.
Visually, this is another leap for 3D and robotic cameras.	Some great shots of some odd (alien) deep sea fish and a good tie into space exploration, but other than that, the 3D isn't that great and reaction shots go too long.	The 48-minute spellbinder will make your jaw drop with awe. And, like the best documentaries, it will also make you think.	Like many IMAX films, it's worth a look for the razzle-dazzle photography, but don't expect much in the way of serious science.	It's good that a kid, and maybe even an adult, may want to 'touch' one of the so-called aliens thrust out for our inspection. But more important, a kid, and maybe even an adult, may want to become a human scientist.	An amazing array of images from beneath the sea.
Combining CG with matte paintings, models and animatronics, writer/director Guillermo del Toro fosters the fun and ingenuity that fuel this often-confusing horror fantasy.	The film may end up being so popular that a sequel may be discussed but I hope it's nixed. Part of 'Hellboy's' joy is its freshness.	Played by Ron Perlman, he's the most magnetic action hero I've come across in a long while, though I couldn't make heads or tails of this story.	While the character of Hellboy is entertaining, the film in which he appears is largely an exploitative jumble.	With all pro's and con's tallied, Hellboy stands as a durable popcorn entertainment with definite potential to become a franchise.	With wit, humor and Guillermo del Toro's fantastic visuals, the entertaining Hellboy transcends the derivative nature of the genre.
My Best Friend's Wedding is effective -- some might say manipulative -- at winning you over to its side.	A wonderful commingling of talent both on-screen and off.	One of the things that makes My Best Friend's Wedding such a terrific romantic comedy is that it refuses to play it safe.	For those of us not so enthralled with Ms. Roberts, you'll have to endure the movie, but will be mildly entertained with good, old music and some stellar comedy provided almost entirely by Rupert Everett.	This amiable comedy may not be hugely sophisticated, but Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.	Thanks to a charming performance from Julia Roberts and a subversive spin on the genre, My Best Friend's Wedding is a refreshingly entertaining romantic comedy.
Admittedly, there's a certain fascination in watching Kidman deliver these lines. You can see her struggling to make acting decisions with a character who requires none.	The trailer gave away what this movie needed to give us lots of: surprises. Sweet, funny, amusing, but never gels.	Outside of the perfomers, which include Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell and a nicely tuned supporting cast, there isn't much to look at here.	When 'Bewitched' clicks, it's primarily because of the cast. ...The Ephrons are far better at concocting acidic one-liners than they are at constructing a coherent storyline.	Instead of smart commentary on the state of entertainment, we're given a mundane, risk-averse romantic comedy.	Bewitched is haunted by scattered laughs and a lack of direction.
Though made the same year, Spielberg's awe-inspiring sci-fi fable has held much better than Star Wars due to his sublime crafstmanship, which benefits from sharp imagery and F/X, and engaging story and charcaters, well-acted by Richard Dreyfuss and others	Another classic from Spielberg's most fertile period.	Has just not held up.	This 'collector's edition' will probably go down in film history as the definitive one unless, like me, you think the movie works best in its original version, wherein the special effects of adult delinquency are left unknown.	Spielberg answers the "Are we alone?" question in fine form.	Close Encounters' most iconic bits (the theme, the mashed-potato sculpture, etc.) have been so thoroughly absorbed into the culture that it's easy to forget that its treatment of aliens as peaceful beings rather than warmongering monsters was somewhat groundbreaking in 1977.
A fitfully amusing romp that, if nothing else, will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star, Frankie Muniz.	The makers of Big Fat Liar understand kids. That alone earns it a place in the list of genuinely funny comedies for kids.	Confounds expectations and turns out to be one of the happiest surprises so far this year...coasts along on a wave of good, clean fun.	It's hard to think of two young actors who could pump as much life into a movie as Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes do in Big Fat Liar.	A kid's comedy with plenty of laughs, a sneaky wit and the abundant charm of its teen stars, Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes.	Though there's nothing that offensive about Big Fat Liar, it is filled with Hollywood cliches and cartoonish slapstick, making it strictly for kids.
Sгo poucas, as vezes em que podemos realmente dizer 'Nunca vi algo assim!'. Este filme consegue se encaixar nesta rara descriзгo.	Disturbingly smart and joyously weird. A true original.	Unlike most comedies, which go for laughs without worrying about depth, Being John Malkovich has both.	A hilariously novel conception.	Lunacy is par for this film's course, made visual by Lance Acord's creatively demented cinematography.	Being John Malkovich is both funny and smart, featuring a highly original script.
While the film takes a lot of unexpected turns along the way, its ultimate destination is obvious from the beginning.	This movie only shows true tact and understanding when it comes to flattering the audience; everyone on-screen is strictly up for grabs.	Toni Collette gives a wonderful performance.	This is the classic ugly duckling fable retold for our generation and given a different and imaginative development.	[A] gleeful, gaudy tribute to one ungainly misfit and her determination.	Heartfelt and quirky, though at times broad, Muriel's Wedding mixes awkward comedy, oddball Australian characters, and a nostalgia-heavy soundtrack.
It's a tribute to the transforming power of reading and a reminder of the Sisyphean task that reading can be.	You're not likely to see a more impassioned and heartfelt tribute to the joy of reading.	A film that librarians and readers everywhere will cherish.	Mark Moskowitz ? has made a quaintly interesting, but too long (at 128 minutes), self-involved docu-mystery for the literary-minded.	An unalloyed treasure for any viewer who has ever felt transformed by reading a good novel.	This fascinating documentary will be of most interest to those who read and write for a living.
Kids may not get all of Brooks' Old West parody.	The finale offers the most daring 15 minutes in cinema history	[The] huge popularity of this film, still uncontested after so many years, really shouldn't be that surprising.	Chalk up Blazing Saddles as only a lampoon of Hollywood westerns and you miss the point by a Texas mile.... Its humor is the palliative that lets Brooks mock prejudices and, with gloves off, prejudiced people.	Hats off to Mel Brooks!	Daring, provocative, and laugh-out-loud funny, Blazing Saddles is a gleefully vulgar spoof of Westerns that marks a high point in Mel Brooks' storied career.
A terrible waste of a cast, script, and my time.	A terrifying movie that faces the truth of cruelty and its everlasting results.	One wonders why Dafoe is even in the movie. But Nolte is, and that's what enriches Schrader's bleak drama.	Living in a small New England town myself, I can attest to how uncannily realistic the town and the people in it appeared to be.	The heart of Affliction is Nick Nolte's searing performance.	Dark and bleak, the "kick-ass" performances, especially Nolte's "effective" portrayal of an abused soul, is the reason to see this film.
A movie you seem to watch through translucent eyelids...	Watching it, you're pulled in so completely that you begin to lose your bearings, too.	...there's little doubt that the film is occasionally just a little too uneventful for its own good.	That's what makes this such a strong coming-of-age story; we feel Mona evolving, but until the last few frames, we aren't sure what or who she's become.	It is, in short, a very good coming-of-age story of love and obsession, but not a remarkable one.	My Summer of Love is a moody, bittersweet love story featuring outstanding performances from the leads.
...the sweet nature of the "What a Girl Wants" should get a big draw from female teen population	What could have easily have been a carbon copy of The Princess Diaries benefits from the efforts of its strong cast.	Never fails to live down to your expectations.	I really did enjoy it, overall, and here's why: the considerable charm of Colin Firth.	If it was possible to do a racist movie about the British, this would be it.	Little girls will definitely enjoy it, but it's too syrupy and predictable for adults.
Thornton...has the most subtly expressive, heavily crevassed film noir face to smoke a dangling cigarette since Humphrey Bogart.	Ed may be very well be the man who wasn't there, but that's not the only thing absent from this letdown of a motion picture.	Vastly entertaining and boasts several excellent performances.	Even for longtime Coen fans, this is a movie that isn't all there.	Joel and Ethan Coen stay true to their bent for dense heroes and neonoir, and to their unshakable conviction that life usually turns out to be splendidly horrific.	Stylish but emotionally distant, The Man Who Wasn't There is a clever tribute to the film noir genre.
The film has [Baumbach's] usual strengths: sharp urban insights, brainy comedy, moments of inspired high exasperation. It also shares a few of his faults.	Highly recommended for anyone feeling wistful about their youth.	Noah Baumbach's best movie since 2005's The Squid and the Whale, While We're Young navigates into more mainstream territory while losing none of the writer-director's rueful wit.	Baumbach's own acutely observed this-is-life laffer features his most relatable characters yet.	Both young and old will find a lot to laugh at in this film, which has Baumbach's frothiest dialog and shrewdest characterizations.	Poignant and piercingly honest, While We're Young finds writer-director Noah Baumbach delivering some of his funniest lines through some of his most relatable characters.
Quality entertainment. There's lot of action, thrills, adventure and some great landscape...The performances are great	An exciting Western packed with frontier violence and starkly beautiful images.	...tips its 10-gallon hat to John Ford’s classic The Searchers, then takes its own unique path along the western genre trail...	Apparently the only thing tougher than endurance on the frontier is sitting through a movie about endurance on the frontier -- at least that is the point The Missing seems determined to make.	Blanchett and Jones elevate what could have been a desultory Western-throwback genre picture to a film with surprising emotional bite.	An expertly acted and directed Western. But like other Ron Howard features, the movie is hardly subtle.
Jedi may not be George Lucas's crown jewel, but his trilogy as a whole is as good as film fantasy gets.	Mark Hamill is particularly good in this film.	Ewok-filled finale less Force-ful than previous.	Unfortunately, it conveys the sense that the machinery has already started to wear down, and the inventiveness to wear thin.	Even a lesser Star Wars movie has a lot to offer visually.	Though failing to reach the cinematic heights of its predecessors, Return of the Jedi remains an entertaining sci-fi adventure and a fitting end to the classic trilogy.
Michael Apted's Amazing Grace is a beautifully chiseled blunt instrument. No, it's not subtle, but how subtle was slavery?	It is to be hoped that Amazing Grace is not the only, or the last, cinematic celebration of 200th anniversary of abolition, for there are more stories to tell, more imaginatively.	As a period piece, it's remarkably detailed, smartly written, and likably acted.	Earnest, respectful and thoroughly dull, Michael Apted's Amazing Grace follows all of the worst traditions of British historical dramas.	Grufudd is fine, passionate and single-minded, though overly Romantic, and quietly upstaged by the extraordinary Benedict Cumberbatch.	Amazing Grace is your quintessential historical biopic: stately, noble, and with plenty of electrifying performances.
Music is fantabulous, acting solid, animation dynamic -- from cute to powerful in 0.5 seconds. This is what going to the movies is all about -- and I don't even have kids!	The long march across the Antarctic wasteland ... sometimes feels just as arduous as the real thing.	...ends up in an Orwellian nightmare involving scientists and a zoo (the tots at the preview screening went silent, either out of confusion or horror).	despite... shortcomings, "Happy Feet" brings a lot of energy and creativity to a genre that increasingly relies on slapstick and over-stimulation.	The film tries to do way too much: it's a mess. But, crude misjudgments aside, it's a tremendously entertaining mess.	Visually dazzling, with a thoughtful storyline and catchy musical numbers, Happy Feet marks a successful animated debut from the makers of Babe.
A solid, informative piece, but not a revelatory one. And if you should go see it, it's probably a good idea to pay at the boxoffice with cash rather than via a credit card.	Uma anбlise detalhada e preocupante sobre a polнtica empregada pelas operadoras de cartхes de crйdito no intuito de manterem os clientes numa situaзгo de endividamento constante - ou melh... pior: crescente.	...the film will make you think twice about spending money you don't have.	Has some sweet touches that make its very bitter medicine a little more palatable: humorously ironic educational film snips and some brutally honest interview subjects. Still, it's hard to watch it and not walk out angry at someone.	One of the most effective of the many recent agitprop documentaries.	Maxed Out's presentation of startling facts and candid interviews put a human face on the issue of debt and financial insecurity.
Extremely clever filmmaking--sharp and very funny, but also challenging and packed with relevance.	Live television going down in flames is always good for a laugh.	A deadpan delight that offers further proof of Romania's cinematic ascendance.	A deadpan comedy that evolves into a wry, politicized examination of truth.	The most hilarious movie I've seen this year.	With a witty script full of satirical overtones and dry humor, 12:08 East of Bucharest is a thoroughly enjoyable Romanian comedy.
While meticulously drawn, the film's characters are so stereotypically representative that only the lamest of moviegoers will not determine their respective backgrounds and problems long before the plodding movie does.	Who would have thought that the John Hughes classic The Breakfast Club would still be Hollywood's best attempt at understanding and then destroying stereotypes?	One of the few teen-oriented films that truly addresses the troubles of its characters, yet it falters in dealing with the issues raised.	It's extremely insightful, and pure fun all the way. There might be better movies, but few are as cool as this one.	Rarely have on-screen teens felt this authentic. They bluster, bicker and trade horrible insults (whence the film's R rating), then suddenly expose their most guarded feelings.	The Breakfast Club is a warm, insightful, and very funny look into the inner lives of teenagers.
A halfway decent editor could easily chop this down to 30 minutes without losing any plot points, but it would still be a tedious slog.	Stick to vampires, Buffy.	The Return doesn't have enough scares to be a good thriller, and it doesn't have the depth to work on an arty level. This isn't a bad movie; it's just painfully thin.	She gulps a hell of a lot, her cardigan sleeves are pulled down over her hands and her forehead's slightly furrowed (not too much, mind, it could make her look old). It can only mean one thing: Sarah Michelle Gellar is acting.	It's gripping stuff and deeply enjoyable.	Unoriginality may be an acceptable risk in the Horror genre, but boredom is never okay.
Cornball dialogue and poor characterizations drag down the successes of the incredible visual effects.	Green Lantern is reminiscent of 2008's The Incredible Hulk, another superhero flick that boasted a strong cast but went overboard on visual stimuli.	Before Hal Jordan's big-screen debut, I'd never heard of the guy. And now, having sat through the confused mess that is Green Lantern, I don't mind if I never hear of him again.	Watching this overproduced movie, which is devoid of real plot or characters, is like spending a day in amusement park, taking rides that vary in excitement, at the end of which you feel saturated and exhausted.	I've always considered DC's Green Lantern to be one step too far over the line into "come on, that's just silly" territory. (Fresh, but only just)	Noisy, overproduced, and thinly written, Green Lantern squanders an impressive budget and decades of comics mythology.
Harrison Ford is always watchable in this otherwise routine tear-jerker.	Vaughan and scriptwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs have plumped for the â~one man against all oddsâ(TM) plotline, the most reassuringly inoffensive of narrative archetypes.	Where the film takes off is in the complex pas de deux conducted by Crowley [Brendan Fraser] and Stonehill [Harrison Ford], whose goals overlap but are not identical.	If I was crying when the lights came up, it was only because no one had yet found a cure for the common TV movie.	There are lots of good reasons to grumble at this overearnest melodrama...	Despite a timely topic and a pair of heavyweight leads, Extraordinary Measures never feels like much more than a made-for-TV tearjerker.
It's rather like the favorite pastime of this movie's villain ... throwing wild dogs into a pit and watching them fight until there's only one left standing.	As wanker movies go then, Snatch is shrewd and entertaining.	Eccentric characters, lively banter, adults only.	Ritchie's command of the visual medium is so skillful, his criminals so memorable and his writing so undeniably entertaining, that it's a wasted criticism to try and intellectually dissect [his] movies.	The kind of moronic, blood-soaked exercise in nihilism that might have felt fresh 25 years ago if accompanied by a score of Sex Pistols music, but now is stale and moldy in its excesses.	Though perhaps a case of style over substance, Guy Ritchie's second crime caper is full of snappy dialogue, dark comedy, and interesting characters.
Helen's view of life and sex may be unusual, but it's far healthier -- if that word has any meaning -- than, say, the pseudo-philosophy of Lars von Trier's joyless Nymphomaniac.	Dank with the effluvia of a proudly unhygienic, sex-obsessed German teen, this frenetic adaptation of Charlotte Roche's notorious 2008 best-seller is a standing dare to anyone who thinks the movies have gotten too tame.	The weak of stomach will want to steer far away but those made of sterner stuff will find this to be the sweetest comedy about an anal fissure they've ever seen.	Shocking and outrageous -- but in the best way possible.	"Wetlands" is more than just a film that shares far more about anal fissures than you ever wanted to know, it's a surprisingly sweet coming-of-age comedy brimming with punk-rock energy and an impressive performance from Swiss actress Carla Juri.	While certainly not for the faint of heart, Wetlands transcends its shock value with sweetness, heart, and subversive wit.
Gratuitous in every sense of the word.	The suspense is as skimpy as the swimwear...	Take a look at the Piranha 3D poster or watch the trailer online. You'll know by the end if you want to see it and if you do, then you'll have a blast.	Hands down and body parts floating, the most irresistibly sick movie in years is Piranha 3D, which should be retitled Piranha 3D, Double-D and C for all the topless cuties director Alexandre Aja feeds the fish and audience.	There?s a dull predictability to the set pieces; when you see a topless para-skier bob in-and-out of the water, it?s inevitable that she?ll rise into the air without any legs.	Playing exactly to expectations for a movie about killer fish run amok, Piranha 3-D dishes out gore, guffaws and gratuitous nudity with equal glee.
A stunning technical achievement.	A humanistic adventure film that's both rich with characterization and concussive cannon bursts, Master and Commander is, surprisingly, some of the best work either Crowe or Weir have ever done.	It's an adventure movie by an artist.	The film shows how wonderful it is to be a Hollywood Captain instead of a real captain.	With its moving exploration of billowy battles and the men that fight them it's an epic film that looks every inch the spectacle it aims to be.	Russell Crowe's rough charm is put to good use in this masterful adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's novel.
Jonze's inventive approach to Maurice Sendak's classic children's book continually confounds our expectations with an approach that's so offhanded and fresh that it might feel awkward or strange. But it's a real grower.	It moves smoothly from the sublime to the ridiculous, it inhabits the dual worlds of fantasy and reality, and articulates something profoundly simple about both.	With a rebellious youth and angry behavior by sinister characters there is nothing uplifting for kids or adults.	You aren't likely to find a more eclectic group of actors providing the voices.	Maurice Sendak's spare, poetic, and deeply wise book has been lovingly unfolded into a movie about the child -- and the wild things -- who live in all of us.	Some may find its dark tone and slender narrative off-putting, but Spike Jonze's heartfelt adaptation of the classic children's book is as beautiful as it is uncompromising.
For me it captures Maddin at his loopiest and most inspired.	Puppy love and adult lust converge in Madden's grainy, humor-ridden "silent movie" that will certainly leave a brand upon your little brain.	You feel like you've stumbled across a lost treasure from some studio's vaults that was meant to be buried forever.	You don't want to miss one frenzied minute of it.	An expressionist journey with the best, most shadowy sets, the most outrageous inventions and the most horrific childhood memories ever seen in a lighthouse or an orphanage, let alone both.	A bizarre, compelling spectacle that invests its absurd plot with heartfelt sincerety, Brand Upon the Brain! is a unique cinematic experience.
The film is serious and thoughtful but not overwrought.	Full of acute observations about the social changes and economic divisions that are present not just within the neighborhood but the cousins' own families.	It may be ill-advised to admit that by the last frame, tears filled my eyes. To fulfill my obligation to avoid spoilers, however, I just won't say why.	The resolution to the girl's problem is a mite tidy, but the movie does a good job of capturing how ostracism and liberation are sides of the same spinning coin.	Sweet, formulaic and forgettable.	This slice-of-life story of a teenage girl in Echo Park is both a sweet crowd-pleaser and a perceptive look at socioeconomic community issues.
Though not as transcendent as director Satoshi Kon's previous project, the spectacular Millennium Actress, this expertly animated Godfathers still makes you an offer you can't refuse.	An anime movie made for people who don't necessarily like anime.	It's a touching movie that, like the best animes, transcends the limitations of the genre.	The greatest danger for Tokyo Godfathers is that it's read as drama when, in fact, it's a gentle, often delightful, slapstick comedy.	One of the most moving, enjoyable and wholly unconventional Christmas stories to come along in a long time.	Beautiful and substantive, Tokyo Godfathers adds a moving -- and somewhat unconventional -- entry to the animated Christmas canon.
The Look of Silence is one facet of perhaps the most important documentary project of the 21st century. Moving, sublime, and astonishing, this is a film for the ages and one not to be missed.	As the title indicates, this follow-up is dealing with a somewhat blunter set of symbols than its predecessor. It's just as wrenching, though ...	A reminder that the architects of a massive tragedy remain present and unrepentant, the personification of the evil men do and a warning that it could happen again.	The Look of Silence is simpler but is powerful precisely because of that simplicity.	Joshua Oppenheimer's new documentary thrives on the kind of stuff you can't make up. That is, the awful kind.	The Look of Silence delivers a less shocking -- yet just as terribly compelling -- companion piece to Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing.
Diana's victories in Girlfight ultimately ring hollow, and it's artificial and nauseating to watch Adrian transform from a hopeful contender to a limp dishrag.	A bit of a lightweight.	The most striking aspect of Girlfight: Michelle Rodriguez.	Much credit has to go to Rodriguez, Kusama's surly but charismatic lead.	One of this year's most fresh and exhilarating movies.	Michelle Rodriguez gives a compelling performance, despite lack of a boxing background; Karyn Kusama packs a punch with this directorial debut.
Succesfully playing a zombie onstage doesn't take the place of a few basic courses in Film School.	Loud, fast, derivative, and hypnotic...if there are two things that [Rob Zombie] is all about, it's horror movies and the art of the spectacle...campy and often funny	Unintentionally comical like a bad '70s slasher flick, but also enthralling in a circus freak show sort of way.	Le réalisateur cite abondamment, mais ne parvient jamais ŕ donner un sens ŕ ses élans qui finissent par s'éparpiller dans un fourre-tout incohérent et anormalement tapageur	House of 1000 Corpses isn't coherent, exactly, but what dripping-ghoul horror movie is these days?	There's an abundance of gore in this derivative horror movie, but little sense or wit.
Watching Seyfried come into her own as an actress going toe-to-toe with a powerhouse like Julianne Moore is thoroughly satisfying.	A tantalising thriller with explicit sexual content, the film is also a love story, made not so simple by the florid set up and narrative	Chloe descends into a preposterous third act that, by any measure, qualifies as a disaster. But it's proof of Egoyan's skill that the film works for as long as it does.	It looks like a cerebral director and hard-working cast trying to treat a piece of trash much more seriously than it deserves.	Hiring a hooker to entrap your husband makes for good entertainment.	Despite its promising pedigree and a titillating premise, Chloe ultimately fails to deliver the heat -- or the thrills -- expected of a sexual thriller.
Ricky Gervais and mainstream Hollywood rom-com are initially uneasy bedfellows but ultimately, and largely due to co-star Téa Leoni, it's a match made in its star's brand of comic purgatory.	Leoni and Gervais are wonderful together, as much for the ways in which they wobble against each other as for the ways they ultimately mesh.	After a trying week in which many of us suffered damage to our homes and others were still without power, Ghost Town will provide a wonderful boost, if just for a couple of hours.	Despite the high-concept premise, Ghost Town has a low-concept feel. The jokes are small, sly and sometimes gentle.	Ricky Gervais is such an unlikable misanthrope that this clumsy attempt at a redemptive comedy is as antipathetic as Gervais.	Ricky Gervais' consistently sharp performance and beautifully dry execution transform this otherwise mainstream comedy into an endearing, funny, and altogether snappy romantic comedy. With ghosts.
Clint Eastwood is the ultimate thinking man's cinematic killing machine.	Eastwood holds fast to the rebel spirit of the spaghetti Westerns and revisionist "New Hollywood" Westerns of the previous decade, but packages it in a film that's slicker and more mainstream-friendly.	A funny, brutal, scary movie, daringly surreal in its mix of Western and horror themes.	As a director, Eastwood is not as good as he seems to think he is. As an actor, he is probably better than he allows himself to be.	This film is hardcore. Not hardcore as in lots of blood and guts, but more in that it's just plain nasty. Everyone therein is nasty, and the hero is the nastiest man in the flick.	Clint Eastwood's sophomore outing as director sees him back in the saddle as a mysterious stranger, as the result is one of his most memorable Westerns.
Rather than turn the camera away when disaster strikes, [director Cassavetes] keeps his suffering characters in close, uninterrupted focus, pushing us squarely into their pain.	Alpha Dog may be more crass exploitation than an earnest attempt at laying out the facts of a crime, but it's exciting and watchable for anyone willing to romp in the mud for two hours.	Cassavetes starts to lose the plot at the precise moment he starts keeping exact track of it.	What starts off as another seeming teenboy-targeted flick celebrating would-be gangbangers becomes a more interesting docudrama about a kidnapping turned tragic in Nick Cassavetes's Alpha Dog.	A well-researched model of the true-crime genre...[and] close cinematic relative of Larry Clark's Bully.	A glossy yet unflinching portrait of violent, hedonistic teenagers. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone chew the scenery, while Justin Timberlake gives a noteworthy performance.
The movie deserves its advance cult status because of its antic humor and, of course, Campbell's Elvis.	a smart comedy that dares to take on the sublime and the ridiculous, succeeding on both counts with equal aplomb	May Bubba Ho-Tep play at midnight drive-ins until Elvis indeed returns.	Writer-director Don Coscarelli piles on unpleasant details and cynical asides as if they were the stuff of wisdom, though they seem intended to produce guffaws rather than thoughts	It has the damnedest ingratiating way of making us sit there and grin at its harebrained audacity, laugh at its outhouse humor, and be somewhat moved (not deeply, but somewhat) at the poignancy of these two old men and their situation.	The best movie to star both the King and JFK.
Unconvincing performances and overwritten dialogue make Woman fail to resonate.	Although it makes no bones about preaching to the choir, Woman, Thou Art Loosed has enough force as a searing emotional drama to transcend religious boundaries.	For victims of abuse, watching this film may be a cathartic experience. For most moviegoers, it is, at its best, a sober look at a problem that is at last getting some of the attention it has always deserved.	A quality production that fully engages.	It sounds like a rather overt Christian message, but the film is actually more of a cautionary melodrama with religious sermons sprinkled in between the various scenes	While Woman is a little less heavy-handed than other message movies, it still feels like an After School Special.
If you've heard anything about this movie, from the floating film festival persiflage to the test and press screening whispers, you know one thing: it climaxes strangely.	Although the style amps the attractiveness of individual scenes, it undercuts believability across the whole.	Too often settles for standard B-movie contrivance, proving to disappointed ticket buyers the truth of this odd little movie's best line: 'Hollywood will f*** you when no one else will'.	Meticulously mounted with bravura filmmaking that technically serves well the noir crime yarn, but the text is emotionally hollow.	Despite genius-level contributions from cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond and art director Dante Ferretti, the handsome film is almost abusively murky, trafficking in difficult-to-follow plot manipulations, arbitrary twists and mumbled dialogue.	Though this ambitious noir crime-drama captures the atmosphere of its era, it suffers from subpar performances, a convoluted story, and the inevitable comparisons to other, more successful films of its genre.
The kind of sequel that should have gone directly to DVD shelves.	Picks up pretty terrifying momentum once the jungle snakes get an urge to chow down on these humans, even if everyone on the menu is on the lean side	Due to the film, one has peace of mind in learning that if a companion is swallowed by an anaconda, its digestive process takes so long that it won't eat you too soon.	Anacondas is not 'snakespeare' but it's got the right mix of horror, suspense and camp and it delivers exactly what it promises.	Folks, you'll know whether you want to see this movie or not by the title alone.	A cheesy monster B-movie.
...creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above...what could have been a melodramatic, Lifetime Channel-style anthology.	A stuffy bore, filled with amateurish psychological 'insights' that make it seem like a more-ambitious -- and infinitely more pretentious -- Lifetime channel cable movie.	Unlike many movies you'll see or have seen about the fairer sex, neither wallowing in Lifetime movie affirmations and morbidity nor batting its lashes with cutie-pie comedy.	Makes you feel like you're reading a great compendium of short stories in which vibrant images literally burst from the pages.	A movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection.	Uneven, but a keenly observed and well-acted film about three women's lives.
If there's a real person in all this, he is lost in your stubbornly experimental filmmaking technique. Experiments are only interesting when they work, you know.	Wandering in a narcoleptic stupor, Pitt's junkie rock star is as much lost soul as tortured genius, and Van Sant refrains from tacky pop theorising or tired rock-crit veneration.	Van Sant hasn't found a means of deepening the premise he initially establishes, and his film bores and irritates rather than entrancing us as its predecessors did.	Last Days offers some insight into Cobain's final frame of mind, but balks at the gates of deeper truth.	Unpleasant but hypnotic lyrical meditation on death that was inspired by the suicide in 1994 of grunge rocker Kurt Cobain.	While the minimalist style is not for all viewers, those who prefer experimentalism will find Last Days hypnotic.
James Whale's extravagantly produced sequel to his own Frankenstein still ranks as one of horrordom's greatest achievements.	Absolute classic horror, the best of the 'Frankensteins.'	Grand, spectacular entertainment: a blend of horror and black comedy carried along by Whale's unique combination of theater and cinematic fireworks.	Seen today, Whale's masterpiece is more surprising than when it was made because today's audiences are more alert to its buried hints of homosexuality, necrophilia and sacrilege. But you don't have to deconstruct it to enjoy it.	Whale's most perfectly realised movie, a delight from start to finish.	An eccentric, campy, technically impressive, and frightening picture, James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein has aged remarkably well.
Let's not sell Tyler Perry short. As the vinegar-witted Madea, he's a drag performer of testy charm, but in his overlit patchwork way he's also making the most primal women's pictures since Joan Crawford flexed her shoulder pads.	The dysfunctional script and operatically excessive direction ... land someplace closer to outsider art than bad moviedom.	Perry's vaudevillian shamelessness and indifference to committee-approved taste are energizing and frequently jaw-dropping.	All the while Madea's wit, which is refreshing on the stage, feels spurious and often misfires.	Both of the villains are so far over the top they should be in the summer Olympics.	Tyler Perry's Madea's Family Reunion is sincere in its positive intentions, but leaves something to be desired as a film.
Black has finally got the hipness that his Lethal Weapon films pawed like apes, thudding with macho humor.	I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time.	This is about as lowbrow and raunchy as any filmmaker will ever get with an R rating.	The plot of the film is almost willfully convoluted. But it's also largely beside the point, an excuse for quite a few good scenes, most of them equal parts homage and subversion.	The best movie, with the best script, in writer Shane Black's career.	Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and spot-on performances in this dark, eclectic neo-noir homage.
The Business of Being Born is not overtly political. Its feminism is palpable but unspoken.	[It's] so selective in its presentation of information that it makes Michael Moore look like a fat lady in a blindfold holding a pair of scales.	Former talk show host Ricki Lake had her first baby in a hospital and came away with the need for a birth experience that was more empowering, with less medical intervention.	[Director] Epstein's opinion on the issue is never in doubt and once the attitude of the film is established, it seems to make the same points repeatedly. Fortunately, Epstein herself gets pregnant, and she gets to test her own theories.	As issue docs go, The Business Of Being Born is about as well-put-together and non-aggravating as the genre can get -- which isn't saying much, but it's still a small victory.	Epstein's argument in favor of home birthing is certainly biased -- but its biases are so transparent, and so impassioned, that they work in the film's favor.
From the title on down, Looney Tunes: Back in Action feels less like a movie than an exercise in brand reinforcement.	While the affection for the originals is really refreshing, Looney Tunes: Back in Action still stumbles over some formidable hurdles.	It's probably best to chalk this zany mess up to a case of too many conflicting ideas and no strong overarching vision.	Probably works best if you are into following the logic of cartoons.	Live action/animated tale will amuse cartoon fans.	The plot is a nonsensical, hyperactive jumble and the gags are relatively uninspired compared to the classic Looney Tunes cartoons.
Kevin Macdonald's State of Play has, in fact, everything you need to tell a great journalist's story, except a great story.	The three screenwriters may have been trying to work too many plot strands into two hours; in any case, State of Play is both overstuffed and inconclusive.	An homage to investigative reporting with Crowe playing a likable protagonist whose methods will be seen by some as virtuously dogged and others as unequivocally unethical	State of Play succeeds as mainstream entertainment to the point where it hardly makes sense to complain about its pulled political punches.	For a handy compare-and-contrast, check out the small- and big-screen versions of State of Play. You'll see the difference between a vital work of popular art and a patched-up retread.	A taut, well-acted political thriller, State of Play overcomes some unsubtle plot twists with an intelligent script and swift direction.
Intriguing family story of the sunny and dark sides of extreme home-schooling by surfing, through a trove of photos, home movies, and reminiscences, but little insight.	Some documentarians think like essayists, propagandists, abstract painters, or magazine reporters. Doug Pray approaches his documentaries as though he's writing books.	A doctor who does not care about money or status? Must be one-of-a-kind, and this documentary does him justice.	An honest look at a complicated human situation,... it turns out to be a darker film than might be expected.	The most fascinating parts of the movie explore how the Paskowitz children -- who are now in their 30s and 40s -- continue to adjust to a more 'normal' lifestyle.	An intriguing account of a unique family.
It is more op-ed than movie.	The long-winded speeches were made tolerable by the superb acting, but I got the point long before the speeches were over. I would have liked more of Luke and Pena. Still, Meryl Streep could easily grab a nomination. Meryl never whimpers - she roars.	Lions for Lambs is worth seeing for no other reason that you've never seen anything like it before. It's political theatre that shouldn't be missed.	Lions for Lambs simply isn't fresh or courageous enough to make an impact let alone a difference.	Like many a Hollywood political drama, Lions for Lambs carries a full head of steam that is indistinguishable from a lot of hot air.	Despite its powerhouse cast, Lions for Lambs feels like a disjointed series of lectures, rather than a sharp narrative, and ends up falling flat.
Don't even expect coherence.	When cascading through the cityscape, Spider-Man 3 still makes us gasp with delight, but on Earth those gasps come solely in reaction to the cynical dreariness of the script.	It's a towering disappointment.	As the Goblin and Sandman and whatnot multiply and start whizzing about, the proceedings in this grand hodgepodge are so disordered that it would be no surprise were a Nazg? wing into the scene, perhaps ridden by Dr. Zaius.	Spider-Man 3 is an 'almost' success...it 'almost' has us convinced that this trilogy will transcend its blockbuster necessities to mean something more - either as art, precedent, or simply a great way to spend some time at the Cineplex.	Though there are more characters and plotlines, and the action sequences still dazzle, Spider-Man 3 nonetheless isn't quite as refined as the first two.
I would like to declare a temporary moratorium on movies where people don't know things, feel like someone's following them, think they see dead people, or...	Few films have title more deserving.	'The Forgotten' deserves to be.	Moore's strength as an actor lifts this film above itself and makes it a fun and exciting ride, as long as you don't know anything going into it.	It's amazing the acting talent assembled for this mess.	The premise grows too ridiculous to take seriously.
After the predictably generic first 40 minutes, the movie turns into an unexpected magical journey that was moving in the way we expect Pixar movies to be.	A film that starts off big and promising but diminishes into a rather wee thing as it chugs along, with climactic drama that is both too conveniently wrapped up and hinges on magical elements that are somewhat confusing to boot.	Brave is stock Disney storytelling dressed up with Pixar majesty.	Yes, little kids, especially the undemanding ones, will probably like it but if they were pressed to choose between the two, my guess is that most of them would voice a preference for "Madagascar 3." Strangely enough, so would I.	Cockamamie folklore from a land too distant for Hollywood digimators to strain themselves over authenticity.	Brave offers young audiences and fairy tale fans a rousing, funny fantasy adventure with a distaff twist and surprising depth.
Sharif gives a wonderfully understated performance . . .a half-smile, a pursed lip, fills the screen with the warm glow of emotions deeply felt and expertly rendered.	[Sharif] imbues this seemingly simple man with the wisdom that age brings the lucky ones -- his Ibrahim is a subdued Zorba the Greek.	Anchored by two superb performances, the film becomes slightly more engaging than it has any right to.	Excusez-moi, but I'd rather see Omar Sharif punching out croupiers in a casino than dispensing comfort and joy in this sugared-up tale.	Omar Sharif reclaims his place on the big screen with a career award in Venice, a leading role in Hidalgo and this charming French drama.	With tender, assured performances, Sharif and Boulanger elevate what might have been a rote coming-of-age tale.
[Marston] allows the extraordinary Moreno, also making her debut, to carry all the uncertainty, terror and pain on her own young, striking shoulders.	Jim Denault's subtle, handheld cinematography makes clear Maria's perspective without overstating what's obvious: she's in crisis.	The unalloyed earnestness with which Marston tells his story, the frankness of that story and the insistently powerful performance of Catalina Sandino Moreno make Maria one of the more noteworthy debuts in recent filmmaking.	A gripping, deeply moving film.	Throughout, we're constantly rooting for Maria, aware of her underlying decency and protective of her missteps.	In a striking debut, Moreno carries the movie and puts a human face on the drug trade.
Nowhere near as vulgar as most contemporary teen comedies...On the other hand, it's a crushing bore. At least Nia Vardalos' terrible I Hate Valentine's Day had the right verb in its title.	The woefully unfunny I Love You, Beth Cooper is a teen sex comedy's worst enemy.	The writer of I Love You, Beth Cooper says the story is based on a dream. I believe him. This is one of the very few movies where I wanted the hero to wake up and discover it was only a dream.	The story is timeless; this could have taken place when [screenwriter] Doyle graduated in '76 -- or any year, really, since the effects of high school linger throughout adult life and nerds are forever.	There's not one remotely funny thing about this movie, except for maybe the fact that the filmmakers are trying to pass off Rust as a teen.	Heavily reliant on stereotypes and shallow teen comedy clichés, I Love You Beth Cooper is a humorless affair that fails to capture the charm of its source novel.
Sputnik Mania is not riveting; but it is, first and last, informative.	So obsessed with delivering a story about "mania" through overcooked narrative and aesthetic means that one ultimately feels as manipulated as enlightened.	The reigning champion in the archival footage department features great Soviet footage of those days that (hopefully) will never be seen again---the days of the US-Soviet space race.	Surprising, Insightful, Informative. We are reminded that an "atmosphere" of fear may be much more dangerous than the threat.	reminds us that there was a time in the past when world leaders had morality and values	Featuring riveting footage, Sputnik Mania is an informative, well-made piece that effectively captures the mood during the height of the Cold War.
Every frame of Old Joy bespeaks a yearning for a more user-friendly day, when gas was less than $2.50 a gallon and there was always a used record store to unload your scratched vinyl.	The movie explores the increasingly coarse line between nostalgia and acceptance for the way things are, without exclamatory revelation and uproarious self-pity. It's Sideways for realists.	Old Joy may be built around a road trip, but it's also a movie about two roads -- and two souls -- diverging.	Old Joy is as dull and doomed as the men's friendship.	To my mind, there was a lot of wasted time -- repetitive shots of scenery from a moving car that felt more like padding than "atmosphere," as if the movie makers had to create a feature length for a project that just as easily and perhaps more effect	A serene, melancholy beauty permeates this meditative portrait of deep friendship and faded glory.
Shocking and effective but doesn't quite live up to all the hype.	All in all, Basic Instinct is a film that should be viewed as nothing more than a good example of Hollywood craftsmanship.	Trailer trash Hitchcock spliced with overboiled film noir.	Call me a prude, but it's not sexy watching an erotic thriller in which every time a couple does it, one of them gets it with an ice pick. I don't care how many firmly toned tummies and tushes are bared.	The film's problems begin with its story, which is constructed with relentless manipulation in mind. It never plays fair with the audience.	Unevenly echoing the work of Alfred Hitchcock, Basic Instinct contains a star-making performance from Sharon Stone but is ultimately undone by its problematic, overly lurid plot.
comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special, freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class. ...provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns.	Britney Spears and company are well aware that they're making nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of Spears' glossy bubble gum pop--but that's exactly the problem.	It is bad, but certainly not without merit as entertainment.	An example of shamelessly bad screenwriting, laden with coincidence and cliché and empty characterizations.	Tends to pile too many "serious issues" on its plate at times, yet remains fairly light, always entertaining, and smartly written.	A cliched and silly pop star vanity project, Crossroads is strictly for Britney fans only.
Dinner and a DreamWork	Hanks' perfectly rendered Navorski offsets the hogwash and makes the film's shortcomings bearable.	Sweet but disjointed film.	Cloying and contrived.	The Terminal isn't a belly laugh or a knee-slapper; rather it enthralls viewers with gentle humor and warmth and holds your attention with the mystery of Viktor's visit.	Tom Hanks and the rest of the amiable cast make this bumpy ride worth sitting through.
An interesting experiment in tone and narrative that, while getting the job done, definitely fails to fulfill the promise of the premise.	Conviction is the kind of more-bland-than-truly-bad Oscar bait that, to its credit, displays genuine affection for its characters.	Based on a limp script that holds more padding and melodrama than genuine tension, it all feels like one big wasted opportunity.	A well-meaning drama that contains absolutely zero surprises. As a film that got a lot of early mentions for Oscar contention, there's no denying Conviction registers as a disappointment.	Tony Goldwyn directed a cast that ranges from the excellent (Minnie Driver as a fellow attorney, Melissa Leo as a crooked cop) to the laughable (Juliette Lewis as a trashy woman whose perjured testimony helps put the brother away).	Less compelling -- and more manipulative -- than it should be, Conviction benefits from its compelling true story and a pair of solid performances from Swank and Rockwell.
Piglet's Big Movie is an agreeable, if fitfully entertaining, introduction to Milne's characters. But it's no substitute for going by the book.	Screenwriter Brian Hohlfeld imbues the animals with the easily recognizable foibles and insecurities that have made Milne's stories (and the films adapted from them) so endearing through the generations.	The screenplay by Brian Hohlfeld incorporates three of the original Pooh stories but captures none of the charm of A.A. Milne's droll voice.	A pint-sized delight, combining high-quality (but traditional-looking) animation, a sweet story and an excellent batch of Carly Simon songs.	If you've got some very small fry on your hands and 75 minutes to kill, this is as bright, colorful, and fuzzy as you're going to get.	Wholesome and charming entertainment for young children.
Simply Madagascar through the Disney blender.	The animation here impresses more than in the equally defunct Madagascar, but everything else smacks of an easy money-making exercise of such dimwitted inanity even the youngest kids will see through it.	Gags consistently trump character. And if you don't care about the characters, then everything's just a big, dumb joke.	The digitally animated The Wild is an undemanding and unremarkable effort like Madagascar, which beat it to the screen with a similar theme.	Impressive animation, but too much déjŕ vu here.	With a rehashed plot and unimpressive animation, there's nothing wild about The Wild.
Myers and Roach are running dangerously close to empty as far as new and genuinely funny ideas, and they would be best off quitting before they fall any farther behind.	With so many impersonations to keep track off, director Jay Roach winds up moving between Myers and Myers so often that the editing feels like a crude cut-and-paste job.	This third Austin Powers adventure deserves to be his last.	The video companion for 'The Complete Idiot's Guide to Movie Sequels.'	Era mais engraçado quando [Mike] Myers ria dos outros, e năo de si mesmo.	While the narrative structure is messy and doesn't make much sense, the third installment of the Austin Powers franchise contains enough inspired bits to entertain.
Bernstein's score is remarkably resilient, and the plot and characters are obviously timeless.	Demonstrates yet again the enduring quality of Shakespeare's work.	The memorable sequences will stay with you after, but the mediocre and prosaic are mood-altering and too close in contiguity.	A beautiful blend of inventive staging, great music and gritty story.	Technically stunning, with dazzling choreography matching an unforgettable score.	Buoyed by Robert Wise's dazzling direction, Leonard Bernstein's score, and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics, West Side Story remains perhaps the most iconic of all the Shakespeare adaptations to visit the big screen.
It's a hearty, thoughtful, smartly assembled, vaguely complete documentary about a rock band that, even by the standards of out-there musical acts, seemed out there both in the mid-1980s and even now.	Desperately seeking the key of we	Directors Chris Metzler and Lev Anderson seem to have considered several different approaches for their film and settled on all of them.	The group's influence - attested to by members of No Doubt, the Peppers and Jane's Addiction, among many others - is indisputable.	To hear the soaring craziness of Fishbone's "Sunless Saturday" is to wonder how such musical inspiration could possibly miss.	Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone is an entertaining, heartwarming, and balanced documentary about the influential Los Angeles band.
[Herzog] simply means to show us things as they are - and in this corner of Texas, just north of Houston, things are undeniably violent. And mean.	Herzog asks, in that probing yet gentle, meditative voice we've come to cherish, "What does it mean?" Oh, Werner. We don't ask such things in 'Merica.	An egalitarian study of crime and punishment in a small Southern town, Into the Abyss is also an unmistakably Herzogian inquiry into the lawlessness of the human soul.	This is the abyss the film shows, the frightening arbitrariness of the death penalty. People are born into poverty and violence by chance, and their fates -- as crime victims or victims of the state -- are also functions of chance.	An inquiry into fundamental moral, philosophical, and religious issues, and an examination of humankind's capacity for violence - individual and institutional.	Another probing, insightful look at an interesting subject, Werner Herzog explores the American prison system with passion and not politics.
"Finding Neverland" is full of wit, emotion, adventure, and mystery that will inspire all ages to come see why and how Peter Pan was born.	Twee is one of those distinctly English words. It's used to describe something flowery, fey, hopelessly lightweight. It can also be applied -- quite nicely, thank you -- to Finding Neverland.	Self-conscious toniness and message-mongering are the undoing of Neverland, which finds itself only sporadically.	The film is whimsical, but it lacks dramatic punch.	You're expected to weep, and perhaps you will weep. But if you do, it's not likely that you'll respect yourself in the morning.	It won't pass muster for those looking for historical accuracy, but Finding Neverland is a warm, heartfelt drama with a charm all its own -- and Johnny Depp gives a graceful performance as Peter Pan creator J.M. Barrie.
Call it the Robert Downey Jr. Meets Sherlock Holmes Effect. A classic popular adventure gets overblown, juiced-up, and generally CGI-ified.	So dumb and goofy and ridiculous that it's actually kind of hard not to like on those terms.	It has more to do with trying to remake Pirates Of The Caribbean in France than with filming Dumas' novel.	Lively and bawdy retelling of the classic.	[L]eaden where it should be light... It is graceless and charmless. It reels from the painful banter. It is the epitome of empty soulless corporate filmmaking.	It plays admirably fast and loose with Alexandre Dumas' classic tale, but in every other respect, The Three Musketeers offers nothing to recommend -- or to set it apart from the many other film adaptations.
Garfield is a cool cat with attitude, yet his debut on the big screen falls short by more than a whisker largely due to a script that relies on novelty value rather than fresh ideas.	Those who get bored by the movie (i.e. everybody), can pass the time by counting the many product placements.	Il ne faut pas y chercher du grand cinéma mais rien de plus qu'un divertissement honnęte aussitôt oublié.	This isn't a movie, it's a marketing ploy.	The humor ranges from tame to neutered.	When the novelty of the CGI Garfield wears off, what's left is a simplistic kiddie movie.
Wimpy Kid's filmmakers have gone off-book, so to speak, to inflect Greg with a surprising cruel streak.	Overall, it's fast, funny, and effective and will probably please fans.	Rather than make you smile and delight once more in the joys of childhood, this thudding family offering leaves you with a headache.	I am giving this film four out of five stars because they made some changes to the storyline, but it is still awesome.	Funnier and faster than its charming predecessor.	Moderately witty and acceptably acted, Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2 isn't much worse than the first installment.
One of Hollywood's greatest comedies.	A delightful piece of utter absurdity and one of director Hawks' most inspired lampoons of the battle between the sexes.	Splendid screwball farce: You can't help but love this teaming	One of those movies that seems to improve upon repeat viewings.	Much like "Singin' In The Rain," "Bringing Up Baby" maintains a level of energy that is almost impossible to achieve. The story, the dialogue and the acting move so fast that one cannot help but get caught up in this 90-minute joke	With Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant at their effervescent best, Bringing Up Baby is a seamlessly assembled comedy with enduring appeal.
Of course, the thing doesn't actually die. It just folds up its face and hibernates for another 23 years, or at least until the inevitable Jeepers Creepers 3: More Goo for You.	A fright-free disaster that makes you long for the 80's glory days of straight-to-video horror.	Para compensar a falta de um roteiro, Victor Salva repete cada capotagem ou explosăo várias vezes, de ângulos diferentes. É como ver inúmeros replays em uma partida sem gols.	The nameless monster is akin to an unintentionally funny hybrid of Batman and a blowfish.	The Creeper is quite the compelling little devil; too bad he's realized amidst such familiar trappings and tiresome caricatures.	Jeepers Creepers 2 is competently made, but it doesn't have the scares of the original.
This complex and involving Argentinean crime drama, with strong moral overtones, won the Best Foreign Language Oscar.	A supremely watchable, well-made and well-acted movie with a dark, sinewy sense of history...	From scene to scene, the movie has an enormously vital swing to it.	This is far from a traditional murder mystery. The richness of the characterisations and depiction of the essence of who all the characters are, is one of the film's greatest strengths. Performances are utterly convincing	Gorgeously filmed with passion and artistry, this provocative story of the tenacity of justice ... is literally breathtaking filmmaking on every level	Unpredictable and rich with symbolism, this Argentinian murder mystery lives up to its Oscar with an engrossing plot, Juan Jose Campanella's assured direction, and mesmerizing performances from its cast.
A suspenseful, entertaining movie.	A delectable mélange of dark comedy, suspenseful melodrama and touching romance	It is Frears' sure directorial hand, along with some deft performances, that keeps Dirty Pretty Things from ever edging into the risible.	A suspense movie that works bracingly well as a genre thriller while also offering gems of social portraiture and a lacerating expose of current conditions among illegal London aliens.	Entertainingly unruly	An illuminating and nuanced film about the exploitation of illegal immigrants.
Each shot is layered with delicious meaning, like a wedding cake layered with frosting.	Smashing.	A well-crafted, strongly-acted film.	A potentially interesting idea deflated by the absurd proclamations of an arch screenplay and smothered under the ponderous gravity of M. Night Shyamalan's dreary direction.	Although the subject matter is fantastical, Shyamalan keeps it down to earth with moody realism and a refusal to overstate anything.	With a weaker ending, Unbreakable is not as a good as The Sixth Sense. However, it is a quietly suspenseful film that intrigues and engages, taking the audience through unpredictable twists and turns along the way.
Willmott's film is an inventive indie production, and a chilling look at a future America narrowly avoided.	...a profane joke that doesn't ruffle quite as many feathers as it should.	The satire comes to feel strained and the whole premise gets awfully precious, reducing social subtleties to cinematic simplicities.	If you've ever wondered what the course America history might have taken if the south had won the Civil War, you might like to check out this infinitely creative, alternately sobering and humorous look at America's lingering legacy of racism.	A rough-edged but incredibly provocative fake documentary.	Through the eyes of a British "documentary", this film takes a satirically humorous, and sometimes frightening, look at the history of an America where the South won the Civil War.
This comedy-drama is more of the formulaic, predictable and lightweight fluff [Moore's] been making all along.	The thoroughly unremarkable Chasing Liberty makes it three negligible movies in a row for Mandy Moore.	Chasing Liberty should have been called "How To Deal with Chasing Liberty While Remembering To Walk."	A formula romantic comedy designed for middle school girls and not of much interest or appeal for anyone else.	Forgettable fluff but it left me in an unaccountably bad mood, mainly because it's a step back for Mandy Moore.	Formulaic comfort food for the teen crowd.
This essential Billy Wilder film smoothly combines trenchant social observation with hilarious comedy.	[Lemmon's character is] a whingeing, self-pitying figure who, like other Wilder practitioners, cannot recognise the extent of his turpitude, and this is both the strength and weakness of a remarkable movie.	Humanism and cleverness age like fine wine, even if served with spaghetti strained with a tennis racket.	Directed by Wilder with attention to detail and emotional reticence that belie its inherent darkness and melodramatic core, it's lifted considerably by the performances.	In the canon of classics by famed writer/director Billy Wilder, this jewel of a comedy easily stands as one of his most beloved.	Director Billy Wilder's customary cynicism is leavened here by tender humor, romance, and genuine pathos.
Road Trip may not have the all-time-classic status of Animal House, but it's frequently as funny.	...genuinely funny...	Road Trip rides the wave of popularity for base, politically incorrect, outrageous humor.	[Tom] Green's brand of absurdist tongue-in-cheek humor informs much of Road Trip even when he isn't on screen. If you like his shtick, you'll probably enjoy the ride.	Road Trip is nothing more than a series of sight gags and put-downs. It's often funny, but it never has anything smart to say.	Some humor is hit or miss, depending on the audience tastes, but the movie is funny overall. Mixed reviews for the cast, especially for MTV's Tom Green.
Tango and Cash is a pale imitation of Lethal Weapon, but it works well enough to be entertaining.	Dreck and more dreck. A waste of celluloid. Almost makes one appreciate Judge Dredd.	Full of stupid A-Team-style action. A forerunner of today's braindead action films.	The film looks like the sort of queasy fever dream that might be produced by sitting through an entire Orson Welles film festival while eating pepperoni pizzas.	An awful, smug, monster truck of a movie.	Brutally violent and punishingly dull, this cookie-cutter buddy cop thriller isn't even fun enough to reach "so bad it's good" status.
You know you want that slushee in your face (in 3D), Gleeks!	Haters, head for the door. But Gleeks? Get your "Glee" on.	Glee leaps past antiseptic politeness or political correctness-it's got its crosshairs on self-acceptance and personal pride, and the film proves the agenda is working.	The Fox TV phenomenon is the Lewis & Clark of discovering new revenue streams. And this big-screen iteration is just as buoyant and bright-eyed as the rest of the franchise.	Here is the problem: If you separate these kids from their characters, if you remove their showtunes from the storylines that make them so dazzling in the fantasy-reality play of the series, then Glee is stripped of its core appeal.	The unconverted will remain just as perplexed as ever, but for gleeful Gleeks, The 3D Concert Movie delivers exactly what it promises.
Shutter the latest photographic enlargement of an Asian horror picture, is clearer and sharper than many of its predecessors, but even the most expert re-touching cannot obscure the fact that we have seen it all before.	Your soul will be intact after Shutter, but it will cost you 85 minutes.	Its PG-13 rating and basic lack of gore seem designed to be uncontroversial, but of course the result of all this anti-controversy is a really dull film.	Shutter coughs up another vengeful ghost in the form of a spurned Japanese waif who appears in photographs and sets about getting her message across as many ghosts do -- in the most indirect, passive-aggressive, logic-defying way imaginable	Really, what's the point? It's a business deal rather than a movie.	Being a remake of a Thai horror film instead of Japanese doesn't prevent Shutter from being another lame Asian horror remake.
Borat will make you laugh till it hurts, and you'll still beg for more.	I may never recover, but it's worth seeing. Just leave your sensibilities at home. .	Truly smart comedy is hard to come by these days, but Cohen has delivered a simultaneously uproarious and thought-provoking experience.	Put on two pairs of underwear and try to stay dry through one of the most uproariously -- or, in the case of the nude wrestling scene between Borat and his morbidly obese producer, disgustingly -- funny movies in a very long time.	Don't see Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan if you're easily offended by . . . never mind.	Jagshemash! Borat gets high-fives almost all-around for being offensive in the funniest possible way. Part satire, part shockumentary, Borat stars Sacha Baron Cohen as the gleefully sexist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic title character on a cross-country trek to learn more about our strange nation; along the way he dredges up the seamy underbelly of American prejudice and ignorance. Now the cat is out of the bag, what will Cohen do for an encore?
If you're a lover of quick dialogue and madcap situations, you'll likely feel this one came with a bow attached.	The bloody tale of a blocked scriptwriter and a bunch of gangsters is fun to watch (mostly), yet the bold twists and turns of its playful narrative seem to serve no greater purpose other than its own cleverness.	The really crazy thing about Seven Psychopaths is how much sense it makes, in a weird sort of way. And how much fun it has while doing so.	This is what Adaptation might've looked like had Charlie Kaufman been hired to pen a flippantly nihilistic wiseguy saga instead of an unfilmable ode to orchids.	Smart enough to work on multiple levels: as a witty salute to masculine '70s cinema...as a deconstruction of same...and as an existential consideration of the role of self-expression in ascribing meaning to life...	Seven Psychopaths delivers sly cinematic commentary while serving up a heaping helping of sharp dialogue and gleeful violence.
Suspension of disbelief is as necessary as popcorn when approaching a summer comic-book movie, but LXG is too preposterous even for this fantastical genre.	It could be introduced as Exhibit A in the case against digital effects technology...	Pretty shabby.	Casting a six-foot-two Shane West and having him play Tom Sawyer as a listless (but American!) hunk: that's bad.	The problem with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the filmmakers tried to give everyone a main storyline and ended up diluting everything.	Just ordinary. LXG is a great premise ruined by poor execution.
Evokes the quote, 'A liberal is a conservative that's been arrested.'	After Innocence is, without making it overly obvious, anti-death penalty on the grounds that a just society cannot afford to make any mistakes that we cannot attempt to rectify.	A strikingly varied collection of individual stories with a chilling common thread: the ease with which the criminal justice system can and does fail law-abiding, innocent Americans each and every day.	The scope of the problem, with likely thousands of innocent people incarcerated thanks mostly to errant eyewitness testimony, should give pause to anyone who thinks that life is as simple as black and white, innocent and guilty.	Each lost face in the documentary is a burning reminder of the human toll when our justice system succumbs to its imperfections.	This understated yet emotionally devastating documentary lets the stories of its subjects speak for themselves.
A League of Ordinary Gentlemen looks fondly back at an era when bowling was the most popular leisure activity in America.	The dork factor is cheerfully acknowledged by the hip documentary A League of Ordinary Gentlemen, a witty look at the sport's quest for cool.	A spunky documentary about the frantic efforts to resurrect the moribund sport of bowling.	The new and improved Tour now has a terrifically well-made and astute film documenting its birthing pains.	It's a curious movie, in the best sense, acknowledging that everybody is obsessed with something, then finding out why this particular group of people is obsessed with this particular pastime.	Even if bowling isn't your sport, this colorful documentary is still an entertaining watch.
The combination of the distant noises and the raw fear in the voices will throw a chill into anyone's blood.	If you can handle its unconventional approach, you won't feel as if you're seeing a film so much as witnessing a living nightmare.	It's what you don't see in The Blair Witch Project that scares you.	The Blair Witch Project taps into primitive beliefs about the supenatural in a way not tried before by traditional filmmakers.	The very crudeness of the film stock and technique contribute mightily to the feeling that things are out of control, disoriented and possibly subject to unnatural laws.	Full of creepy campfire scares, mock-doc The Blair Witch Project keeps audiences in the dark about its titular villain -- thus proving that imagination can be as scary as anything onscreen.
Matchstick Men ultimately plays its audience for the fool. And while the sting is well orchestrated and enjoyable, the effect is fleeting.	Both an offbeat character study and a tricky fable about con men, Matchstick Men should delight audiences with its engaging performances and genuinely unexpected surprises.	[Nicolas Cage] just makes you believe in him.	...a film that is genuine, sweet, strongly acted and well written at a time when such qualities are virtually nonexistent at the local multiplex.	[Matchstick Men] is what you get when a bunch of talented pros get together to make a movie without worrying about Oscar nominations, career moves and 10-Best lists. They're just having fun, and chances are, you will, too.	Breezy and well-acted, Matchstick Men focuses more on the characters than on the con.
I first saw it when I was 14 and thought it was one of the worst pictures ever -- garish, oppressive, and appallingly overacted. Grown up, I'd go with those same adjectives, except now I think it's one of the best.	One of a few monumental 1950s swan songs marking the end of the great epoch of traditional studio filmmaking.	Welles made the film that virtually capped a style he had helped create: you could say that the span of film noir started with Citizen Kane and ended with this movie.	The bravura of the opening sequence of Orson Welles's last Hollywood picture grabs you by the throat.	Do yourself a favour and catch Touch of Evil.	Artistically innovative and emotionally gripping, Orson Welles' classic noir is a visual treat, as well as a dark, sinister thriller.
Avoid this at all costs.	[L]ooks and sounds and feels as if it were... made by kids who'd broken into Dad's toolshed and borrowed his filmmaking toys.	Squinting through cardboard glasses you get at the door, you see washed-out colors, blurred images and not enough pop-out to merit the trade-off.	Based on characters created by Rodriguez's then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, the film doesn't belong in wide release. It belongs on a refrigerator door, alongside '100%' spelling tests, old lunch menus, and notices from the PTA.	Barely fresh...and then only for 10 year olds and younger.	The decision to turn this kiddie fantasy into a 3-D film was a miscalculation.
Brittany Murphy is a very complex woman. Her eyes say "take me," her roots say "color me," and her random facial spasms say "treat me for Parkinson's."	Hackneyed star-brite Brittany Murphy-Ashton Kutcher rom-com.	There are some movies that are good, there are some movies that are bad, and there are some movies that are made tolerable simply because the stars seem to be having fun. Just Married is all three.	Has about as much flow, timing, and inspirational humor as statistical research.	The cast must work overtime to overcome musty jokes that possess the unmistakable scent of a rented tuxedo.	Just Married's plot is predictable, and the overdone pratfalls get tiresome.
Filmgoers will enjoy their own insiders' look at the excess and at a fraction of the price.	It's the Wayans' reluctance to upset anyone that misses colliding class and value differences into real hilarity.	It goes places... bad places. Creepy, skin-crawling, 'no, mommy, not the clown suit' places. Places that chew at the subconscious and lurk in the hidden recesses of nightmare.	Scores more hits than misses.	[A] wildly uneven comedy that has some laughs but probably contains more flatulence jokes than any movie should ever need.	Scattershot comedy that's silly and obvious.
Bleak but beautifully rendered.	There's little room to see The Circle as anything but a way all Iranian women are kept as prisoners.	Devastatingly effective.	The surprising conclusion leaves one breathless and depressed.	An impressive piece of work, especially considering it was made in a barren artistic climate overseen by a censorious government.	Bleak, yet powerful, The Circle offers a searing indictment of the oppressive conditions experienced by women in Iran.
Circumstance is solidly constructed, but without much in the way of inspiration.	This impressive debut feature generates plenty of erotic heat, and Nikohl Boosheri, in her first screen role, gives a captivating performance as the sensually awakened heroine.	Circumstance is in many ways an impressive achievement. But its mix of documentary detail and melodramatic plotting ultimately tips toward the latter.	About a sexy, frank and politically contentious Iranian film, two things can be known for a certainty: (a) It sure wasn't made in Iran and (b) It won't be shown there either.	An engrossing Iranian film about the familial clash of values of a sister seeking freedom and pleasure and a brother who is zealot for Islamic fundamentalism.	A thought-provoking, insightful look into Iranian youth culture.
This is a profound movie for people who don't like to think, or perhaps for people who are in the media and of the media, and can't imagine any life outside it.	A deceptively simple fairy tale; a hilariously subversive satire… and finally an elegant parable about truth and happiness with evocative religious resonances.	The conception is so audacious and inventive that the movie winds up doing something genuinely radical: it bores through the boundaries of our entire media-saturated culture.	Carrey turns Truman into a postmodern Capra hero.	A little miracle of 1990s Hollywood that deserves more praise and more audience today than it had a few years ago.	A funny, tender, and thought-provoking film, The Truman Show is all the more noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives.
It's very powerful but disturbing stuff.	A methodically constructed, step-by-step detailing of how the Bush administration's policy of condoning torture trickled -- flowed, really; poured -- down the chain of command to inundate the largely untrained troops in the field.	Exhaustively researched and shattering documentary by Alex Gibney.	A shocking expose about the American military's use of torture to get confessions--not always truthful ones--from prisoners suspected of terrorism. This is the kind of film that can make a difference!	The usefully horrifying documentary Taxi to the Dark Side follows a map that leads to the notorious prison abuses in Iraq's Abu Ghraib to policies in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp.	Taxi to the Dark Side is an intelligent, powerful look into the dark corners of the War on Terror.
Through the performances and screenplay, we often do get some extremely well-written and intelligent scenes.	Focus on the regal, flawless Sarandon and remember 'tis the season for sap.	If your idea of holiday cheer includes a good cry, Stepmom might do.	A decently constructed dramatic piece that mainly succeeds simply because of what its great cast pours into it.	Beyond embarrassing!	Great performances from the leads can't save this factory mill tearjerker.
A dark rites-of-passage story meets lethal Shakespearean drama, with low-key performances that artfully get under the skin.	An extraordinarily tense, menacing film set in a Melbourne crime family in the recent past.	But honestly, the film is lame.	Animal Kingdom wrongly assumes certain characters deserve empathy simply because they're protagonists.	Michod gives us a conclusion that is simultaneously shocking, decisive and ambiguous; one that exemplifies the unsettling richness of the film.	With confident pacing, a smart script, and a top-notch cast, Animal Kingdom represents the best the Australian film industry has to offer.
We loved every minute of Tom's company and his film, right down to Halford's O Holy Night over the closing credits.	The result is at turns aggravating, pathetic and hilarious, a sort of This is Spinal Tap meets American Movie.	Both inspiring and profoundly entertaining.	Like a nonfiction Chris Farley movie...it's never less than entertaining, though not as the redemption story Tom Berninger probably thinks he's created.	The film is helplessly, or craftily, scatter-shaped. Molecules fly everywhere: bits of concert footage, bits of serious or This is Spinal Tap -ish interviews; bits - or lots - of Tom existentially imploding.	A suitably complicated look at fraternal bonds, Mistaken for Strangers offers more depth and insight than the usual tour documentary.
Cliché title, fun movie... a premium wire-fu fantasy.	An enjoyable big budget film with lots of fancy sets, special effects and great fight scenes.	The Forbidden Kingdom may be nothing but disposable fun, but it is a great, heaping, overflowing helping of fun. If you're 10, it may also seem like Citizen Kane.	The Jackie/Jet pairing lives up to the hype, resulting in one of the best family adventure tales of recent memory.	The film tries to contain the best of two worlds - exaggerated, cartoonish comedy and disconcertingly brutal violence. Like Chan and Li, the two philosophies grind uncomfortably beside each other.	This hotly-anticipated pairing of martial arts legends Jackie Chan and Jet Li features dazzling fight scenes but is weighed down by too much filler.
It's a bit too busy and precocious for its own good, but still has enough of a charming throwback quality that I was willing to forgive many of its flaws.	Perfectly captures the hubbub of the nation's newsrooms.	The characterizations, the eccentricities, the feverish sense of pursuing a deadline story and an awful lot of other particulars that show just how defiantly dedicated and frenetically frenzied the members of the fourth estate can be, are dead on.	A great ensemble cast	Incisively depicts the ways in which busyness, speed and constant pressure violate our souls in the workplace.	Fast and frenetic, The Paper captures the energy of the newsroom thanks to its cast and director on first-rate form.
Overrated at the time of release, the Oscar-winning Oliver! is a skillful but unexciting movie musical, one that softens considerably Dicken's famous novel, and not helped much by the mediocre staging of the production numbers.	Mistrust a movie with too many close-ups of Bisto Kid children and doleful dogs: they suggest a director cleverly boxing his way out of some very tight script corners.	It may be stylised and in some ways out of date, but the charm of Oliver will delight you over and over again.	Handsome, moving version of famed musical	Reed's memorable and epic musical provides good family fun, some great musical numbers and in Fagin, the Artful Dodger, and Sykes, some of cinema's most beloved unsavoury characters.	It has aged somewhat awkwardly, but the performances are inspired, the songs are memorable, and the film is undeniably influential.
After a summer of far too many loud, but ultimately empty superhero films, Nebraska is a blessed relief.	Mr. Nelson's observant, detailed script flawlessly captures the mood of what American ennui has done to both old and young men on their way to becoming losers, lending a look and feel that seems like the Great Depression.	A wistful ode to small-town Midwestern life and the quixotic dreams of stubborn old men.	The film features a number of superb acting performances, none more so than from Bruce Dern and June Squibb.	A beguiling and intimate change of pace for Payne.	Elegant in its simplicity and poetic in its message, Nebraska adds another stirringly resonant chapter to Alexander Payne's remarkable filmography.
Mildly quirky and zealously cute.	no amount of quality service can cover up a slice of life that has been so overbaked.	A superb turn from Kerri Russell and a strong one from Nathan Fillion compensate for some of the cloying sentiment and Southern condescension of the last film of Adrienne Shelly, whose tragic death last year abrupted the career of a promising artist.	Good-hearted, well-made comedy that will hopefully lead a broader audience to find the work [director Shelly] left behind as her legacy.	A bright , easy to like technicolored comedy that details the simple truths of trying to find happiness when you live in nowheresville and everyone is in your shit.	Sweet, smart, and quirky, Waitress hits the right, bittersweet notes through this romantic comedy through its witty script and a superb performance by Keri Russell.
The true tussle of the movie, however, is between the Spielberg who, like a cinematic Sandburg, is drawn aloft toward legend and the Spielberg who is tugged down by Kushner's intricate screenplay toward documentary grit.	Even if the movie is no classic, Day-Lewis' performance belongs to the ages.	Daniel Day-Lewis is so good in "Lincoln" he makes a $5 bill look phony.	A studied and stunningly wonky meditation on compromise.	Depicts a side of Abraham Lincoln and the American political system that is equally stimulating and intellectually inspiring.	Daniel Day-Lewis characteristically delivers in this witty, dignified portrait that immerses the audience in its world and entertains even as it informs.
A triumphantly self-amused, self-aware reflection on the verities of art and creativity and the lies that sustain them.	For all its nods, winks and witty asides, it's a richly personal work, picking over the questions every creative artist must eventually ask: Am I 'for real'? Does it matter? And what is all this work worth, anyway?	A singular combination of documentary, essay, narrative, broad comedy, hoax, and cinematic vaudeville.	At times T for tedious and P for pretentious, the film remains essential viewing for admirers of the great cineaste and showman.	F for Fake is a minor work in some ways, but there is fascination and poignancy in seeing Welles's elegant retreat into this hall of mirrors.	F for Fake playfully poses intriguing questions while proving that even Orson Welles' minor works contain their share of masterful moments.
Glorious Aussie follow-up to MAD MAX. Bigger crashes, more flamboyant villains, great offbeat characters. Too bad Hollywood ruined the franchise from here.	Quite simply the best action-exploitation film ever made.	I'm not necessarily a pessimist, and I believe that mankind will somehow muddle through into the future, but if things ever do go down, this future here seems a likely possibility.	One of the greatest action movies ever. Do I need to explain?	With a much bigger budget, more spectacular stunts than the first movie, this is undoubtedly the best movie in the series.	The Road Warrior is everything a bigger-budgeted Mad Max sequel with should be: bigger, faster, louder, but definitely not dumber.
This sequel to Night of the Living Dead (1968) abandoned the shadowy black-and-white creepiness of its progenitor in favor of a brightly lit color canvas that was bigger, broader, and bloodier.	As a blend of horror, action, tension, and humour, it stands in a class of its own.	Grim, gruelling but beautifully shot, this is intelligent, sophisticated horror.	Romero's script is banal when not incoherent.	I still get queasy thinking about the biker and the blood pressure machine!	One of the most compelling and entertaining zombie films ever, Dawn of the Dead perfectly blends pure horror and gore with social commentary on bourgeois society.
In many ways, the strength of this final chapter is also its weakness, in that the story almost drowns in the texture of its tapestry.. Shrouded by its amazing special effects however, the film looks wonderful	Although it represents a natural progression in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 will be a slog for those new to the Potter universe.	Go. Don't go. Nothing I write will make a difference.	Beautifully shot but a soulless cash machine, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1" delivers no dramatic payoff, no resolution and not much fun.	While The Deathly Hallows is not the best film in the series, it hardly matters. Too many people have invested too much in Harry Potter, they will not bear to miss the finale, or even his bleak and inconclusive prelude to the dark.	It can't help but feel like the prelude it is, but Deathly Hallows: Part I is a beautifully filmed, emotionally satisfying penultimate installment for the Harry Potter series.
It hardly delivers on the promise of giving us the pure, undiluted Williams -- Williams at his best. What's more, it's not even close to being his best movie. It's not even close to being good.	Williams is amazing.	Good Morning Vietnam remains one of my favorite films about the Vietnam war because of its comedic take and ability to slip into real drama when needed.	Robin Williams found his perfect role in this Vietnam comedy/drama.	If you haven't seen this one in a while, definitely consider picking it up again. I think it's a better film today than it was 18 years ago.	A well-calibrated blend of manic comedy and poignant drama, Good Morning, Vietnam offers a captivating look at a wide range of Robin Williams' cinematic gifts.
"Look, Ma! No fungus and no moss-syphilis!"	The story, while classic in nature, is a bit thin, but Bambi is a breathtaking, jaw-dropping showcase of the ingenuity and genius of Disney animators.	This animated feature based on Felix Salten's book about the coming of age of a fawn and his various forest friends (including the beloved Thumper) does convey some of the primal emotional power of Disney's features during this period.	Even Daryl Hall would have to admit this is one of the finest animated features committed to film, produced and packaged during Walt Disney's ballsiest years of control.	Fawn-dly revered Disney classic.	Elegantly animated and deeply touching, Bambi is an enduring, endearing, and moving Disney classic.
This is a well-judged, well-acted, absorbing drama and an exciting break from the norm because - in the figurative sense - there are no signposts.	Locke may be on the blower for most of the film's 85 minute running time, but you can hardly accuse Hardy of phoning it in. The actor delivers a masterclass in acting for the big screen.	Effectively revolves around questionable intentions from a man whose best efforts to "straighten" the family name may do just the opposite.	"Locke," with one man in a car for 85 minutes, is incredibly accomplished filmmaking.	Hardy gives Locke a calm, steady self-assessment, a kind of lucid despair. He's a guy forced to realize in one night that his life has no foundation.	A one-man show set in a single confined location, Locke demands a powerful performance -- and gets it from a never-more-compelling Tom Hardy.
This is not a history of rock 'n' roll guitar. It's a movie-fantasy version of the "favorite music" section on Guggenheim's Facebook page.	Davis Guggenheim's documentary hints at high concept but doesn't follow through. Still, it entertains, in a messy, flailing way.	It really should be about the music, not the talk.	Even longtime music fans are bound to pick up a fresh fact or two. But if you really want to enjoy this music, close your door, crank up a CD and whip out that air guitar.	Depicts wood, lacquer and hardware the way Hugh Hefner depicts Miss September. Guitar nuts will be turned on, but everyone else will have a good time, too.	An affectionate tribute to rock's most distinctive instrument, It Might Get Loud is insightful and musically satisfying.
If you've seen the trailers, you know exactly what to expect: 110 minutes of action and CG creatures. That's it, but sometimes that's enough.	Sometimes it's best to leave well enough alone, even if well enough is not perfect.	One time in college I watched Robot Monster on TV with red/blue 3D glasses from 7-11 and that was better for my eyes.	The first Clash Of The Titans had considerably more charm than this. Money can buy you technology but it can't buy you magic.	There's not a lot of humor in this new Clash -- not intentional, anyway.	An obviously affectionate remake of the 1981 original, Louis Leterrier's Clash of the Titans doesn't offer enough visual thrills to offset the deficiencies of its script.
Is this a light-hearted romp? Is this a psychological drama? Is it a thriller? Can it be all three? Not quite, Sort of. Uh Uh. And dear lord no.	This is the director's most likeable film in ages, even if it's insubstantial, overlong and, frankly, a touch redundant.	Its maker, Steven Spielberg, hasn't had so much fun in two decades, since he was schlepping Indiana Jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray.	...a light and breezy flick that showcases [Spielberg's] stars.	Catch Me if You Can would have been the best example of entertainment as an art form in the past decade if not for Spielberg's daddy issues hijacking the plot.	With help from a strong performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as real-life wunderkind con artist Frank Abagnale, Steven Spielberg crafts a film that's stylish, breezily entertaining, and surprisingly sweet.
One would have to be a melancholy Dane not to enjoy Shakespeare in Love's ample pleasures.	Wastes no time setting itself up as a rowdy, colloquial piece of popular entertainment -- the furthest thing from a fussy biopic of the Bard.	As overrated as Shakespeare himself.	It's a literary burlesque, remarkably clever and quick on its feet. It is ardently romantic but is at its best when it is funny. And it's funny.	The film grants a kind of insiders' knowledge, assuming certain educational, class and cultural parameters (much like those assumed by public television).	Endlessly witty, visually rapturous, and sweetly romantic, Shakespeare in Love is a delightful romantic comedy that succeeds on nearly every level.
Genuinely funny	A masterpiece! Too bold a statement you say? No way, Jose! You'll never pick up a can of Raid again.	Pure escapist fun!	Heads and shoulders above ANY animated film of the last year, and better than most live action movies, too.	A feel-good movie I'll be revisiting on many a rainy Saturday morning.	A Bug's Life is a rousing adventure that blends animated thrills with witty dialogue and memorable characters - and another smashing early success for Pixar.
Please, ladies, stay away or movies like this will never stop.	For all the profanity (quite a bit) and sexual sass, this CBS Films product plays even more like a TV movie than its debut project, Extraordinary Measures.	Sporadically amusing but rarely inspired.	This tepid romantic comedy falls somewhere between a weak sitcom pilot and a second-tier Hallmark movie.	A ditzy reproductive romance pitting maternal instincts against mutual relationship phobia. Plus a leading man who still does homework, a first trimester package deal infatuation, and puppy love for a two legged canine named Nutsy.	Jennifer Lopez is as appealing as ever, but The Back-Up Plan smothers its star with unrelatable characters and a predictable plot.
A thriller about creativity which doesn't display any of its subject matter.	A routine formula-driven movie that gets bogged down in bad dialogue and some ludicrous plot twists.	A huge amount of fun -- the Showgirls of cyberthrillers -- entertaining in ways its creators never intended.	Termina cayendo bajo el peso de sus propias pretenciones, su mal guión y sus planas actuaciones	This movie can take its rightful place in the pantheon of funny, bad movies.	Due to its use of cliched and ludicrous plot devices, this thriller is more predictable than suspenseful. Also, the acting is bad.
Sad, haunthing and completely unforgettable. The most authentic depiction of small town life I've even seen put on the screen.	Notre Dame professor Edward Fischer has said that 'the best films, like the best books, tell how it is to be human under certain circumstances'. Larry McMurtry did a beautiful job of this.	Peter Bogdanovich's eerie homage to olden times and movies, one of the key Hollywood films of the early 1970s, looks ever more crisply stunning and remote.	A worthy tribute to Bogdanovich's idols, Orson Welles and John Ford.	The Last Picture Show (1971) is an evocative and bittersweet slice-of-life 'picture show' from newcomer 31 year-old director Peter Bogdanovich	Making excellent use of its period and setting, Peter Bogdanovich's small town coming-of-age story is a sad but moving classic filled with impressive performances.
Cannot summarize - wonderful story, presentation, and performances. Please read review.	Give Care and McFarlane points for trying to do something innovative with the same old thing. But realize that, as spruced up as the facade may be, this movie is indeed still the same old thing.	An adolescent drama of higher purpose and artistry than most of today's juvenile movie fare.	A quietly comic little gem.	Despite an overwrought ending, the film works as well as it does because of the performances.	The inter-cutting of animation by Spawn's creator, Todd McFarlane, doesn't always work, but the performances by the young actors capture the pains of growing up well.
A true masterpiece of a film from the animation to the storyline behind the Lego universe.	The movie is a wonderful surprise, cleverly written and executed brick by brick with a visual panache.	An endlessly creative cinematic creation, this brilliant animated film exceeds all tired expectations and delivers the first fantastic movie of 2014.	Gloriously wise, beautifully crafted, and unabashedly fun.	This is a toy story worthy to stand alongside Toy Story, and a guaranteed future classic.	Boasting beautiful animation, a charming voice cast, laugh-a-minute gags, and a surprisingly thoughtful story, The Lego Movie is colorful fun for all ages.
The plot, as primitive as it is, still isn't very clear; it never acquires the spontaneity or the force of a true "story" but seems to exist mainly as a pretext for the familiar Ninja banter so beloved of the cult, as in "Cowabunga, dudes," and such forth	This one should have oozed out of the can before it got into any theaters.	Didn't seem quite as good as the first -- at least, in terms of reproducing the atmosphere of the original.	Clever if rather mechanical.	if a Vanilla Ice cameo is a highlight, imagine what the rest of the film is like	Not only is the movie's juvenile dialogue unbearable for adults, but the turtles' dopey and casual attitude towards physical violence makes them poor kids' role models.
The jump to more outré ghost-train-style horror is perhaps a tad blunt, but it remains scary enough to make it easy to buy into the supernatural ride it's intent on taking you on.	The tone is reminiscent of Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, but this film is actually more spine-tingling.	A supernatural horror flick by and for horror buffs.	If the film was attempting to be more than just a horror movie, it doesn't work on that level either.	After a suspenseful and shock-filled first hour, it loses control and veers off into routine supernatural silliness. I hate it when that happens.	Aside from a shaky final act, Insidious is a very scary and very fun haunted house thrill ride.
An audacious, inventive and relentless action movie.	It boggles the mind that after six years of silence, all Tarantino has to offer is this garbage.	A brash, bloody and simply exhilarating revenge melodrama and stylistic indulgence inspired by an imagination that spent thousands of hours absorbing pulp paperbacks, comic books, 'Kung Fu,' the mythology of Bruce Lee and Hong Kong chop-socky epics while	A marvel of strikingly original action setpieces and tight plotting, surrounded by a visual lyricism difficult to translate into words.	Really, it seemed to me that Tarantino was merely trying to shock people into forgetting the idiocracy of what was happening on screen.	Kill Bill is nothing more than a highly stylized revenge flick. But what style!
Slick but superficial.	Though you don't have to be a sports fan to find the background interesting -- or the on-ice choreography beautiful, there's something particularly poignant in their shared love of the sport.	Red Army is executive produced by Werner Herzog and Polsky borrows some his impishness. He makes sport of the old guard's rebuffs.	A fascinating and touching tale.	Fetisov is a jovial, imperious guide through an era of Cold War politics, when sports were a battleground between East and West and no sport was more important to the Soviets than hockey.	Fun and fascinating, Red Army delivers absorbing documentary drama for hockey fans and sports novices alike.
There's no attempt at humor in Dead Silence, but the biggest sin in the film is the lack of scares.	The movies have always asked us to suspend our disbelief, but Dead Silence demands our ignorance of its own derivations. A conflation of the horror genre's laziest tropes, plot angles and shorthands.	Saw creators Leigh Whannell and James Wan know scary: all that stuff that heebie-jeebied you when you were a kid. (Or as Entertainment Weekly would say: Dead Silence is awash with atavistic horror tropes.)	A very creepy little ditty that works once it rears up to the second half.	The spirit of Edward D. Wood Jr. is alive and well, and currently taking up residence in the movies of James Wan and Leigh Whannell.	More tasteful than recent slasher flicks, but Dead Silence is undone by boring characters, bland dialogue, and an unnecessary and obvious twist ending.
No belief on earth can rescue Swank from a film that's a chain of disaster chintz masquerading as a sermon.	I did like the bugs.	The Reaping suffers from the plague of a terrible script... The story floundered around like a drunk at Mardi Gras.	The Reaping isn't quite bad enough, or even New Testament enough, to qualify as a sign of the impending apocalypse. But by the time it's over, you know you're getting close.	He lays the photos out on the floor and the burn marks form a cross with a hook at the bottom, the unmistakable emblem of '70s hard rockers Blue Oyster Cult. Hey, didn't they have a big hit called "(Don't Fear) the Reaping"?	It may feature such accomplished actors as Hilary Swank and Stephen Rea, but The Reaping also boasts the apropos tagline "What hath God wrought?" It's schlocky, spiritually shallow, and scare-free.
As much a waking nightmare as it is a ripe showbiz melodrama and a bold sexual awakening for its protagonist.	Bizarre, beautiful and bewildering, 'Black Swan' is a study of madness.	Creepy & Tedious	Ballet can be Hell, and Aronofsky Never Lets You Forget It.	Only the very best directors can incite such passion, and only films this amazing can fully justify it.	Bracingly intense, passionate, and wildly melodramatic, Black Swan glides on Darren Aronofsky's bold direction -- and a bravura performance from Natalie Portman.
In keeping with the actual Grimm fables, as they were originally published before whitewashing took place, this movie has a lot of horror in it.	This film does for fairy tales what Time Bandits did for time travel stories	A mishmash of a film that flies off in far too many different directions.	It's a slog, an out-of-control fantasy that's strangely unenchanting and, in the end, rather tiresome.	Jar Jar Binks has finally met his match.	The Brothers Grimm is full of beautiful imagery, but the story is labored and less than enchanting.
Essentially just a big-screen episode of the series, and that's more than enough to satisfy any audience.	A host of cooler-than-cool voices/cameos (Reed, Anderson, Curry and the B52s) and throwaway humour do keep the adults happy the whole time.	The pleasant surprise is that the film is a delight.	Although it works on two levels, one thing makes it work for any age: the sense of the id unloosed.	Bored me silly. Really silly.	Charming characters; loads of fun for kids and adults.
Wildly original and entertaining.	A movie that makes the gigantic little argument that ordinary lives are important and that they are beautiful.	Cleverly and joyfully blurs the lines of real life with various dramatised versions of it.	Berman and Pulcini, documentary filmmakers making their narrative debut, have made a work as unvarnished as their subject.	... a crazy-quilt mix of fantasy, reality and hyper-reality that not only captures the essence of its comic-book source but of the singular mind behind it. He's a hero, all right. And, unlike many heroes, he actually gets the movie he deserves in Ameri	Exhilarating both stylistically and for its entertaining, moving portrayal of an everyman, American Splendor is a portrait of a true underground original.
A shattering and angry work of socially committed cinema that is one of the most emotionally devastating films of De Palma's entire career	If righteous indignation was the most direct highway to art, Redacted would be his masterpiece.	There is nothing innovative about Redactive, either in form or in content.	Deeply felt but dramatically unconvincing.	Brian DePalma has written and directed a deeply anti-American film, and that should be acknowledged, embraced, and defended as one legitimate reading of our country in 2007.	Despite DePalma's obvious commitment to the material and passion for the issues at hand, Redacted suffers from stereotypical characters and a forced faux-doc style.
Don't answer this made-for-TV style stinker.	Even by the lowest standards, this is a frightless, cynically made movie.	Films like this are more sad than anything else.	The scare-free When a Stranger Calls is the worst of the seminal horror movies from the late '70s and early '80s that have been getting the remake treatment lately.	A lot of boredom leading to a reel of running around in the dark and a Carrie rip-off shock tag scene as the cinematic maraschino cherry on top.	What's fitting punishment for running up the phone bill? Why have that person baby sit; that'll teach them. Or better yet, make that person through this poorly acted, fright-free remake of the 1979 movie of the same name. Camilla Belle is a looker, but she got nothing on Carol Kane, the actress who originally played the part, when it comes to range. The final straw is that the payoff isn't worth the tedium that comes before. Just hang up on this one.
A fantastically satirical picture with many chuckles and a goodly amount of suspense.	The paradigm of all end-of-the-world political thrillers and a part of the American vernacular.	Not only is the movie wickedly funny, it's a subversive anti-war film that shows just how easily a conflict could erupt and the end of the world be brought about.	It's easily one of the director's best films of his somewhat controversial career.	The shameful, criminal wrongs depicted in this document from the past are with us today.	Stanley Kubrick's brilliant Cold War satire remains as funny and razor-sharp today as it was in 1964.
The cast is little more than the sum total of golden skin, firm flesh and blindingly white teeth, but in a film that demands them to be half-naked and soaking wet most of the time, looks trump technical acting skill every time.	...there comes a point at which Into the Blue becomes just overwhelmingly silly...	Out of the murk.	It's eye candy with snorkels and fins.	It is an extraordinary cinematic achievement to take a story combining pirate treasure, drug runners, killer sharks, an airplane crash, car chases and Jessica Alba in a bikini, and turn it into an exercise in tedium.	Even the endless shots of bronzed beach babes and buffed dudes can't keep this soggy scuba flick's plot from drowning.
The result is almost always the handsomest of films to behold. Storywise it has its moments, too, although it never quite achieves the difficult blend of grandeur and madness for which it strives.	Give Boorman credit for the loopy grandeur of his imagery and imaginings, for the sweet smell of excess, for his heroic gamble that a movie can dare to trip over its pretensions -- and still fly.	Excessive but occasionally inspired, Excalibur gives us grimy lumbering knights, gloomy castles, slithering dragons, mesmerizing magic, and (of course) the struggle between good and evil.	Despite moments of high style and wit, [Excalibur] too often substitutes mayhem for magic.	It's like an excruciating Renaissance festival in a drug fog.	John Boorman's operatic, opulent take on the legend of King Arthur is visually remarkable, and features strong performances from an all-star lineup of British thespians.
I really enjoyed this stupid movie.	Strangers thrown together by fate are trapped inside an isolated diner as zombies converge outside %u2014 an army sent by God to clean out humankind.	Parental Content Review	At the end of the day - or should that be end of days - it boils down to nothing more than a glorified apocalyptic zombie movie.	An utterly ludicrous entry in the biblical-horror subgenre.	Despite a solid cast and intermittent thrills, Legion suffers from a curiously languid pace, confused plot, and an excess of dialogue.
The writing in Bride Wars is brittle and backbitey, and so are the characters.	You want to see Anne Hathaway in a worthy vehicle? Check out "Rachel Getting Married." You want to see Kate Hudson in a worthy vehicle?Rent a time machine.	They're real, dimensional humans, not wedding-obsessed fembots.	Appallingly simple-minded.	Shrill and shallow, 'Bride Wars' would make anyone wince at the thought of matrimony.	Bride Wars takes the already wearisome concept of battling bridezillas, and makes it thoroughly insufferable via a lazy script and wholly detestable characters.
It would have worked much better as a gritty drama about the most toxic non-violent criminal in Texas history.	Laugh-out-loud hilarious one moment and darkly tragic the next, I Love You Phillip Morris' tone is wildly uneven, never quite sure of what sort of movie it wants to be-and I loved it for it.	Carrey veers more toward In Living Color mimicry than Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind soulfulness. That approach completely undermines a love story that's already being told in a slipshod manner.	It's somewhat appropriate that the movie nearly debuted on DVD stateside since it's worth a rental for Carrey but too frustrating for the cost of theatrical admission.	With his manic glare, ferociously eager smile, hyperkinetic body language and talent for instant self-transformation, Mr. Carrey has rarely been more charismatic on the screen.	This fact-based romantic comedy has its flaws, but they're mostly overcome by its consistently sweet, funny tone and one of the best performances of Jim Carrey's career.
Harrison Ford gives one of his best performances in this underrated film.	Examines the consequences of a father's egotism on his family.	A stretch for Ford, but worth it. Unique and fascinating character study.	It's easy to forget how well Harrison Ford can play an unlikable character.	It's a testament to Ford's talent that we actually care what happens to him, because in a lesser actor's hands, we'd be hoping that some cannibalistic natives would eat him.	Harrison Ford capably tackles a tough, unlikable role, producing a fascinating and strange character study.
...delves a bit too giddily into the cruel and torturous techniques of its villain.	Saw is laughable, but it's worth laughing at.	An unsatisfying copout that falls apart five minutes after you leave the theater	I can't quite work up the nerve to fully recommend it (that ending is really awful) but I do appreciate the energy and skill that it has been made with.	As a study in the macabre, it barely suffices; as a sick and bloody joke, it's bloody sick.	Saw is more than nasty enough for genre junkies, but far too twisted, gory, and shallow for more discerning horror fans.
Recalls the sweep as well as the intimacy of a David Lean epic.	One of the best films of our time. The finest achievement of Kevin Costner's career.	Dances with Wolves is as genuine an artistic triumph as they come; a spellbinding American classic that tastes the tears of a country in the midst of all its incomparable beauty.	To say this movie is sporadically artful is to say that it is more interesting than most films around these days. But it is still a failure, if a glorious one.	Shining parable about hospitality, a human resource that seems to be underrated and in short supply in our world rife with hostilities.	A grand, sweeping epic with inarguably noble intentions and arresting cinematography, but one whose center, arguably, is not as weighty as it should be.
For lovers of romantic comedies through the ages, Roman Holiday remains a favorite.	Features one of the greatest endings to come from Hollywood	Paramount restored Roman Holiday for its release on DVD, and the result is crisp and glorious.	One of the best romantic films of all time.	Delicious and delectable Audrey's Oscar-winning American debut. But not such a difficult feat with William Wyler backing you up.	With Audrey Hepburn luminous in her American debut, Roman Holiday is as funny as it is beautiful, and sets the standard for the modern romantic comedy.
Although it's not as bad as its trailer might suggest, this first part of a projected three-part series will probably please the already converted but bore and annoy just about everyone else.	Though a bit stiff in the joints and acted by an undistinguished cast amid TV-movie trappings, this low-budget adaptation of Ayn Rand's novel nevertheless contains a fire and a fury that makes it more compelling than the average mass-produced studio item.	Atlas Shrugged. I arched eyebrow, scrunched forehead, yawned.	While staying true to Rand's vision, Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 suffers from poor directing and it lacks the sleekness it needs to connect with audiences.	There is something inherently noble about making a movie that gets the audience to think a little deeper. A dose of clarity and a pinch of fun never hurt either.	Passionate ideologues may find it compelling, but most filmgoers will find this low-budget adaptation of the Ayn Rand bestseller decidedly lacking.
There are no laughs to be found in writer-director Michael Traeger's would-be comedy The Amateurs, but there is one big mystery: how actors of this caliber could have been convinced to take part.	How embarrassing to see an actor of Jeff Bridges's calibre giving his all in such a terrible film. It's a lame comedy which raises only a few facetious groans.	Amateurs had all the potential in the world to be a charming, oddball delight, but it's a mess. A horrible mess. Albeit a horrible mess with some big laughs and the evergreen presence of Jeff Bridges.	As a writer, Traeger is consternatingly adolescent and glib.	It's just not much fun to watch first time director Michael Traeger aim for Capra-esque comedy and wind up closer to crap.	The Amateurs is a largely unfunny sex comedy that squanders a talented cast.
The trailer for 'The Waterboy' contains anything and everything from the film that might captivate an audience-the rest is just chafe.	There's something funny and endearing about Adam Sandler, even if his moronic movies are simply variations on each other and he always plays the nerdy, hapless hero.	No stretching involved, but he delivers. It's a safe date film.	Dehydrated!	The direction is as blunt and vacant as the plotting, the jokes are obvious and the performances (with a couple of exceptions) charmless.	This is an insult to its genre with low humor and cheap gags.
J.K. Simmons makes his character's teflon tactics a witty criticism and his line readings are like hilarious subtitles to the action.	Sour candy...redeemed by its humor and its clever construction, harkening back to the relatively optimistic crime comedy Fargo.	Maestros of time and place, the Coen brothers orchestra a convergence of incompetence, bad decisions and all-around silliness.	The Coens know how to write about dumb people, and everybody's dumb!. This...lets you come out of it no wiser, but probably in better spirits than when you started.	Nothing in the movie makes sense at all, but that's not necessarily a drawback.	With Burn After Reading, the Coen Brothers have crafted another clever comedy/thriller with an outlandish plot and memorable characters.
Confusing a serving of beefcake for real chow, American Outlaws sadly symbolizes the decline of the Western.	At its best, American Outlaws is absurd; at its worst, it's tedious and laughable.	A handsome and skillful retelling of a legend that imaginatively draws on conventions of both the western and the gangster movie to create an energetic yet thoughtful contemporary action-adventure.	Lazy storytelling at its worst, so disposable it is likely to be forgotten before it even reaches the end.	Along the way, the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang, who's the most popular cowboy in the gang, and who ought to go on MTV's Total Request Live.	With corny dialogue, revisionist history, anachronistic music, and a generically attractive cast, American Outlaws is a sanitized, teenybopper version of Jesse James.
A bleak and moving drama with reflective performance from Jack Nicolson	Remains, thirty years later, as rambling, flaccid, enigmatically brooding and ultimately tedious as it was back in 1975.	The best of Antonioni's three English-language pictures.	What is more interesting than the 'whys' and 'hows' of the plot however, are the 'where' and 'when.'	A fascinating and haunting film that played to the strengths of both actor and director.	Antonioni's classic, a tale of lonely, estranged characters on a journey though the mysterious landscapes of identity, shimmers with beauty and uncertainty.
It's important to finally put names and faces to the voices of these women because, without them, countless songs would sound horrible.	You know all those doo-doo-doos and whoa-whoas-whoas you hear in pop hits? Without them, supplied by the likes of Darlene Love and Merry Clayton, you likely wouldn't be singing along to the songs you hear on your car radio.	The message is that singing is a higher calling than chart success - a point this history makes with intelligence, grace and killer music.	More than a tribute, the film is a recognition of the talent and sacrifice that many of these vocalists have invested in often challenging careers.	Regardless of musical preference, this worthwhile documentary that pays tribute to backup singers is a crowd-pleaser.	Rich, insightful, and occasionally heartbreaking, 20 Feet From Stardom is an energetic tribute to the passion, talent, and hard work of backup singers.
Like watching a cut-rate Roger Corman rip-off of a big Hollywood film, only the tables are ironically turned. The big budget studio version seems pale in comparison.	a plot that has been reworked into something resembling crudely made hash	The fog also does something genuinely eerie: It causes everyone in the cast to deliver dreadful performances and display inappropriate reactions when their friends are drowned, burned, stabbed or thrown into glass display cases.	The actors do their best, under the circumstances. Welling makes an engaging lead and Grace employs her trademarked wounded, fragile look (that serves her so well in Lost) to good effect and wanders around in her underwear a lot.	With dialogue as dorky as the words new screenwriter Cooper Lane stuffed in their mouths, none of the hapless cast members could have sounded convincing.	The Fog is a so-so remake of a so-so movie, lacking scares, suspense or originality.
Yates paces the film at a clip that makes this, the shortest in the series so far, seem even shorter.	Although marred by some inept editing by Mark Day, The Order of the Phoenix is the first of the series to resound as a multifaceted narrative that understands its own intentions. It is intelligent.	On the screen, the stories, now in their fourth set of hands, feel uncomfortably fractured. Thank heavens for books.	A severely streamlined, stiff series low. Aside from Imelda Staunton's spirited performance and Daniel Radcliffe's typically impressive stoicism, this adaptation reduces J.K. Rowling's zesty prose to lumpy, gray porridge.	Basically, it's the Little Rascals to the rescue in a flick dressed up as a mystical fable replete with medieval mumbo jumbo and some cool, state-of-the-art special f/x. Otay!	It's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie, but director David Yates does a bang up job of it, creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed.
While the social commentary is as shallow as ever, the film's overall quality is better than the last two installments. That isn't saying much, but it's something.	In the end, SAW VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. SAW fans WILL walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise.	If you haven't followed the series up until now, there's not much point in trying to catch up.	Who knew that the franchise's creators would eventually find a plot twist that made sense?	Embora ainda năo tenha assumido o tom de auto-paródia que eventualmente envolve toda franquia do gęnero, a série já começou há muito a provocar risos involuntários.	It won't earn the franchise many new fans, but Saw VI is a surprising step up for what has become an intricately grisly annual tradition.
Beyond the Mat is frighteningly, grippingly real.	The documentary is quite easy to watch.	Surprisingly riveting.	turns out to be less interested in the cartoonish brutality of pro wrestling than it is with the lives of the people who make their living in the ring.	The real meat of the movie comes in the many intimate moments that Blaustein's camera catches.	Even if you aren't a fan, Beyond the Mat provides a riveting, perceptive look into the world of professional wrestling by taking a closer look at the people beneath the personas.
I'm glad to join the ranks of fans who continue to be breath taken with this incredible epic.	The first fight scene, which brings all the principals together, will make you want to applaud. And each action sequence builds on what has come before, increasing the stakes with a dignified hilarity.	Sit down to watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and enter into Ang Lee's enchanted cinema.	You've never seen a martial arts film like this one.	With his latest film, Lee has created a lyrical fairy tale for adults, a sublime synthesis of martial arts action with dramatic sophistication.	The movie that catapulted Ang Lee into the ranks of upper echelon Hollywood filmmakers, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon features a deft mix of amazing martial arts battles, beautiful scenery, and tasteful drama.
Strange and beautiful tale.	A fascinating docu-drama set in the Gobi Desert at a time when old folkways still hold sway over encroaching modernity.	Just a little too slow moving for me.	Fascinating and beautiful film.	...a little magical true-life fable, probably as strange to most of us as video games to Dude and Ugna.	Delightful and strangely moving.
A gag-inducing Four Loko misfire.	Silverstone guilelessly glides through her role like a Pam-sprayed charge card.	[It] isn't particularly memorable film, but it is still able to entertain those who happen to watch it.	Sly, witty comedy.	...although the movie isn't quite the classic it's been made out to be, it's a mindlessly diverting way to kill 97 minutes.	A funny and clever reshaping of Emma, Clueless offers a soft satire that pokes as much fun at teen films as it does at the Beverly Hills glitterati.
It is a nice fantasy and deserves some credit for not aiming specifically at a youth or teenage market. It is just a decent fantasy film that is there for whatever audience it finds.	A minor but very enjoyable Nicolas Roeg fairy tale.	As in his best films, here Mr. Roeg is a master of capturing the slightly off kilter sense of an apparently normal world. His camera is unobtrusive, and then suddenly it tilts a bit to jolt.	Strange and scary enough to fascinate parents and offspring alike.	It's not a film for small children. But for precocious first-graders with a warped sense of humor and an appetite for chills, thrills and spills, nothing could be better.	With a deliciously wicked performance from Angelica Huston and imaginative puppetry by Jim Henson's creature shop, Nicolas Roeg's dark and witty movie captures the spirit of Roald Dahl's writing like few other adaptations.
Beautifully redresses how the realities of women's lives are too often ignored on film... and does so with startling raw power and humor.	A small, offbeat dramatic comedy that deftly -- and humorously -- explores touchy territory.	The humor is balanced with small dramatic beats that lend authentic emotion to the proceedings.	Despite its controversial topic, it manages to be desperately romantic-maybe the biggest shock of all.	Sorry, partisans, but there's nothing obvious about "Obvious Child."	Tackling a sensitive subject with maturity, honesty, and wit, Obvious Child serves as a deeply promising debut for writer-director Gillian Robespierre.
Four stages of Acceptance Of 2-Star Movie: 1) Embarrassed for lead character. 2) Embarrassed for actor playing lead character. 3) Admiration for movie's all-out, gawky commitment to awkward comedy. 4) Annoyance with usual rom-com schmaltz-injections.	Despite the cringe early on there is a validation about finding your emotional and intellectual match, not just the fantasy dreamboat.	Oops, sorry, we're not supposed to think of Mary as mentally ill, psychologically unbalanced, or any of those painful things, just full of gumption and sunny determination.	We could care less about the characters in this dreadfully bad comedy.	In the final 30 or so minutes it turns deadly serious, which is about the only time this mess gets any laughs.	All About Steve is an oddly creepy, sour film, featuring a heroine so desperate and peculiar that audiences may be more likely to pity than root for her.
If only Bullock could have foreseen how bad Premonition would turn out to be, she would have spared herself (and us) a lot of agony.	A kinda supernatural, kinda psychological thriller that establishes a perplexing situation and never gets around to figuring it out.	It may be the first time you ever find yourself as confused as a contestant on Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader.	You'll feel both cheated and nonplussed at the conclusion after sitting through an hour and a half watching Sandra Bullock slowly morph into Gladys Kravitz.	...your Gimme-a-Break meter will probably be red-lined long before director Mennan Yapo drags you over the shaggy-dog finish line.	Overdosing on flashbacks, and more portentous than profound, the overly obtuse Premonition weakly echoes such twisty classics as Memento, The Sixth Sense, and Groundhog Day.
more like a troubled nap than a compelling flick	Season of the Witch begins in a Crusade taking place after the Crusades, in a 14th Century for Dummies about as immersive and real as the Ohio State Renaissance Festival.	Directed by the perennially hollow Dominic Sena from a script by Bragi Schut, "Season of the Witch" is all seams. It never balances out its competing desires...	Unchallenged and over-wigged, Cage is merely biding his time with this serving of horror hooey, obviously more interested in hearing the sweet sound of "cut!" than trying to make a tepid screenplay shuffle.	Cage's disappointingly subdued performance stands as the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back...	Slow, cheap-looking, and dull, Season of the Witch fails even as unintentional comedy.
The trouble with Proof is that, however efficiently it completes its task, you have to ask whether the job was worth starting.	Paltrow is left alone, much like Catherine, suffering and longing for someone - anyone - to come up to her level. No one ever does.	A decent film that...remains married to its words and bound to its limited sets.	It's a quiet kind of triumph. I know no one saw it but I hope more people will.	An extraordinary thriller about matters of scholarship and the heart, about the true authorship of a mathematical proof and the passions that coil around it.	Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins give exceptional performances in a film that intelligently tackles the territory between madness and genius.
Cold War metaphors delivered with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer dampens the storytelling.	Boxers are noted for their hubris, but Stallone, perhaps still punch-drunk from the early success, would have been better advised to have quit rather than suffer the body blows of this nonsense.	Ridiculous jingoistic nonsense.	[Stallone] creates credible villains worthy of his heroic character.	The new film's narrative is stripped down to essentials, which gives it an emblematic quality.	Rocky IV inflates the action to absurd heights, but it ultimately rings hollow thanks to a story that hits the same basic beats as the first three entries in the franchise.
This is Mr. Zemeckis' most confident directing to date. If he only had as much faith in his audience.	Zemeckis does a sturdy, absorbing job with the island and ocean scenes.	Hanks fans may very well love this movie, but it does not fulfill its promise.	Hanks delivers one of the best performances of the year. He did this despite great difficulties, among them: Zemeckis and his collaborator, Broyles.	The choppy narrative makes Chuck's ordeal seem more brief than it is. As shown, it's merely the world's worst layover.	Flawed but fascinating, Cast Away offers an intelligent script, some of Robert Zemeckis' most mature directing, and a showcase performance from Tom Hanks.
As a charmer the movie is not a klutz. Some mild excesses of whimsy are to be forgiven, even savored, like nibbling a few extra olives on your plate of antipasti.	Fun and romantic, with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve... or if our passports weren't missing.	sweet but uneven	Offers a delightful fairy-tale solution for those feeling trapped in a pre-assigned role, a momentary escape into the imagination.	A feel-good film with a schmaltzy love offering of tulips and bread.	Bread and Tulips is a sweet-natured comedy offering gentle, escapist entertainment.
(T)he cinematography and production design are outstanding, realistically capturing what Germany was like immediately after the end of WWII...This is not a film for everybody, but the acting and photography are worth the sit, despite the lack of pace.	A preposterous narrative convulsion is played with such conviction and sincerity that all reservations are swept to the wind.	Borrows tension, look and conventions from postwar film noir, and the Hitchcockian doubles, reversals and atmosphere of suspicion unbalance expectations of which character (if either) is cat or mouse.	﻿The intensely thoughtful director of Yella, Jerichow, and Barbara has returned with his favorite actress, Nina Hoss, for another of their immaculately realized dramas of psychological suspense and social culpability.	"Phoenix" is a film that starts slow, gathers momentum and hits you with the force of an express train at the end.	Tense, complex, and drenched in atmosphere, Phoenix is a well-acted, smartly crafted war drama that finds writer-director Christian Petzold working at peak power.
Say this, in sum, for Breathless: it is certainly no cliché, in any area or sense of the word. It is more a chunk of raw drama, graphically and artfully torn with appropriately ragged edges out of the tough underbelly of modern metropolitan life.	It retains its brilliance both as entertainment and as a groundbreaking work of art.	It actually seems more daring now than ever before and all the more vital as a result.	With Breathless [Godard] is attempting to break down the rules of the form he loves so much, in order to let us know that it is ALL on the table now, from subject matter to form.	It's energy over substance.	Breathless rewrote the rules of cinema -- and more than 50 years after its arrival, Jean-Luc Godard's paradigm-shifting classic remains every bit as vital.
You won't believe the world of Young@Heart, but you'll have a hard time resisting it.	The group is a testament to the healing capabilities of music. The choir itself deserves four stars; if the film had delivered the same grit and poignancy, it would have too.	Sure to be a hit not just with the AARP crowd, we'll surely see a lot of the film's ready-to-be excerpted videos.	One of the most remarkable scenes you will ever see in a documentary is the chorus of elderly men and women -- average age of 80 -- singing Bob Dylan's 'Forever Young' before convicts in a Massachusetts penitentiary.	Truth is, any heart that's open can connect with this vital, amusing, good rocking and very inspiring story.	Full of endearing characters, this doc about a choir of "seniors behaving badly" is uplifting and delightful.
Some third-act revelations may really test the scales of plausibility, but Poppy Hill ultimately is not about its story as much as the emotional states it probes.	From Up on Poppy Hill may be able to boast about its outstanding music and smooth animation, but it's far too flat to leave much of an impression.	[A] study of how the tolls of war reverberate through generations.	Rest assured, the younger Miyazaki has clearly earned his stars, as Poppy Hill offers just the same intimate, ultimately life-affirming kind of storytelling we've come to expect from the family name.	A film about many things-so many that the magic of Studio Ghibli's past has been displaced by exposition and earnest discussion.	Gentle and nostalgic, From Up on Poppy Hill is one of Studio Ghibli's sweeter efforts -- and if it doesn't push the boundaries of the genre, it remains as engagingly lovely as Ghibli fans have come to expect.
As far as major studio supernatural thrillers are concerned, this one is pretty darn good, a well-crafted, aesthetically artful suspenser.	As demonic children movies go, it?s really not bad -- and the acting makes it seem a little better than that.	What starts out as slight and fairly obvious turns into a frequently colorful horror tale.	The devil made them do it, but that doesn't mean you have to see it.	If I'm to understand the movie as it is presented, demons do not enjoy passive aggression, it only enrages them further, and to avoid a demon, it's best if you're neither a nice nor smart person, because then the demon has nothing to work with.	Director Christian Alvert has a certain stylish flair, but it's wasted on Case 39's frightless, unoriginal plot.
A magical tale that doesn't become maudlin when many films of its ilk could have. A beautifully touching performance from AnnaSophia Robb	Has inspired moments but too often feels like an extended after-school special, albeit one with good production values.	The film, though, takes us to a world in which imagination comes to life, with lavish CGI special effects giving the magic of Terabithia a palpable presence it never had in the book, even in Jess and Leslie's imaginations.	For all that Bridge to Terabithia does to encourage children to exercise their imaginations and pursue the arts, the movie's producers give only glimpses of the wonderful creatures and magical kingdom dreamed up by two children.	Una película entretenida y emotiva sobre la idea de la pérdida, el dolor, la culpa, y sobre todo de la imaginación como válvula de escape. No es el típico pasatiempo inocente que promete; es mucho más interesante que eso.	Bridge to Terabithia is a faithful adaptation of a beloved children's novel and a powerful portrayal of love, loss, and imagination through children's eyes.
Linklater's third masterpiece in the past decade should only affect anyone who's ever been someone else's sibling, child, parent, lover or friend.	The genius of Boyhood is that while watching it, you simply forget about the head-scrambling logistics of the project.	Full of empathy and fully realized detail, its specificity transforming into universality, an achievement of time and love that's already among the best films about childhood (and parenthood) you'll ever have the pleasure to watch.	It may be two and a half hours, and it may avoid the normal conventions of plot, but it has a weight and substance that feels like nothing else ... a truly singular movie-going experience.	Despite the wrinkles in Linklater's time tapestry, he has given us one of the most memorable movies of the year, and probably his own masterpiece.	Epic in technical scale but breathlessly intimate in narrative scope, Boyhood is a sprawling investigation of the human condition.
%u2026 while several [Irag war movies] have touched on the soldiers' internal experience, none have stayed with it for the duration of the film the way The Messenger does.	A penetrating assessment of post-war readjustment.	Intimate, powerful filmmaking.	The Messenger is a film about shock and healing. Forget awe. In a world that avoids the realities of war, The Messenger casts a flickering light on some of the human cost of war.	The film does lapse into cliche with Foster's descent into alcohol as a means of coping with the daily trauma of the job, but Israeli director Oren Moverman keeps the film rich in raw detail.	A dark but timely subject is handled deftly by writer/directer Owen Moverman and superbly acted by Woody Harrleson and Ben Foster.
Dracula deserves its status as a classic, although one might be tempted to append the word 'lesser' to that label.	...the film survives as a classic horror tale largely because of Lugosi's distinctive portrayal as Dracula.	A sublimated ghost story related with all surface seriousness and above all with a remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere.	[The music] contributes to Tod Browning's marvellous tone of restrained horror and stylish after-life.	Bathed in an atmosphere of nightmare, dread and otherworldliness that is unlike anything else in American horror cinema.	Bela Lugosi's timeless portrayal of Dracula in this creepy and atmospheric 1931 film has set the standard for major vampiric roles since.
Marc Singer's film shows an extraordinary world that exists below the streets of Manhattan.	One of the best films about the homeless ever made.	Dark Days is so engrossing it's easy to forget you're watching a movie. It's a film whose subject matter is so much larger, so much more interesting than sitting in a theater (or on your couch), that it's practically impossible not to get caught up.	Singer's grainy... photography lends the film the evocative aura of something that has been unearthed, while the spare, haunting soundtrack by DJ Shadow perfectly captures the sense of otherworldliness that pervades this remarkable film.	A remarkable film, and an unmissable rediscovery.	Marc Singer's documentary about a group of homeless people living beneath the streets of New York City is haunting and uplifting in equal measure.
It's about hype and, although it was made decades before the word was coined, it still has eye-opening things to convey about the slippery business of celebrity journalism. Such is the value of first-hand experience.	One of those rare films where you remember the names of the characters because you remember them -- as people, as types, as benchmarks.	Its script posses some of the sharpest dialogue ever written, and even if it's not exactly naturalistic, it's stylized in the best sense.	Loose, sleazy, brilliant and hyper-cool.	Mackendrick's nighthawk landscape is compellingly, poetically bleak.	Sweet Smell of Success boasts a top-notch cast, sharp direction, atmospheric cinematography, and an appropriately jazzy score, making it one of the best noir crime thrillers ever made.
Shockingly violent, chock full of scenes drenched in blood, this movie earns its R rating many times over.	Hey, I don't believe it literally, but it is a movie, after all -- it's a great story, too, certainly as compelling as "Dead Man Walking."	The movie's biggest sin lies not in where it chooses to cast blame, but in its bungled attempt at manufacturing what I suppose you'd have to call an epiphany of excess.	While this is clearly the most controversial film of the year, but I also happen to think it might also be the its most brilliant as well.	The Passion of the Christ is powerfully moving and fanatically obtuse in equal doses.	The graphic details of Jesus' torture make the movie tough to sit through and obscure whatever message it is trying to convey.
It's visually interesting and demands you leave the theatre talking about what just happened.	The dangerous byplay between Rampling and Sagnier gives Swimming Pool a surprising depth.	Although copious amounts of French nudity constitutes, to some degree, its own reward, Swimming Pool is marred by stupor and a fake-as-Lee-Press-On-Nails coda.	... sensual and enigmatic	Ozon even steals from himself...Eventually, [his] compulsion to imitate becomes an end in itself, taking his movie in directions it hasn't been built to travel.	A sensual thriller with two engaging performers demanding our undivided attention.
This tepid sequel is a compelling argument for royal family planning.	Saddled with the sort of dialogue that would fell a von Trapp.	The movie is undeniably cute. But it's also often a gooey mess, with a plot that manages to be both wearisome and preposterous (to grown-ups, that is).	Princess Diaries 2 has plenty of returning cast members and the same competent if bland direction. Yet why does it feel like an infomercial for the soundtrack?	The film had a goofy sense of humor, some deft casting...and, best of all, a genuinely charming, star-making performance by Anne Hathaway in the lead role.	Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews bring charm and elegance to the movie, but there's not enough material for them to work with in this sequel.
Watching Czerny's version of Walsch struggle, it's hard not to connect with him, even if you don't connect with his message.	It's inspiring to see how Walsch conquered the odds, but at times Conversations With God feels like a subliminal advertisement for the book.	...boils down to the assertion that God is that voice in your head, a fairly innocent concept until God starts telling you to do something wrong.	It may appeal to those who get teary eyed over Hallmark cards, but will bore anyone who views religion with passion and maturity.	Guess it's comforting to believe that God might make contact in even the blandest of conditions. But I can't see this movie meaning much to any but the already converted.	At some point in the conversation, God must have asked for a subtler, deeper film.
A rousing 3-D sci-fi adventure that celebrates the teamwork between a man on an important mission and a band of insects.	Ant-Man is this year's Guardians of the Galaxy. It focuses on a peripheral, wisecracking member of the Marvel Universe, adding a generous dose of humor to its superhero action.	The thing has got big laughs, a real heartbeat, and a modesty of scale that, next to the mega machinery of most Marvel movies, is kind of a relief.	Ant-Man has a suitably small-scale story for its tiny hero, which was a breath of fresh air when compared to the other more bloated entries in the MCU.	Even with such a weird concept about a guy who can shrink and then communicate with ants ... there's way too much that feels familiar here.	Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd, Ant-Man offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale -- albeit not as smoothly as its most successful predecessors.
Wily humor and sly observations about the lives of these high rollers are the highlights... It's when those give way to issues of morality that the film disappoints, just a little...	...a series of increasingly alarmed faces looking at papers and computer screens.	Chandor writes monologues for seemingly every member of the ensemble, which gets a bit wearying, but is also how I'm guessing he attracted this stellar cast.	Though stagey, the film incisively explores a crisis in a financial house.	"Margin Call" employs an excellent cast who can make financial talk into compelling dialogue.	Smart, tightly wound, and solidly acted, Margin Call turns the convoluted financial meltdown of '08 into gripping, thought-provoking drama.
Middle-aged folks may not be attracted to the film's rap base but the built in youth demographic will love it.	Following L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys, this makes a remarkable hat-trick for Hanson and is a personal triumph for Eminem.	Effective, if not more than a little dishonest. Think Blue Crush with swear words.	If not strictly autobiography, the movie is close enough to Eminem's story that he knows how this character feels. If this turns out to be the only role he ever plays -- which I doubt -- he can be happy that he played it to the limit.	Funny, well-acted and surprisingly engaging.	Even though the story is overly familiar, there's enough here for an engaging ride.
Their nuanced performances give a spectrum of emotional shadings to a black-and-white script that casts Tina as the Beauty to Ike's unreconstructed Beast.	Angela Bassett does a good acting job as a person in Tina Turner's position, easily winning audience sympathy.	A melodrama of starry-eyed love and black-eyed beatings, exhausting road tours and the singer's even harder road to self-realization, the movie contains its emotional highs and lows in the hermetically sealed bio-pic format.	The brilliant, mercurial portrayal of Ike Turner by Laurence Fishburne is what elevates What's Love Got to Do With It beyond the realm of run-of-the-mill biography.	It's a story of pain and courage, uncommonly honest and unflinching, and the next time I hear Tina Turner singing I will listen to the song in a whole new way.	With a fascinating real-life story and powerhouse performances from Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne, What's Love Got to Do With It? is a can't miss biopic.
Comes off like an amateur production.	It's kind of predictable, but the acting is good and McKewin's script is a hoot.	You won't take much home with you, but it's fun while it lasts.	Hardly a landmark in the annals of pigskin cinema. But for sports fans seeking relief from a lackluster summer of baseball, even this sloppy exercise can evoke a needed chuckle or two.	A retread of an oft-used Hollywood plot.	The cliched characters and obvious outcome make all the fun and excitement amount to nothing.
Hope for 4-eyed computer experts who let their mother's dress them.	Although the time period may feel ambiguous, its message of everyone feeling like an outsider and just wanting to belong, is universal.	A teen-sex comedy with a brain!	The kind of movie you saw on video when it was still forbidden fruit and loved it, only to find it much uglier with the rose-colored glasses removed.	The conflation of discriminated-against minorities and discriminated-against nerds is something of an uneasy pairing, but it does bring out the fact that predjudice is prejudice, no matter who it's aimed at or for what reason.	Undeniably lowbrow but surprisingly sly, Revenge of the Nerds has enough big laughs to qualify as a minor classic in the slobs-vs.-snobs subgenre.
Tilda Swinton is both imperious and vulnerable ... in this lush romantic melodrama that harks back to the heady days of Visconti and Antonioni.	Sumptuous, overheated, and ridiculous, Love is a visual delight -- the opening montage of a snowy Milan alone make it worthwhile	anybody who wants to experience cinema at its most cinematic and grand should rush and experience it for themselves. It is a truly stunning motion picture and one that ranks as the best film 2010 has so far offered.	The highest praise is that it lives up to its extravagant title	Words like "lush" and "gorgeous" don't even begin to scratch the surface in describing I Am Love, Italian director Luca Guadagnino's retro-styled melodrama.	It stumbles into melodrama, but I Am Love backs up its flamboyance with tremendous visual style and a marvelous central performance from Tilda Swinton.
Carrey is the ultimate party dude, and like the masked man says, this party is smokin'.	The Mask is a perfect vehicle for the talents of Jim Carrey, who underwhelmed me with Ace Ventura, Pet Detective but here seems to have found a story and character that work together with manic energy.	Carrey, the star of the surprising hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and a regular on TV's In Living Color, acquits himself well in a part of sublime goofiness.	Carrey may be the finest comic to come along since Robin Williams.	The design is bright as a button and the transformation scenes real eye-poppers, but the film's best special effect is putty-faced Carrey with his razzle-dazzle star turn as the affable Stanley and his manic alter ego.	It misses perhaps as often as it hits, but Jim Carrey's manic bombast, Cameron Diaz' blowsy appeal, and the film's overall cartoony bombast keep The Mask afloat.
Thompson admirers will enjoy the film the most, of course, but even the uninitiated will surely find him a fascinating character, if not always a likable one.	It's more Thompson-for-beginners than an exhaustive inquiry, but as introductions go, it's thorough and thoughtful.	'Gonzo' banks on an adolescent delight in seeing the debunking of the powers that be, but, like Thompson's run for office, that's of no help in the final tally.	In the manner of such key Thompson works as 'Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72,' the movie links entertaining personal biography with fascinating cultural history...	Reading his books will give you better insight, but it's hard to imagine a better primer into Thompson's outlaw life.	While not the comprehensive profile of the man that his die-hard fans might have hoped for, Gonzo remains an insightful introduction to the life of rebellious writer Hunter S. Thompson and his influences.
If the movie falls just shy of our highest mark, this is because Cronenberg is tamping down on his usually naturalistic performances -- everything feels vaguely mad-scientist-ish.	What could have been, and should have been, an electrifying subject matter, has been ground down to a laborious exercise in pseudo psychoanalysis.	The doctors become heralds of a savage century in which unconscious urges find such destructive expression that even kids who've barely heard of Freud can identify bombs and missiles as phallic symbols.	Infinitely assured moviemaking.	Pivots as much on political gamesmanship and intellectual dominance as sadomasochistic urges and infidelity.	A provocative historical fiction about the early days of psychoanalysis, A Dangerous Method is buoyed by terrific performances by Michael Fassbender, Keira Knightley, and Viggo Mortensen.
A nifty story about some sympathetic and idiosyncratic characters struggling with love and reaching out for their small share of happiness.	Helen Hunt stars in, directed and co-wrote Then She Found Me, and she handles each chore beautifully.	Where it really matters -- working with actors -- veteran filmmakers could learn from Hunt.	Dialogue is a blunt-force trauma in Hunt's directorial debut, which behaves like some avant-garde theatre production where all the stage directions are spoken aloud.	There's food for thought in the pregnancy plot, although the narrative drags its heels towards a misty-eyed conclusion.	A threadbare story anchored by strong performances, Then She Found Me is a mostly successful directorial debut by Helen Hunt.
We Are The Best is, well, one of the best and without giving anything away, I can assure you that its grand finale is as wonderfully satisfying as any ending that I have seen in a long time.	The music here is really just a Macguffin, a way into Moodyson's real subject: the complex and often unequal dynamics of adolescent friendships.	It portrays the kind of rush of unfettered, probably crap inspiration that one relishes before self-criticism and self-doubt kicks in.	Lukas Moodysson's film allows its trio of girls to express themselves through gender, certainly, but not undermine their desire to be heard as artists first.	The great charm of Lukas Moodysson's We Are the Best! lies in its total lack of pretension and adult editorializing.	Sweet, empathetic, and shot through with a palpable joy, We Are the Best! offers a tender tribute to the bittersweet tumult of adolescence.
I have to admit I was more than intrigued by a film featuring an epileptic taxidermist with a photographic memory who fancies that he can commit the perfect crime.	The Aura holds together as a dreamy variation on Reservoir Dogs' heist-gone-wrong fatalism and the know-thyself confrontations of David Mamet's Homicide.	A fuzzy attempt at significance that seems as aimlessly lost in the woods as its heist-plotting characters.	If less neatly realized than Nine Queens, The Aura is the more ambitious film. It is all the more haunting for suggesting narrative possibilities that Bielinsky was just beginning to explore.	gives off scents of melancholy and dread that are rarely seen in heist films	The Aura is a highly original and cerebral thriller that maintains its suspense from start to finish.
Arrestingly beautiful.	A film that succeeds both as biography and poetic travelogue.	We're led to experience her life as she does -- as an adventure in which setbacks are not challenges, but illuminations of untracked paths.	Exquisitely beautiful for the eyes as for the ears.	This 'sound journey' (as the subtitle of the film calls it) has much to like and recommend.	Not only does this documentary introduce viewers to Glennie, it gives them a taste of how she perceives the world.
Best of Enemies' detached, sportish depiction of their feud only explores their influence in the shallowest manner.	Like its two subjects, "Best of Enemies" is lively and smart. Unlike them, it's even-handed.	The doc's centerpiece - the series of debates, which escalated as the protests outside did the same - is giggly stuff. But it's the postscript that takes it to another level.	Works so well because the filmmakers understand that the personalities at the center of the fray should anchor things.	Best of Enemies offers a bracing view of a pivotal time in our recent history, as Vietnam and race riots scarred a nation's soul, and as the Establishment and the Counter Culture exchanged epithets and blows.	Smart, fascinating, and funny, Best of Enemies takes a penetrating -- and wildly entertaining -- look back at the dawn of pundit politics.
In WWJB, we don't really feel like we get to know anyone that well, not even the primary subjects of the film: Billy and his choir.	If you're going to live by the word of the Church of Stop Shopping, a smart first step would be to avoid buying tickets to this film.	Reverend Billy is a charismatic presence, even if his shtick is too silly and the documentary too unfocused to motivate any serious change in the nation's holiday spending habits.	If Gary Busey ever played Elmer Gantry, he'd look like Reverend Billy, the real-life fire-and-brimstone preacher who embarks ''on a mission to save Christmas from overconsumption."	In a strange way, "What Would Jesus Buy?" might actually be the most heartwarming holiday movie out there this year.	WWJB is an eye opening doc about consumerism that manages to be both funny and informative.
Zobel's film shocks, but leaves the viewer to uncover the real story for themselves.	A film designed to provoke social as well as cinematic comment.	...a movie that feeds on collective emotions -- anger, denial and, most of all, fear -- but also triggers explosives along the faultlines of class.	Zobel shoots his queasy little psych test with I'm-just-the-messenger documentary neutrality, challenging as he goes: Do you want to look away now? How about now? Will you walk out?	[Zobel] forgets that less is often more and his film loses credibility...In the end everyone just seems excessively stupid because we have never been complicit.	Anchored by smart, sensitive direction and strong performances, Complicance is a ripped-from-the-headlines thriller that's equal parts gripping and disturbing.
[Alfonso Cuaron] has never made a special-effects movie before, and he's careful to balance the ooh-ahh moments with human interaction.	Visually marvelous.	A masterpiece.	A new filmmaker provides his take on the third book by author and creator J. K. Rowling, providing a darker tone that meets the book halfway for its... wiser student wizard.	The Prisoner of Azkaban is basically a routine vehicle that plods its way through details without giving much incentive to feel engaged by the specifics.	Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling.
I dropped outside of time and was carried along by the narrative flow; when the film was over, I had no particular desire to leave the theater, and would happily have stayed another three hours.	You weep, laugh, celebrate and mourn with the characters throughout the six hours, which at once seem like an eternity and an instant.	With the six-hour running time, Giordana gets the space to let the characters live and let their shared story unfold like a good novel.	Among the least cynical and most humanistic features of recent times.	All the pieces converge in a powerful rush during the second half.	Earns its 6 hours running time by telling an engrossing story with compelling characters.
...achieves a miraculous level of kitchy zip thanks to its creative casting of Kurt Russell, Lynda Carter, and Bruce Campbell.	Dissatisfying to an adult audience accustomed to more sophisticated parody....will resonate with young viewers on their way to high school.	Here, teen empowerment takes on a very literal form, even if events never stray far from the world as envisaged in a John Hughes movie.	The film makes up for the paper thin clichéd story-line by having fun with superhero mythology.	It's Harry Potter meets The Incredibles minus the memorable characters, hearty laughs, great writing and all around movie goodness.	This highly derivative superhero coming-of-age flick is moderately entertaining, family-friendly fluff.
The Santa Clause 3 strikes out.	Nuance surely isn't Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause's name, but its performances are pleasing %u2014 Martin in particular brings a smirky, self-centered glee to his role %u2014 and its story isn't condescending. It's brisk and colorful, right on	An ugly, dispiriting, prefabricated lump of coal. With any luck, The Santa Clause 3 will be but a distant memory by the time December 25 arrives.	You play Santa Claus once with enthusiasm, twice with affection, three times for a paycheck.	Shot almost entirely on a single set possibly left standing from the last film, it features what looks like first-take performances and a script that's inane even by kiddie-movie standards.	Playing Jack Frost as an evil cross between Liza Minnelli and Liberace, Martin Short is a welcome presence, but this tired series continues drawing from its bag of bland gags and dumb slapstick.
To Be and To Have works in the grandest tradition of documentary filmmaking -- it keeps company with a small, specific place going about its business, and from it parses the whole world.	It's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it.	The beauty of To Be And To Have is that Lopez's loss isn't the audience's. This movie is a portal, leading to a living museum of childhood.	Philibert and his crew remain invisible throughout most of the this film's running time letting a way of life that is surely short-lived speak for itself.	A wonderful French documentary about a diligent teacher in a one-room classroom who revels in those magical moments when learning yields insight and delight.	A small, sensitive, and moving portrait of a teacher and his students.
Creative Cold War Bond thriller is best for teens and up.	One of the shiniest examples of Bonds from golden Connery era.	FRWL has character and dash, and even something of a conventional plot, all worth revisiting for this pin-sharp restoration.	Much of it borders on the inept and the embarrassing, and that goes for the title song sung by Matt Monro, the "singing bus-driver".	This is probably the best Bond film made.	The second James Bond film, From Russia with Love is a razor-sharp, briskly-paced Cold War thriller that features several electrifying action scenes.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt's writing/directing/starring debut is like its diamond-in-the-rough title character. It shows a lot of unrealized potential, with enough charm to ease you past its shortcomings.	On page and screen, Gordon-Levitt mostly fails to transform his bulky title protagonist into a multi-dimensional figure. He belongs in the final 15 minutes of an SNL episode, not at the center of a full-sized comedy.	"Don Jon" is bold and clever. Very sophisticated and mature in the way it showcases the sexuality of men and women.	Johansson walks away from Don Jon with one her best performances to date.	An overheated disquisition on the pleasures and limitations of masturbation.	Don Jon proves to be an amiable directing debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and a vivacious showcase for his co-star, Scarlett Johansson.
Undeniably compelling, it's proof of the therapeutic potential of filmmaking, but also of our limitless propensity for morbid curiosity.	Nearly impossible to watch, thoroughly unpleasant yet strangely arresting.	It is a remarkable film, immediate, urgent, angry, poetic and stubbornly hopeful.	Hey, it's not every 11-year-old boy who wants to grow up to be Ellen Burstyn.	A remarkable and remarkably compelling document.	Using music and home video footage to great effect, Jonathan Caouette has made a very personal and moving film.
The Mechanic is marked by relentless blood-letting and violence, with in-your-face crashes and explosions and all the other wild-eyed and utterly illogical activity that makes good action/adventure so exhilarating to watch.	The 2011 film, by comparison, is a tightly wound, more stylish creature.	[VIDEO] Anything you do, don't underestimate "The Mechanic." This is one badass movie.	'The Mechanic' is the prototypical early year action movie-nothing more and nothing less. Statham, who again plays an infallible, lethal bad-ass, seems to have carved his niche as the current go-to guy for B-movie action flicks.	Despite the dependably uber-cool presence of Jason Statham, The Mechanic doesn't wield enough inventiveness or attitude to fix its overriding sense of familiarity.	Jason Statham and Ben Foster turn in enjoyable performances, but this superficial remake betrays them with mind-numbing violence and action thriller cliches.
One of the most genuinely sweet love stories to come along in quite some time.	Warm-hearted but ultimately soft!	A torturous endurance test!	Builds toward an emotional crescendo that will fill you with tears, many of joy.	This movie offers itself to us like a cow with too many udders.	Made-for-tv drama evokes anything but real emotion.
A coffinload of DVD extras to sate your Lost Boys bloodlust!	Overdirected and junky, but mildly amusing.	This is, however, a cinematographer's film and while everyone else seemed to be putting in half-hearted efforts, the cinematographer was working overtime.	A hugely enjoyable picture that proves Joel Schumacher really can direct and that not everything about the 1980s was awful.	The Lost Boys is heady, cutting-edge vampire stuff. Mind you, it's also very tongue-in-cheek. So watch out for those fangs, gang.	Flawed but eminently watchable, Joel Schumacher's teen vampire thriller blends horror, humor, and plenty of visual style with standout performances from a cast full of young 1980s stars.
A knockout new thriller by John Woo.	Watching Travolta and Cage play dual hero and dual villain roles remains the most enjoyable aspect	...with Face/Off, [Woo] wonderfully balances bloodbaths with plot and depth.	Travolta and Cage then had the acting difficulty of adopting the other person's mannerisms while retaining their own voice and body. There are both superb at it...	It could be argued that this movie's callousness toward human life is nihilistic and nasty. But Woo takes everything so absurdly far that audiences laugh at what horrified them moments before.	John Travolta and Nicolas Cage play cat-and-mouse (and literally play each other) against a beautifully stylized backdrop of typically elegant, over-the-top John Woo violence.
Instead of sticking to the undeniably moving facts, this movie veers off into distracting and soapy subplots.	At its best, North Country conveys what it's like to be a small-town social pariah and to fear for yourself in the workplace.	...there's little doubt that the movie would not come off even remotely as well as it ultimately does were it not for the effectiveness of the cast.	North Country has a ton of powerful moments, so it is an odd choice that it falls back on the 'based in fact' element.	North Country is in the tradition of workers-rights films like Norma Rae and Silkwood in that it sends its message through a convincing character whose temerity and courage are accompanied by less heroic baggage.	Though sometimes melodramatic and formulaic, North Country is nonetheless a rousing, powerful story of courage and humanity.
Another pointless remake.	This deliberately paced remake of the superior 2010 Mexican film of the same name has some stylish atmospheric touches, although it could use more of the twisted sense of humor it only flashes in spurts.	Like all good horror stories Mickle's film is really about something else, and the two female leads give terrific performances as cloistered teenagers struggling to come to terms with their place in their world.	An ambitious (if somewhat uneven) slice of downbeat American gothic which interweaves grim melancholia with pointed satire, doomy portent and moments of gnawing revulsion.	A superb grief-soaked horror set in a desperated, godless universe, WAWWA is unnverving and moving in equal measures, easily eclipsing the original.	A compelling story cleverly told, We Are What We Are quenches horror buffs' thirst for gore while serving up serious-minded filmmaking and solid acting.
She remains one of the funniest, dirtiest, most daring and transgressive of stand-up comics, and she hasn't missed a beat.	A Piece of Work is not about revelation or exposé. It is, instead, about Joan Rivers' business.	A Piece of Work does a solid job of deepening our understanding of Rivers, but its accomplishments pretty much end there.	...a well made, sporadically fascinating documentary...	[A] sad, startling exploration of the vagaries of fame, the insecurities of celebrity, and the realities behind the typical 'but it's just a joke' excuses that prop up cheap, vulgar humor.	Penetrating Rivers' coarse image, this compelling documentary offers an honest, behind-the-scenes look at her career -- and at show business in general.
A well crafted clashing of sub-genres and themes that works to its advantage, making it an instant cult classic...	Teeth is a solid first effort that makes you extremely curious about the filmmaker's next project.	That the movie manages to successfully transcend shock value is probably its greatest accomplishment.	The tone of the film wavers between satire and horror-comedy, but that doesn't diminish the entertainment value of what plays like a tongue in cheek celebration of a woman who turns her imperfection into empowerment	Credit writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein with making a first feature that every man in America will watch with his legs crossed.	Smart, original, and horrifically funny, Teeth puts a fresh feminist spin on horror movie tropes.
An earnest and occasionally poignant attempt to penetrate Rebney's potent man-on-fire image and explore the impact of becoming an Internet sideshow.	I think this is a disingenuous and shallow movie about a fairly interesting guy.	Winnebago Man, which appears to be notably less staged than other documentaries of this ilk, doesn't relentlessly explore all the corners of Rebney's life -- which makes him an even more fascinating subject.	What started as an underground goof ended up becoming a fascinating foul-mouthed curio; though it aims for profundity, Winnebago Man seems destined to suffer the same fate.	[Director Ben Steinbauer's] blend of exploitation and sincerity proves remarkably efficient, and helps illustrate how new media have democratized the arts.	Though it doesn't quite answer all of the questions it raises, Winnebago Man is nevertheless a fascinating, hilarious, and surprisingly poignant look at a geniunely colorful internet celebrity.
Clearly embraces the spirit of the beloved novelist.	Although the film does eventually give up its referential conceits, it comes far too late in the game to salvage any real emotional investment in the characters or their plight.	A dull exercise in deconstructing Jane Austen's life to provide a life experience basis for her novels.	If you're a Jane Austen fan, your sense and sensibility will demand you check this out.	Inevitably exudes a kind of hand-me-down quality, the feeling of being a second-rate copy instead of a true original, at once too clever and not clever enough.	Although Becoming Jane is a well-crafted period piece, it lacks fresh insight into the life and works of Jane Austen. The film focuses too much on wardrobe and not enough on Austen's achievements.
It's an affected film about disaffected people, and no cast in the world could save it.	A companion piece to Tenenbaums more than a step in new directions, Darjeeling is a movie about people trapped in themselves and what it takes to get free...	Unless he branches out into new territory aesthetically and thematically, Anderson's best days may be behind him, not in front of him	Being faintly disappointed by a new Wes Anderson film -- films whose primary form of emotional address, after all, is faint disappointment -- remains one of the few consistent pleasures of American moviegoing.	Those who relished Anderson's candy-coloured bittersweet style in The Life Aquatic should enjoy the trip.	With the requisite combination of humor, sorrow and outstanding visuals, The Darjeeling Limited will satisfy Wes Anderson fans.
While it took 27 years between films, Queen and Country proves to be a lovely counterpoint to Hope and Glory.	Boorman returns to the classical style of the movies he enjoyed at a young age, again showing his flexibility and commitment to finding a story's ideal tone.	Sweeping, witty, delightful and charming while brimming with warmth and humanism.	Queen and Country finds exhilarating comedy in places usually reserved for drama, violence, loss.	A worthy follow-up to a classic.	Graceful and bittersweet, Queen and Country finds writer-director John Boorman revisiting past glories with warmth and wisdom.
Bruno is curiously ineffective, a sort of middling effort that fails to liberate itself from the stereotypes that provide the character's foundations, even if it also doesn't deliberately or harmfully reinforce them.	It's an odd cop-out for so fiercely gifted a comedian.... This is not a man who is doomed to be Allen Funt, or for that matter, Ashton Kutcher. He doesn't need to rely on the easy titillations and voyeuristic pull of reality TV.	Bruno is not nearly as ambitious as Borat, where Cohen's talent to outrage ranged far and wide. He's no longer a saboteur. He's become part of the machinery.	There's good bad taste and then there's just plain bad bad, which is what describes most of Brüno.	A Vapid, Empty and Relatively Hateful Flick. And this is From Someone Who Loved "Borat".	Crude and offensive, but with ample cultural insights and gut-busting laughs, Bruno is another outlandish and entertaining mockumentary from Sacha Baron Cohen.
Branagh's directing style is soupy and derivative of all the wrong movies.	An interesting concept by Branagh, and a touching De Niro performance. It is hit-and-miss at times, a bit overwrought.	Different look at the old Frankenstein story, directed by Branagh.	Visceral and energetic sceen translation of this literary classic.	Branagh is very obsessed with chewing the scenery. So much so that he even manages to outdo Robert DeNiro.	Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is ambitious and visually striking, but the overwrought tone and lack of scares make for a tonally inconsistent experience.
Dazzling nature doc chooses poetry and wonder over storytelling and effects.	Boasts extraordinary images rendered with a clarity sure to become a touchstone for nature docus; even viewers who don't care about fish will find plenty to exclaim about.	Though never quite as stirring as March of the Penguins or Winged Migration, it quickly establishes its own gentle pace.	The movie unpretentiously and effectively shows how our cultural, personal and environmental history not only shape us but affect our decisions.	Oceans contains some of the most beautiful imagery ever seen in a feature-length documentary.	Oceans adds another visually stunning chapter to the Disney Nature library.
The film is both a police thriller and a drug addled fantasy with an iguana for a guide and Cage plays it like Hunter S. Thompson with a badge.	Despite the snake slither-swimming through the bars of a flooded cellblock, the injured alligator and the iguanas that seem to be crooning Johnny Adams' 'Release Me,' star Nicolas Cage may be the most reptilian presence here...	Instead of plumbing the depths of spiritual degradation, Herzog's movie is -- largely due to Cage's performance -- almost fun.	Bad Lieutenant doesn't go where you expect, but it has a stubborn, trippy logic.	Bad Lieutenant, Bad!	Befitting its unorthodox origins, this Bad Lieutenant benefits from Werner Herzog's typically fearless direction and a delightfully unhinged Nicolas Cage in the title role.
The only truly graspable notion the film can be said to put forth is one of increasingly tedious sci-fi-romantic genre busy-ness.	At the 44-minute mark (I checked) of 'Mr. Nobody,' I loudly sighed and asked, "Good God, when the hell is this movie going to START!"	ambitious as all get out and a wonder from start to finish.	While Mr. Nobody contains some truly moving scenes, it eventually starts to try your concentration when you suspect all the space/time continuum shuffling may never become more than the sum of its parts.	I relate to most movies by thinking about my past. Mr. Nobody has me evaluating my future.	Mr. Nobody's narrative tangles may bedevil as much as they entertain, but its big ambitions and absorbing visuals make for an intriguing addition to director Jaco Van Dormael's filmography.
It is well-acted and written with a rigorous effort to skirt cliche, and it has the savor of real life throughout.	Devos, as Nora, does much to hold it all together with a layered performance. Almaric has powerful moments as well, notably in a climactic rambling monologue about life he delivers to the boy.	There's no ready capsule description of Kings and Queen, but its fluid, dynamic approach to melodrama and two compelling central performances create an impressive portrait of intertwined lives.	Kings and Queen is a marvelously textured and civilized study of two tormented souls finding redemption not in each other, but in themselves and in other people.	An intelligent story is being told here in a very artful manner. That's quite a worthy accomplishment. I think.	A dryly comic, stylistically brave film.
Smart and challenging, it's one of the best movies of the year.	Great cast but the script meanders and ends up nowhere.	Mr. Cianfrance's artistic vision catapults it above the limitations of contrivance and into a realm of constantly evolving shifts of tone and mood.	My admiration for Cianfrance is all the greater for the melodramatic risks he's willing to take, whether or not every last one of them pays off.	With wonderfully drawn -- and acted -- characters, it becomes an engrossing and compelling drama built on a powerful sense of emotion.	Ambitious to a fault, The Place Beyond the Pines finds writer/director Derek Cianfrance reaching for -- and often grasping -- thorny themes of family, fatherhood, and fate.
In the mood for two glossy hours of adolescent yearning and buff, shirtless dudes? Then this movie is for you!	This second bite is stale.	Entertaining for what it is and the alpha male werewolves end up being a lot more fun than the brooding, moody vampires.	Robert Pattinson and his stomach cramps - I mean, aching unrequited love - are less oppressive, but the trade off is Taylor Lautner and his relentless shirtlessness.	New Moon is only after the affectation of emotion, of swoon-worthy poses and faux-momentous aesthetics.	The Twilight Saga's second installment may satisfy hardcore fans of the series, but outsiders are likely to be turned off by its slow pace, relentlessly downcast tone, and excessive length.
The product of marketing genius, but at its core, this movie is entirely true to A.A. Milne's wonderful storybook intentions.	Their charm is undeniable, though it mainly resides in the source material: the late 60s, when these were made, were Disney's darkest days for craft and commitment.	Quaint and fairly lovable kiddie adventures.	[Blu-ray Review] Lush and lovely to look at with a number of solid extras, "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" on Blu-ray is easily recommended for both the young and the young at heart.	What a peculiar genius was A.A. Milne Milne's distinctive voice retains its quality in with a clarity and integrity exceeding that of any other author Disney adapted.	Perhaps the most faithful of Disney's literary adaptations, this cute, charming collection of episodes captures the spirit of A.A. Milne's classic stories.
Of a piece with Nicole Holofcener's three other films -- talky, urbane ensemble flicks that elicit quiet but deeply sincere smiles and laughs, and just as often showcase hushed moments of pinprick vulnerability.	Listening to the banter in Please Give feels like eavesdropping on natural conversations, shaped and selected by a skilled storyteller.	Touching: that's what makes Holofcener's films so lovely. They are beady-eyed satires, sure, but they're also fundamentally kind-hearted.	Hardly a treasure, but it offers some modest rewards.	There are laughs and moments of pain and many instances of embarrassing (and deeply human) behavior throughout, but there's also delicacy and grace...	Nicole Holofcener's newest might seem slight in places, but its rendering of complex characters in a conflicted economic landscape is varied, natural, and touching all the same.
...a sadistically silly spoof that uses a cheesy ray gun to blow away the tropes of science-fiction past.	It has a silly juvenile appeal in its unrelenting and subversive camp satire of the pop culture scene.	A skewed marriage of mainstream pop and Burton's own eccentricity	A knowing and loving tribute to those cheesy B-movies.	There is plenty of imagination in Mars Attack!, but the ideas prickle rather than tickle.	Tim Burton's alien invasion spoof faithfully recreates the wooden characters and schlocky story of cheesy '50s sci-fi and Ed Wood movies -- perhaps a little too faithfully for audiences.
Well acted but merely a competent police drama with family overtones.	Heartfelt performances from all the leads, certainly. Top 80s tunes and a thrilling car chase in the pouring rain.	A world shrouded by danger, suspicion, and family disloyalty comprised of commonplace characters brought to life by exceptional actors.	Gray's skill with meting out suspense pays considerable dividends.	We Own the Night is defiantly, refreshingly unhip.	Bland characters, clichéd dialogue and rickety plotting ensure We Own The Night never lives up to its potential.
With its inventive art direction and stunning action sequences, not to mention sophisticated hilarity and no small amount of tongue-in-cheek homo-eroticism, this may be the sci-fi space pic for the grown-ups to see this holiday season.	There is nothing in Treasure Planet we haven't seen in recent animated efforts such as "Titan AE" and Disney's own "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" . . .	Its sense of adventure is a minor saving grace in a flawed movie	Although Disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure, it feels more forced than usual.	The movie is paced with precision. Although we spend plenty of time getting to know the characters, there's never a dull moment, and the transitions from one scene to the next are particularly smart.	Though its characterizations are weaker than usual, Treasure Planet offers a fast-paced, beautifully rendered vision of outer space.
James Bond movies are like first dates with empty-headed beauty pageant contestants: you get something beautiful to look at but through the course of the evening, you find there is not much depth or substance to match.	Damned if Die Another Day doesn't score, injecting some color and verve into a series badly in need of it. The story cracks and pops unlike any of at least the past six Bond movies.	To appreciate just how well done it is, compare it to the dumbed-down ersatz Bond of XXX. Die Another Day has style and at least a veneer of sophistication.	Die Another Day delivers pretty much everything you could comfortably expect from a Bond movie.	The new movie lacks something, a special something.	Its action may be bit too over-the-top for some, but Die Another Day is lavishly crafted and succeeds in evoking classic Bond themes from the franchise's earlier installments.
Another winner from writer/director Tom Tykwer.	A highly imaginative effort which is grounded in the reality of being disturbed.	Isn't as playful and giddy as Run Lola Run, but ... it may stick to your ribs longer.	Ultra-slick, but ultimately shallow.	An overlong, overdirected mess, which is only sporadically watchable.	More slow-moving than Run Lola Run, this film nonetheless offers an intriguing storyline about love and fate.
... an important movie that captures the beginning of modern India in scenes of Gandhi preaching his message of freedom.	It could really use a dose of Fire's heat.	The film is lovely in the way Satyajit Ray's films are lovely. It sees poverty and deprivation as a condition of life, not an exception to it, and finds beauty in the souls of its characters.	Succeeds in its central goal: to turn a forgotten class of women into real, memorable human beings who deserve a different life.	Every moment that is exquisite here... is tinged with a profound melancholy... For every beautiful moment... there is an ugly counterpart...	This compassionate work of social criticism is also luminous, due to both its lyrical imagery and cast.
Why make a Disney cartoon and take all the fun out of it?	Fine for kids; just don't expect a history lesson.	Any damage such revisionist history may impose on young minds is offset by the honestly inspiring thoughts Pocahontas offers.	Not only historically dubious, but the dullest Disney animation for years.	...being away from its high-powered predecessors, it has marched on well on its own.	Pocahontas means well, and has moments of startling beauty, but it's largely a bland, uninspired effort, with uneven plotting and an unfortunate lack of fun.
In drawing out his effects, Amenabar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance.	The spookiest movie since 'The Sixth Sense.'	The acting is fine all around. Kidman makes for a hair-raising neurotic, and the child actors give subtly nuanced performances.	One of the year's best films.	Actually had me wrapped up in the progress of its story and the fate of its heroine.	The Others is a spooky thriller that reminds us that a movie doesn't need expensive special effects to be creepy.
Entirely suspenseful, extremely well-paced and ultimately... dare I say, entertaining!	What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron, deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence.	Splashes its drama all over the screen, subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured, but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings.	A reasonably efficient mechanism, but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided.	Not really bad so much as distasteful: We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers.	With its plot about child kidnapping and endangerment, Trapped is an exploitative thriller, more queasy than suspenseful.
Greenberg seems down-to-earth and likable, and director Aviva Kempner slips in just enough baseball history for nonfans to follow Greenberg's story without getting bogged down in diamond minutiae.	Through its carefully researched and selected film clips, it reveals a lot about what America was all about in the early 20th century.	The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is informative and fun and one doesn't have to be a baseball expert to appreciate its fervor and genial charm.	Kempner's lighthearted yet not apolitical collage conveys how Greenberg's success as an athlete in the 30s and 40s contradicted an ethnic stereotype.	A warmly human look at the career of major-league baseball's most famous Jewish star.	The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is an affectionate, often very funny portrait of a baseball pioneer.
The film is smartly done and suited for family viewing.	Dedicated to helping kids make a transition, smoothing the way between Boy's Life readers and Maxim readers.	While lacking the zip and imagination of Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids movies, Cody Banks is an amiable enough mixture of James Bond-lite adventure and chaste teenage romance.	Zwart pulls out enough stops in action sequences involving jet-propelled skateboards, stunt drives and mountain rescues to keep the ball rolling nicely.	Will kids enjoy this? Well, does a child like candy?	Should satisfy young teens, but offers nothing new for those who are familiar with the formula.
[A] derivative, plot-hole ridden sci-fi flick, redeemed only by the blazing star-in-the-making quality of Vin Diesel.	A noisy, nightmarish waste of time and money, the producers' and yours.	If Pitch Black is a likable sci-fi thriller, it's because it has the heart of a cheeseball '70s disaster movie beneath the horror trappings of computer-generated mutant bats and winged demon aliens.	A solid creature feature, but not at all a revelatory one.	Flawed and ambitious, Pitch Black's murky challenge to SF-action heroic conventions is its most redeeming feature.	Despite an interesting premise (and a starmaking turn from Vin Diesel), Pitch Black is too derivative and formulaic to fully recommend to sci-fi or action fans.
In Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, we have made contact with the aliens, and they want you to call your mom.	La escena final es una de las secuencias más poderosas que se han filmado jamás...	Its discussion of passion and obsession, regret and reconciliation is consistently challenging and offers few easy answers.	...addictive, serenely maddening	A visionary science-fiction film that takes us on a profound voyage into both outer and inner space.	Solaris is a haunting, meditative film that uses sci-fi to raise complex questions about humanity and existence.
Moves along briskly, with several laugh-out-loud moments.	If you don't have a family of believable Jewish characters to begin with, the whole thing falls apart.	There's nothing subtle about Pelegri and Harari's culture-clash romp, but it's sometimes frantically funny.	It lets frantic get so far ahead of funny, the latter gets lost in the dust.	not very funny and mildly antisemitic	A cheerfully energetic screwball comedy, Only Human milks laughs from its culture-clash premise.
It's impassive, impressive stuff from Kaurismäki, who creates a heart-warming tale set against his nation's blighted economy.	The director has found a way to make an amusing fable about the costs and possibilities of freedom.	Offers a surprisingly touching and simple story about human dignity in the most trying of circumstances.	Full of deadpan humor.	To vindicate a much-maligned term, it's a nice picture.	Kaurismהki delivers another droll comedy full of his trademark humor.
Matthew McConaughey carries The Lincoln Lawyer with sheer credible willpower and personality. McConaughey has to survive fitful direction and a choppy script, but he emerges with his likeable faculties intact.	Some fussy directorial touches don't seriously get in the way of a tricky plot with a suspenseful denouement and there's an excellent use of locations in the Los Angeles area.	[VIDEO] Michael Connelly's spin-off mystery book series provides the basis for a sturdy but rushed legal thriller.	Fans of well-regarded gavel-pounders like Jagged Edge and Primal Fear will enjoy this one as well.	While it sticks to the courtroom thriller formula, this is an entertaining ride thanks to a terrific screenplay and Matthew McConaughey's magnetic lead performance.	It doesn't offer any twists on the predictable courtroom thriller formula, but with a charming Matthew McConaughey leading its solid cast, The Lincoln Lawyer offers briskly enjoyable entertainment.
Vacancy is a no-nonsense, no ambition thriller, but sometimes that's more than enough to please.	This stripped-down chiller has some decent jump-frights, but a dearth of memorable moments.	Watered down studio schlock.	[Director Nimrod] Antal does such a good job that you almost overlook the absurdities built into the screenplay.	Vacancy may not be the most wholly original thriller but it has some heart to it and is directed with gritty, old school style by Nimród Antal. Coupled with the good work done by the leads, Vacancy is worth checking into.	Vacancy's restraint with gore is commendable, the thin characters and B-movie cliches less so.
...while "Tabloid" is undeniably entertaining, hilarious at times, it is also a little troubling...	A wild and weird Errol Morris documentary about the stories we tell ourselves to cope with life's disappointments.	Errol Morris' Tabloid is bonkers in all the best possible ways -- a welcome return to perverse portraiture after a lengthy sojourn in the realm of more serious-minded subjects.	Operates as both an examination of the dominating media mentality at the time and an embodiment of it, no less keen on delving into the juicy details now as tabloid rags were then.	Gotcha sleaze, bondage, lapsed libido and sacred Mormon underwear. And no different from trotting out the disfigured for amusement, at circuses of thankfully bygone days. More to the point, what in the world happened to Errol Morris? Tabloid, indeed.	It's far from his most thought-provoking work, but Tabloid finds Errol Morris as smart, spirited, and engaging as ever.
A quirky, weirdly funny tale with an underlying layer of deep melancholy, about the fragility not only of art but of the human psyche.	That Fassbender plays the role of the disguised rocker fits well with the movie's tone: putting one of the biggest actors in Hollywood behind a mask lends a further rebellious streak to an already sardonic film.	A functioning, funny, weirdly touching fable of artistic angst and aspiration, a meditation on fame and its terrors and the metaphoric usefulness of masks and huge fake heads.	The film's desire to reduce its cultural and artistic conflicts to simple one-on-one propositions gives the film a know-it-all air of superiority, likes it's the worst kind of rock snob journalism.	It's heavier than a comedy about a gibberish-spewing guy in a giant head ought to be, but that's what makes it a thing of heartbreaking, oddball beauty.	Funny, clever, and endearingly unusual, Frank transcends its quirky trappings with a heartfelt -- and surprisingly thought-provoking -- story.
You feel as if you're being smothered in cotton candy by a director obsessed with infantility and who cannot bear to face the reality of childhood.	In The Sandlot's nostalgia for simpler times, a single-sex world seems to be a key component.	Ever since Stand by Me, it seems that every Boy's Own yarn is deemed incomplete without a nostalgic, pseudo-ironic voice-over waxing lyrical about the mythology of short pants and acne.	If you can accept "The Sandlot" on its own terms, as a sentimental, nostalgic look at growing up... you'll have fun. More importantly, young audiences will have fun.	A solid double rather than a grand slam, The Sandlot remains a refreshing antidote to the daily round of contract squabbles on the sports page.	It may be shamelessly derivative and overly nostalgic, but The Sandlot is nevertheless a genuinely sweet and funny coming-of-age adventure.
The filmmaking duo of Joel and Ethan Coen turn in yet another of their mini-classics with this dark-humored drama of debt, ransom and murder.	Gunderson (Frances McDormand) [is] the most endearing, hilarious and wholly feminine heroine since Thelma or Louise.	One of those rare pictures about which I have nothing negative to say.	You have to grant the Coens their due as creators of suspense, mood and plotting, and for their ability to color the most monstrous crimes with an undeniably funny sense of the absurd.	[Marge is] a good cop because everything abnormal stands out like a stain against her white-on-white sanity.... [H]er incomprehension [of criminality] is not only her strength as a detective, it justifies the deadpan style of the movie.	Violent, quirky, and darkly funny, Fargo delivers an original crime story and a wonderful performance by McDormand.
A deeply moving film.	The movie is too conventional and fictionalized to qualify as a genuine political epic, but it's emotionally touching in describing the friendship between the NY Times reporter and his Cambodian translator.	The director, Roland Joffe, and his photographer, Chris Menges, capture all of this with a realism that hasn't been so poetically convincing in a nondocumentary context since Gillo Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers.	Powerful, unsettling, factual; Oscar caliber acting all around.	If you see no more than one film a year, make this the one for 1984.	Artfully composed, powerfully acted, and fueled by a powerful blend of anger and empathy, The Killing Fields is a career-defining triumph for director Roland Joffé and a masterpiece of American cinema.
For a robust action story about three people from very different backgrounds attempting to make a positive influence on their world, "Hancock" is a step in the right direction.	The attempts to deepen the emotions turn Hancock into a strange, conflicted and often joyless film.	If Will Smith can pull off this hodgepodge of a movie, an ill-conceived poorly executed effort that tries to be all things to all people, then he really is Hollywood's most bankable star.	A new movie that makes the previous pandemonium seem downright restrained.	Hancock isn't by any means a dead loss, but it could have been a lot better.	Though it begins with promise, Hancock suffers from a flimsy narrative and poor execution.
A film brimming with good intentions that, unfortunately, lacks conviction.	A slickly produced slice of sentimental hokum that borrows freely from a half-dozen or so other, better feel-good fantasies.	This predictable Christmas pudding actually possesses a little flavor, thanks almost entirely to its key performers.	A holiday film Joe Lieberman could love, unembarrassed by its wholesome, sugary pro-family message.	Nicolas Cage is at his best coping with crisis situations, even dirty diapers, less comfortable with warm, cuddly moments, and Tea Leoni is radiant and lovely, breathing life into a role that could have been one-dimensional.	Despite good performances by Cage and especially by Leoni, The Family Man is too predictable and derivative to add anything new to the Christmas genre. Also, it sinks under its sentimentality.
A minor film with major pleasures from Portuguese master Manoel de Oliviera...	The movie is a trove of delights.	Ample proof of the director's great wit and wisdom.	Oliveira trusts the intelligence of his audience...In the life of the city he suggests the ongoing life of humanity, the context in which individual mortality must be contemplated.	Speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life.	I'm Going Home is a masterfully subtle and poignant exploration of mortality.
Some call it torture porn, others might call it aggressive moralising, more still have say it's boring and pointless. In my view this level of dissent marks it as worthwhile.	it turns out to be concerned precisely with the nature and reception of extremity, posing uncomfortable questions about what it is that one really seeks in choosing to 'witness' scenes of horrific human abjection.	MARTYRS is this year's INSIDE, both films are legendary in their own right... The only negative thing about Laugier's film is that once you see it, you'll never be able to see it for the first time ever again...	Martyrs is a five star example of what modern horror can do, or a one star mugging of all that is decent. Forgive us if we go with the former.	Film should score OK with hardcore gore fans, but others will expect martyrdom for sticking it out until the end.	A real polarising movie, this Gallic torture-porn is graphic, brutal, nasty and gruesome and not to everyone's taste.
Makes a surprisingly convincing case for Dante and Randal as characters worthy of a revisit once a decade.	Another raunchily funny, mildly sad and brutally candid purging of [Smith's] demons and dreams.	Smith has nothing original left to say and no original ways left to say it.	wonderfully oddball	Though it will be of little interest to anyone who has never seen its predecessor, Clerks II should delight Smith's fans.	Clerks II dishes up much of the graphic humor and some of the insight that made the 1994 original a cult hit.
More than anything I've seen from Hollywood lately, City of Angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look.	I highly recommend watching the original, instead of this dud.	Substitutes brutal violence and gore for character development, probably hoping audiences won't notice what a confusing nightmare this whole mess really is.	Even for teens hooked on the grandiloquence of death-metal masochism, the movie may seem closer to an endless Sunday in church.	Vincent Perez is game, but he--nor anyone involved in this sloppy production--can erase the fond memories of the late Brandon Lee.	The Crow: City of Angels is a sloppy pretender that captures neither the mood nor energy of the original.
Comic choreography, nimble filmmaking and trenchant jokes. A masterpiece.	It's much like a silent movie, following in the giant footsteps of Chaplin and Keaton.	His mechanical monsters are more annoying than harmful and the beings who control and are controlled by them are not villains and victims but, invariably, innocents as guileless as they are hapless.	This film delivers exactly what its title promises. It's a panoramic frenzy of elaborate sights and sound design.	A film comedy directed with the grace of a ballet, the painstaking detail of an action painting and the affection of a love song...	A remarkable achievement, Playtime's packs every scene with sight gags and characters that both celebrates and satirizes the urbanization of modern life.
Ferrell doesn't give his typical over-the-top performance here, but rather creates a terrific, understated character that produces a huge amount of empathy and likeability.	The picture is an overworked trifle: There's so much going on in it that it becomes hard to care about anything that's going on in it.	Never self-consciously wacky or cloyingly sentimental, Stranger Than Fiction is instead a breezy, sweet comedy.	This creative film presents a whimsical story that entertains us while also making us think about our own mortality and what's important in life.	Stranger Than Fiction is subversive in its own, low-key way.	A fun, whimsical tale about an office drone trying to save his life from his narrator, Stranger Than Fiction features a subdued performances from Will Ferrell that contributes mightily to its quirky, mind-bending affect.
A fine cast produces a surprisingly low-key outing. It sports a plot like a Western from 45 years ago, but pacing familiar from LONESOME DOVE.	Old-fashioned Western features great performances.	Hardly a fresh perspective on genre traditions, it's still got the performances and glorious landscapes to win you over.	If a western is going to be this slow, it needs to have a lot more tension, and deeper meaning, than this one.	It isn't a bad film, but the pacing drags it down to the level of just another horse opera when it could have been so much more.	A traditional genre western, Appaloosa sets itself apart with smart psychology, an intriguing love triangle, and good chemistry between the leads.
Might be the least-sexy film about a hedonist ever made, unless bawdy and bewigged somehow add up to erotic.	Plain and simple, The Libertine is Depp's effort to pull a Charlize: defined as a preternaturally gorgeous actor attempting to portray a visibly repulsive person for award-worthy attention.	The cheesed-up life and times of one John Wilmot, the Second Earl of Rochester.	"The Libertine" in question here is John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, a poet and member of the Reformation court of King Charles II.	This is an irritatingly unsatisfying and unappetizing profile.	Despite Johnny Depp's zealous performance, muddled direction and murky cinematography hinder The Libertine.
Midnight Cowboy is quite a film and one that looms as an adult attraction of truly blockbuster proportions.	I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film.	I appreciate the performances by Jon Voight, as Joe Buck, and Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo, as well as their relationship.	Classic Oscar winner has explicit material, mature themes.	Midnight Cowboy (1969) is an ultra-realistic film (shot on location) with sordid, downbeat and serious content. It portrays the unlikely companionship	John Schlesinger's gritty, unrelentingly bleak look at the seedy underbelly of urban American life is undeniably disturbing, but Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight's performances make it difficult to turn away.
By simply re-creating what he has observed, Bujalski has created a tender, funny and stealthily affecting portrait of youthful powerlessness and frustration.	Smart, subtle and excruciatingly honest.	This thoroughly engaging little movie takes unexpected paths with nary a false step	Not actually that funny ha ha, but a sensitive and unforced little film about the aimlessness of post-graduate life.	The tagline says, 'This would be sad if it weren't so funny', well guess what, it's not that funny, so it must be sad.	This modest, unpretentious character study astutely captures the emotional states of the 20-something slacker.
Director George Ratliff plays pitch-perfect on the tautly wound strings of our innermost fears that nothing -- not love, wealth or intelligence -- can protect us from the monsters we harbor.	The nerve-shattering ending will have you hugging your children when you get home - but only if there are witnesses present.	It's the carnival-fun-house kind of entertainment: genuinely creepy in some places, giggly in other places, and sometimes both at the same time.	Perhaps the scariest thing about Joshua was the feeling I got at the end that I had just sat through some kind of weird gay panic movie.	Ultimately predictable.	Though Joshua is ultimately too formulaic, its intelligence and suspenseful buildup heighten the overall creep factor.
Shockingly short on suggestiveness and restraint.	One of the stupidest movies you'll ever see. Bad, bad, bad.	Director Jan de Bont, known for the razzle he put into the exciting movie Speed and the subsequent dud Twister, proves himself unable to break away from depending on dazzle to substitute for substance.	The idea that this film is supposedly based on the classic novel by Jackson is an insult to the author. The words 'insinuated by' would be more factual.	More hokey than haunting.	Sophisticated visual effects fail to offset awkward performances and an uneven script.
"So they send in the devil to do God's work," says a hulking Australian mercenary, part of the rescue attempt. "It's ironic, isn't it?" Highly ironic. The implications of that irony are not explored in the movie.	Rambo combines an unapologetic return to the grand action-movie tradition of blowing **** up with a Saw-era interest in close-ups of human viscera. The problem is that the moral meaning of the gore keeps changing.	A grim, hyperviolent send-off that could give you post-traumatic stress disorder.	A sloppy, ugly splatter flick.	Damned if Stallone doesn't get us rooting for Rambo to kick bad-guy butt one more time, the same way we cheered on Rocky's improbable return.	Sylvester Stallone knows how to stage action sequences, but the movie's uneven pacing and excessive violence (even for the franchise) is more nauseating than entertaining.
Touching and funny, with an unforgettable ending that could not have been better if it were fiction. One of the best films of the year.	You needn't be a fan of rock and roll to be both amused and moved by this documentary...a winningly bittersweet little film.	One of those rare documentaries that begins right and ends even better, providence endowing an already compelling project with even more remarkable real-life twists and turns along the way to a conclusion that rivals even the most imaginative fiction.	Makes for a modestly touching journey.	The best advertisement for the Mormon faith since My Ten Wives.	Arthur Kane is a fascinating subject in what ultimately proves to be a touching, bittersweet documentary.
A fascinating film.	This might just be the perfect time to soak up some of its calm and natural beauty.	So gorgeous you'd swear it was art-directed by whoever puts together the spare, tasteful Pottery Barn catalog.	The most intriguing aspect of The Vertical Ray of the Sun is its setting of Hanoi.	Tear yourself away from the hit parade that so often punishes us, and take adult time for the exquisite gratifications of The Vertical Ray of the Sun. This ray fills more than the screen.	The Vertical Ray of the Sun is gorgeously, poetically composed, lulling the viewer into its story of everyday life.
Boasting ten-dimensional characters and the sophisticated juggling of difficult themes, Ball's powerful, complex movie is a must-see.	The film is pretty unfocused and rambling. Some good performances can't overcome those flaws or the film's sudden, jarring changes in the tone.	[Ball] succeeds admirably and with dramatic force, blending themes of racism, liberalism, emotional betrayal, abuse, hate speech and pedophilia into a confronting adult drama peppered with shocks and black humour.	Ball has found an insinuating, perversely smooth tone in his script, but his less-adept direction inadvertently adds dissonance.	An empty provocation that's about as classy and subtle as its title.	This story of politics, race and, sexual awakening has moments that pack a punch, but overall, Towelhead never quite achieves the nuance of helmer Alan Ball's television work.
Totally cliched and nearly two hours long, pic takes forever to get to hopelessly obvious places.	Sweet, amiable and often unexpectedly funny.	The realism clashes with the princess-fantasy story.	There's only one way The Prince and Me could be any worse - it could have starred Kate Hudson.	It's not torture, it's actually sort of fun for long stretches--a shame that The Prince & Me squanders all that good will in its desire to be ordinary.	A bland, fluffy, and predictable bit of wish fulfillment.
Paltrow gives the first credible evidence since Emma that her career may last.	Once the movie throws in a jolting, late-in- the-game plot twist that could have been borrowed from City of Angels, it never regains its balance.	A clever and satisfying comedy that comes as a blissful relief from more high-minded festival fare.	Howitt's story stalls at that point, and from there on things quickly devolve into soap opera-like melodrama, with some disappointing character revelations and a preposterous ending.	This should go down a storm with folks who still cherish the hope that the solution to all their problems is just around the corner or in the next lift.	Despite the gimmicky feel of the split narratives, the movie is watch-able due to the winning performances by the cast.
The film gets much better in its second half when it becomes an "Ocean's Eleven" type adventure featuring many faces that will instantly be familiar to "Fast/Furious" fans.	A giant overdose of testosterone mixed with soap opera for muscleheads and gearheads.	That force of chaotic and unsatisfiable desire that Freud called the id is much closer to the surface in a movie like "Fast Five" than ever before in action-cinema history, and part of Lin's peculiar genius is that he barely tries to conceal it.	Dom and O'Connor repeat the urban ethnic mythology that started with James Cagney and Pat O'Brien in 1930s gangster films at Warner Bros. studios, but update realities to include contemporary, post-Civil Rights-era race-mixing.	This episode has the highest velocity and lowest IQ yet. See it on the biggest, loudest, dumbest screen you can find.	Sleek, loud, and over the top, Fast Five proudly embraces its brainless action thrills and injects new life into the franchise.
Ang Lee's latest, Lust, Caution is a sluggish disappointment with a catchy title.	Though his direction is unsurprisingly beautiful, the settings lush and the performances wonderful, no one apparently had the guts to insist Lee streamline his rambling story.	By the time [Lee] gets to the lust, it is too late to throw caution to the winds.	While some will feel his previous works better illustrate his gift of film, Lust, Caution creates an unmatched statement of cinematic wisdom all its own.	A sumptuous and exceptional spy story.	Ang Lee's Lust, Caution is a tense, sensual and beautifully-shot espionage film.
One plot twist provides a creative respite from the rehash barrage, but this Cave is better explored on DVD.	The Cave is a rare find, a film that is pure formula, yet impossible to follow.	so-so... delivers a couple of jolts before the dopey finale, which takes place in a steamy, flame-filled cavern that looks alarmingly like Dante's Go-Go Lounge.	The pretty cast gets knocked off in order of attractiveness (the least cute bite it earlier on) and the monsters and action are shot in such a way as to maximize the overall incoherence.	Look up pointless in the dictionary and you'll find a movie poster for The Cave.	Despite its stylized and impressive sets, this horror-monster movie mish-mash suffers from endless cliches and wildly implausible plotlines.
Much more than a one-trick puzzle movie the logic holds emotionally and narratively, and Shyamalan brings satisfying closure to all his characters and their sorrows.	Like The Exorcist, this isn't really a gore-spattered shocker, more a slow-burning, subconscious-botherer.	Another "could-have-been" film, another almost successful compromise, another intelligent flick done in by its misplaced and worn-out star.	Shyamalan seems to have no idea how to dramatize anything.	The Sixth Sense will convince you that spooky movies can be exciting, chilling, mysterious, and rewarding.	M Night Shayamalan's The Sixth Sense is a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture, but all the chills of a modern horror flick.
U-571 moves like a torpedo.	Demonstrates that a submarine movie needs some type of inventive subtext to keep it afloat and engaging.	U-571 is bombastic and anonymous.	This submarine flick has some tense moments and plenty of action.	Enormously entertaining.	Excellent cinematography and an interesting plot accompanied by a talented cast and crew make U-571 a tense thriller.
There are, after all, aimed at young audiences plenty of movies more mean-spirited, indiscriminate and obnoxious than The Last Legion. But at the same time there are plenty that are, alas, less frustrating.	This attempt at reimagining the Arthurian legend fails to raise the pulse due to some leaden dialogue and unconvincing performances.	We can only hope that the title of this misbegotten swords-and-sandals adventure is prophetic.	No twist is too farfetched for this Dino De Laurentiis epic.	Lots budgetary-challenged battles of the largely bloodless PG-13 stripe with folks in smelly looking leather suits and crepe hair clanging swords and saying 'Arrgh' a lot.	With miscast leads and unoriginal, uninspired dialogue, The Last Legion pales in comparison to the recent cinematic epics it invokes.
[DreamWorks Animation] has finally found their successor to the "Shrek" mantle in the hapless hero known as Po the Panda.	Gravity-defying, action-packed family comedy - it's chop-socky fun.	This is one kid's movie where the grownups shouldn't have to fight over who has to take the children. Instead, everyone should get in on the fun.	From a studio that's decimated iconic fairy tale characters with its poison pop-culture pen, i.e., Shrek, comes an age-old fable, poetic, pop-free and timeless...yet still an utter hoot.	Oh heck, this is my favorite film of the year so far -- A ! Action, depth, fun, comedy, profound messages and it's visually gorgeous.	Kung Fu Panda has a familiar message, but the pleasing mix of humor, swift martial arts action, and colorful animation makes for winning Summer entertainment.
Tony Jaa is a martial arts star. Is he a director? No. The dull plotting and predictable characters in Ong Bak: The Beginning all but overwhelms Jaa doing what he does best, which is fighting.	You can only get so mad at a movie in which a large crowd cheers and the lone subtitle reads "Hooray." With a period.	An effort that handily trumps the first in every respect, Ong-Bak 2 further cements Tony Jaa's status as one of the era's key action stars.	Taking co-directorial reins with Panna Rittikrai, Jaa has erected a portentous platform for his high-flying athleticism, bearing none of the freewheeling spirit or humor that made his feature debut a guiltless pleasure.	Don't look for continuity of storyline -- just enjoy the extravagant fight stunts, the restless camera work, and the sluicing rivers of blood and mud. (That's why you're here, right?)	It suffers from comparisons to its predecessor -- not to mention Tony Jaa's less-than-nimble direction -- but Ong Bak 2 has all the extravagant violence and playful style that fans of the original will expect.
Beautiful photography, a heartbreaking story, and iconic moments from beginnning to end. Absolutely unmissable.	This is the one that became the classic and best known Frankenstein picture.	Nothing can detract from the power of the most influential monster movie ever made.	Shocking in its day and still a genuinely creepy experience, director James Whale's primitive yet enthralling interpretation of Mary Shelley's classic tale of man playing God is the most influential genre movie ever made.	James Whale has done a great job in his direction. This is not an easy thing to direct -- just how far to go in playing upon an audience's credulity, it's sympathy, it's nerves. Whale seems to have gone far enough, but not too far.	Still unnerving to this day, Frankenstein adroitly explores the fine line between genius and madness, and features Boris Karloff's legendary, frightening performance as the monster.
Breathing new life into these old forms is a next-to-impossible mission, but if the skeletons in your closet are made of celluloid, "Super 8" will be more of a treat than a trick.	When Super 8 works, though, it really works, earnestly and without manipulation.	A combination of period science-fiction tale and coming-of-age story whose paths eventually collide in disconnected schmaltz.	As befits a Spielberg tribute, dysfunctional families come together, children come to understand their parents' travail, parents are reminded that they love their children.	Its pleasures are borrowed, but durable.	It may evoke memories of classic summer blockbusters a little too eagerly for some, but Super 8 has thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth to spare.
The original film's mix of romanticized innocence and sexual adventure has been replaced by after-school- special plot twists and puppy-love handholding.	If it was absolutely necessary to re-do "Dirty Dancing," it could be worse. Seriously.	It's just about what you'd expect from a dance movie: Not much of a plot, terrific dancing and enjoyable music.	This film is too noble to get down and dirty.	The plot of Nights will occupy only 10 or 12 brain cells.	Cheesy, unnecessary remake.
Most of it pales in comparison to Chan's earlier movies, which makes one wonder if he might be getting too old for some of the more dangerous fare he might have attempted five or ten years ago. Let's hope not.	The funniest bits are the blooper out-takes at its conclusion but, when I saw it, not that many people stayed in the theater long enough to laugh.	While it is cartoonish, it also is fun, and that is due mostly to Chan.	Rush out and catch Rush Hour.	...manages to coast on the palpable chemistry between the two leads...	A kick-ass addition to the cop-buddy film genre.
[An] absurd piece of entertaining fluff.	It's not that it's entirely bad. I liked some of the music and Whitney Houston's singing.	The movie does contain a love story, but it's the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight.	Feature length rock video created to sell soundtracks. Starring Kevin Costner.	Who wouldn't want Kevin Costner as their bodyguard? And Whitney can sing!	The Bodyguard is a cheesy, melodramatic potboiler with occasional moments of electricity from Whitney Houston.
This may be the funniest, most faithful adaptation of any classic television series ever.	Bringing the cartoon characters into the real world requires a wild imagination. Credit scriptwriter Kenneth Lonergan for having it.	It's not a classic. But it's also nothing that the late Jay Ward, who developed the characters more than 40 years ago, would be ashamed of, either.	So unrelentingly bad on so many levels.	The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is completely in the spirit of its progenitor.	Though the film stays true to the nature of the original cartoon, the script is disappointing and not funny.
A witty, sad, informed view of obsession, submission and the sex industry.	mostly limp drama aimed for a gay audience.	Those in search of a film about gay men disillusioned in Hollywood with a better script and more dramatic heft should rent Gods And Monsters or Thom Fitzgerald's Beefcake.	The whole package would have played better if the movie had bothered answering some of the questions it delicately raises.	For the most part a disarming, charming, and frequently cynical exercise in mordant humor.	Though it begins promisingly enough, The Fluffer eventually descends into melodrama.
A sour, empty graphic novel of an escapade from the man who once helmed 'Atonement,' 'Hanna' gets intensely more godawful as it approaches its climax.	Wright combines his two genres into a stylish exercise that perversely includes some sentiment and insight.	Ronan has developed into quite a force to be reckoned with, and proves such a strong and hypnotic lead that she almost outshines her older co-stars, Bana and Blanchett.	Bad-A**!	Wright has crafted a dreamy-looking and exciting film that works as much as a moving coming of age story as it does a bone-crunching action thriller.	Fantastic acting and crisply choreographed action sequences propel this unique, cool take on the revenge thriller.
[Shane] Meadows' fictionalized version of these events is at least as vivid -- and at times as hard to watch -- as some of Ken Loach's more stark dramas.	Meadows gets great, moving performances from his young cast.	A successfully executed cautionary tale condemning war and racism in the context of growing up in cloudy Northern England	This Is England is a movie like a punch to the solar plexus.	The best British film of the year. You'll be floored.	A moving coming-of-age tale that captures the despair among England's working-class youth in the 1980s.
This silly, satirical comedy glides in, skating on thin ice.	It's Ferrell who does most of the heavy lifting...[and] kudos to costume designer Weiss whose clothes get laughs both on and off the ice.	A true ice queen sandwich!	Equal parts inspiration, perspiration and hairspray, Blades of Glory is silly and enjoyable but not as consistently funny as Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Ferrell's last sports spoof.	Blades of Glory is only slightly less funny -- if you ask ignorant old me -- than watching real figure skating. It's your coin.	Thanks to the spirited performances of a talented cast - particularly Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as rivals-turned-teammates -- Blades of Glory successfully spoofs inspirational sports dramas with inspired abandon.
A new millennium hybrid of Dangerous Minds and Hoosiers.	It qualifies its thrill of victory with a very sober message: few high school athletes become NBA millionaires, many are cheated out of an education.	"...one of the best films of its genre."	Either real life is becoming more like a movie, or sports movies inspired by a true story exist in their own form of reality.	Saved by bursts of energy and inventiveness.	Even though it's based on a true story, Coach Carter is pretty formulaic stuff, but it's effective and energetic, thanks to a strong central performance from Samuel L. Jackson.
Until it becomes simply a hostage dilemma, the film maintains an uneasy air of mystery and suspicion.	Expected ironies about homeland security, racial profiling, and fears of the Other land like a rain of anvils, and director Renfroe matches Krause's worked-up performance with a jiggly, flashy approximation of off-brand Tony Scott.	It does build up considerable suspense and tension; Renfroe has learned well from Hitchcock.	Civic Duty does engage and get your pulse racing.	With nowhere for any of the characters to go, literally, the story becomes a tendentious exercise in belaboring a point.	At times a tense and provocative thriller, Civic Duty struggles to move beyond its one-note premise.
While likable enough, the movie proves a curiously pallid, choppy mixture of farce and sentiment that doesn't take full advantage of what the stars have to offer.	There is some harmless pleasure to be found when feathers aren't ruffled, when the fowl is not foul.	Failing even to attempt genuinely humorous gags or scenarios, and incapable of conveying the thrill of its obsessive pastime or the majesty of the animals themselves, this feel-good male weepie remains comedically and dramatically grounded.	A comedy with fewer laughs than measles.	What's next? A movie about people watching TV?	Though made with care and affection for its characters, The Big Year plods along, rarely reaching any comedic heights.
It's a bad joke.	A paint-by-numbers type of film.	The resulting dynamics, while producing some jovial flow and engaging tension, tend toward a somewhat tottering balance.	Center Stage doesn't make much sense when the characters aren't dancing.	Center Stage isn't going to live forever.	Critics say that if you're willing to suffer through soap opera-like dialogue and plot to see some excellent dancing, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you might be better off renting Fame.
It's predictable, it's overacted, it's little more than a longer version of the TV show -- and it's a guaranteed hit among loyal fans of the fictional pop star.	As critic-proof as they come, Hannah Montana: The Movie is sure to delight the tweenagers who adore the Disney Channel series.	Cyrus has maintained an honorably wholesome image, and this feature-length spinoff of the sitcom does nothing to hurt it. But it also does nothing to help Cyrus or the audience evolve.	The Easter Bunny will have to share the weekend spotlight with 16-year-old pop culture sensation Miley Cyrus. This movie will touch your heart and provide surprises as you watch this country girl just having fun.	The movie repeatedly knocks Miley down a peg and humiliates her whenever she expresses an interest in blooming into international sensation Hannah full-time.	While youthful Miley fans won't complain, Hannah Montana the Movie is little more than a formulaic Disney Channel episode stretched thin.
Wait till it's out on video. Then borrow it.	The lack of emotion is glaring!	It's a nifty enough film that's entertaining but not comparable to the original 'Star Wars.'	It's a scam.	Too bad writer-director Lucas left out the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out memorable characters. He left out the fun.	Lucas needs to improve on the plot and character development, but there's plenty of eye candy to behold.
Superman is thrown in to the mix somewhere. But he's merely an after thought, and a supporting player in his own film.	Anyone who has been following the Superman saga will find this installment enjoyable enough, but some of the magic is missing.	One of the most underrated movies of all time. Seriously.	Not bad. Fun bizarro scenes and the Clark/Superman fight rules.	There was a day when Richard Lester was a great filmmaker. It was before this.	When not overusing sight gags, slapstick, and Richard Pryor, Superman III resorts to plot points rehashed from the previous Superman flicks.
A bittersweet, marvelously effective end of a certain goofy era, when friends banding together were enough to save the world.	The first 30 minutes had me hooked but when it turned into an over-the-top mashup of a sci-fi alien invasion flick you lost me, guys. Geeks will flock but so what?	I pretty much unreservedly loved The World's End, whose compact dramatic structure and steady flow of good jokes puts most mainstream American comedies-too often loosely bundled collections of hit-or-miss sketches-to shame.	Besides closing on a downbeat final note - as opposed to Shaun and Fuzz's ebullient endings - this is a good old time at the movies, the kind only a born filmmaker can provide.	Wright and Pegg now sry their sights on the subject of nostalgic obsession itself.	Madcap and heartfelt, Edgar Wright's apocalypse comedy The World's End benefits from the typically hilarious Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, with a plethora of supporting players.
The most fascinating aspect of Overnight is that it actually lends The Boondock Saints a measure of depth.	It's an unacknowledged indictment of a system of agents, managers, hangers-on and production executives that automatically equates arrogance and bad-boy behavior with bottomless talent, no questions asked.	A hilarious and harrowing cautionary tale.	By the end of this cautionary tale, you feel like you've seen a guy get a shot at the big time and end up nowhere, a fate he richly deserves.	Tony Montana and Mark Brian Smith's acidic, vitriolic takedown of Duffy boasts the abrasive intensity of a migraine headache and the depth and scope of a bona fide American tragedy.	This absorbing but wince-inducing documentary is a cautionary tale about the costs of hubris in the world of indie film.
Like Crash without the clunky characterization, Rabbit Hole is film as medicine, a big, pretty pill to be uncomfortably swallowed.	There's a lot of beauty to be mined from that depressing-sounding scenario, thanks to well-drawn characters, impeccable performances, and sensitive direction.	It might be that this material is simply better suited to the theater, with its enforced artificiality and its crackling, dragging blacks.	This year's feel-bad holiday drama is an equivalent of "Revolutionary Road" crossed with "Reservation Road," but is nowhere effective as either.	Here the proceedings are so lifeless that you find yourself rooting for the narrative to fully tread into the disaster zones with which it flirts.	It's often painful to watch, but Rabbit Hole's finely written script and convincing performances make it worth the effort.
Repeatedly falling in the same pile of dog poop got the most laughs at our screening.	George Gallo, who wrote and directed the recent action comedy Doubletake, is one of the writers of See Spot Run, and his signature is all over this silly affair.	Eight-year-olds will undoubtedly be on the floor when this scene is over, but every slapstick sequence feels like an uninspired retread of less potty-minded kiddie fare from the Disney live-action movie-mill of the '60s and '70s.	To explain the extreme, lingering stench of See Spot Run, it might be helpful to think of the movie itself as a dog.	By the time the film ends, everyone -- and I mean everyone -- has been humiliated, abused, and generally reduced to Gordon's level of inanity.	See Spot Run has all the elements chidren enjoy in a movie: a lovable dog, bad things happening to stupid adults, and lots of dog poop. For adults, it's either hit-or-miss.
Even in the world of the digitally perfect, a black man seems doomed to be a disposable sidekick, and the heroine must represent every feminist ideal at once.	Final Fantasy works better as a 2-hour demo reel than as movie, a showcase of what we can do and what we can do better.	For all its capacity for follicular detail, this cool new technology has trouble with intimacy.	It's quite a blast.	Despite its strong visual appeal, Final Fantasy alienates the audience with strange theories that go unexplained, and characters that rival Pinocchio's reality.	The movie raises the bar for computer animated movies, but the story is dull and emotionally removed.
Because of its heart and spirit, Straight Outta Compton is even for some of those who don't know the difference between Ice Cube and Ice-T.	"Straight Outta Compton," F. Gary Gray's biopic of pioneering gangsta rappers N.W.A., manages to feel urgent and alive, even as it plays like the coolest episode of VH1's "Behind the Music" ever.	You can't get more current or more electric than Straight Outta Compton.	A fitting tribute to the world's most dangerous group and easily one of my favorite films of the year.	It's very easy to imagine sing-along showings cropping up for years to come.	Straight Outta Compton is a biopic that's built to last, thanks to F. Gary Gray's confident direction and engaging performances from a solid cast.
Lee has cast his film with the cream of rising actors.	Sustains a standard of realism that can induce extraordinary tension.	Schamus, mightily adapting from Daniel Woodrell's equally blood-soaked and far more delusional novel, Woe To Live On, has revised the book's revisionism to restore to the war its fighters' freewheeling single-mindedness.	A film that would inspire useful discussion in a history class, but for ordinary moviegoers, it's slow and forbidding.	The film is less than the sum of its parts.	A well-acted, eccentric Civil War film, Ang Lee's Ride With the Devil is often more visually striking than it is emotionally engaging.
Ferrell at the top of his craft...	It solidifies Ferrell's place alongside Jim Carrey, Jack Black and, when called on, Johnny Depp, as our best comic actors.	It's nearly perfect.	Isn't as strong as Dodgeball or Starsky and Hutch primarily because the satire inherent in these flicks isn't paid as much attention to this time around.	A lot of the time it's very funny.	Filled with inspired silliness and quotable lines, Anchorman isn't the most consistent comedy in the world, but Will Ferrell's buffoonish central performance helps keep this portrait of a clueless newsman from going off the rails.
However was this singularly tuneless show a hit in the first place?	There's bad and then there's bad and then there's Annie	Most of the movie featured doe-eyed, orphaned girls either getting abused by a boozehound or doing manual labor	John Huston is the wrong director, lacking appreciation for the musical genre	The songs never take off into anything very much, the whole atmosphere (apart from the climax) is distinctly stagebound, and Huston merely reveals why he had never before in his long career been hired to make a musical.	John Huston proves an odd choice to direct, miring Annie in a sluggish, stagebound mess of an adaptation, but the kids are cute and the songs are memorable.
Both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy, What Time Is It There? may prove to be [Tsai's] masterpiece.	Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical, the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss.	Has moments of quiet power and others of almost slapstick charm, and it's so elegantly fashioned that it's difficult to take one's eyes from the screen.	The story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today, but be warned: It's a slow slog to get there.	Those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find What Time Is It There? well worth the time.	Though it requires patience to view, What Time Is It There?'s exploration of loneliness is both elegant and haunting.
Smith's most family-oriented, heartfelt movie ever in his varied career. Families will love it	Affleck moves from being the world's most famous scapegrace and goat into Hugh Grant territory, and he does it with surprising authority.	The problem is the subject matter: a cozy ode to fatherhood with a maudlin audacity that would make Dickens blush.	You might think you're trapped in a 'Bachelor Father' marathon...though it's hardly 'Gigli' redux, it's so mercilessly sweet and cloying that it might make you gagli.	Smith is trying to say something heartfelt, even as he's using formulas that are unworthy of him. Thus, Jersey Girl is a step, not a misstep.	A surprisingly conventional romantic comedy from Kevin Smith, Jersey Girl is warm but often overly sentimental
It's a great surprise that The Good Thief actually works, leaving Melville behind and giving us the vibrant, exciting work of another interesting director, Neil Jordan.	The times have passed this sort of film by.	The Irish filmmaker takes Melville's Gallic masterpiece about a gallant Montmartre gambler and makes it into an ordinary American neo-noir film set in the French Riviera.	A solid work of craft that doubles as a little meditation on art.	Nolte is not only made for the role, he's also rehearsed it in real life.	Bolstered by Nolte's strong performance, The Good Thief brims with seductive style.
Moss, who shoots the film himself verité-style, gets points for his on-the-ground look at the sacrifices made by those seeking a living (while leaving families behind) and at the day-to-day problems raised when merciless economic interests come into play.	"The Overnighters" is commendable for many reasons, not the least of which is the way it allows complex issues to remain complex. There is a clear conflict between the pastor and the town, but there's no good vs. evil.	Long before this unexpected development, The Overnighters has established its credentials as a beautifully crafted, multi-layered piece of storytelling, and as an important snapshot of the new Great Depression.	Moss allows the natural facets of this story to shine through, creating a gem of a documentary that's raw, honest and brutally relevant.	Is there any small town in America with its name printed on the side of its water tower that isn't going through tough times right now?	Hard-hitting, absorbing, and painfully relevant, The Overnighters offers an urgent and compassionate picture of life in 21st century America.
If the term "arthouse" usually makes you cringe, [...] you'd better stop reading this and see what else is playing.	Kiarostami is quick to stimulate the mind but not the heart; as a result he never finds a comfortable balance between intellect and emotion, leaving Copie Conforme feeling chilly and distant.	I believe the movie is ambiguous on purpose. The director is having fun playing games with the underlying reality. This bizarre highbrow film is strictly geared for art houses. It is instantly forgettable, but Binoche gives an amazing performance.	There are times when Binoche's enthusiastic embrace of this conceit verges on the loopy, but at least she is entertaining, as well as energetic, her aim being to encompass 15 years of marriage in one afternoon.	The conclusion is abrupt and unsatisfying, but the philosophical dialogue Kiarostami manages to keep aloft for well over an hour touches on intriguing questions of openness, self-honesty, and personal freedom.	The main stars are absolutely perfect in this absorbing, existential drama that dissects human relationships.
An oft told story is given stirring insight through first rate performances and production.	A fascinating, indeed shocking, study of a character warped by privilege, wealth and repressed urges.	Seated firmly in the center are a trio of dazzling performances from Channing Tatum, Steve Carell, and Mark Ruffalo, all of which make a compelling case for their career best works.	As the creepy, repressed John E. DuPont, Carell gives an excellent performance that may well earn him the awards that have already been predicted.	If you're willing to be thrown for a loop, you're in good hands with this medal-worthy cast and crew.	A chilling true crime drama, Foxcatcher offers Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo, and Channing Tatum a chance to shine -- and all three of them rise to the challenge.
Fluent, brave and touching.	Mr. Coppola has done things this fancily before, but never with so clear and moving a sense of purpose.	Bridges' riviting performance should keep the rest of you glued to your set and longing for one of his rocketship cars.	Still Coppola's best film since Apocalypse Now. It has an enthusiasm that much of his post-1970's work has lacked.	A cheerful and light approach to potentially heavy material.	Though it may not be as comprehensive as some would like, Francis Ford Coppola's cheerful biopic of the failed automotive designer features sparkling direction and a strong central performance from Jeff Bridges.
Amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community, one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger, fatter heart than Barbershop.	The script really should have been given a trim, as it tries to cram in so many characters that few are given the time and space to develop.	A great opportunity for various people to display their comic talents, especially Cedric the Entertainer in a great role of barbershop's sage...	Strongest when just letting us watch the people, this movie showcases the barbershop as a kind of roundtable of ideas being exchanged among social classes and generations.	This Barbershop may not provide you a soapbox or a good fade, but it'll definitely leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling.	Besides bringing on the laughs, Barbershop displays a big heart and demonstrates the value of community.
Forster's symbolism goes from clever to exasperating to, finally, sort of klutzily endearing - the work of a gifted art student who can't resist piling on the glitter.	The movie is so carefully made and well-acted, it's never really unwatchable and Gosling has been playing pallid, tremulous special-case guys so long he could do it napping.	A great big blurry mess.	...fussily enigmatic.	Pretentious claptrap.	A muddled brain-teaser, Stay has a solid cast and innovative visuals but little beneath the surface.
Zhang successfully subverts the adrenaline charge of combat to the thematic explorations of art, human emotions and history.	A ravishing, seductively alien fantasy.	Gorgeous martial arts movie for older kids.	Bursting with luscious color and stunning visual effects.	The movie is a marvel of coordinated special effects, martial artistry, costume design and set design.	With death-defying action sequences and epic historic sweep, Hero offers everything a martial arts fan could ask for.
For those who know nothing of this bitter conflict, the movie is a good start.	'71 brings a fresh perspective and a piercing urgency to a well-worn scenario.	The grainy, grimy, shadow-strewn look is right for this sort of military noir, and the women who haunt the edges of the conflict are splendid icons of both conscience and crushed humanity.	There is certainly enough about this young filmmaker to suggest a bright career beckons.	A big part of [Demange's] achievement resides in the casting of such a veteran crew of character actors in the first place, but credit is due for coaxing such subtle performances.	Powerfully directed and acted, '71 stays true to its fact-based origins while remaining as gripping as any solidly crafted action thriller.
After viewing the blistering thriller Changing Lanes, there's a whole new meaning to the phrase "driving each other crazy". Director Roger Michell pieces together a robust and energizing social drama	A slickly shot, intelligent thriller, it's buoyed up by an exceptional performance from Jackson, who brings crumpled dignity and pathos to his habitual loser.	Thanks to a tight screenplay by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin and the unflagging pace set by director Roger Michell, Changing Lanes doesn't feel overburdened by all its drama.	A surprisingly acid-tongued character study that has a good deal more on its mind than cheap thrills.	With a cast like this I expected much more - like to be entertained. I was hoping that they would just kill each other so I could get in my car and go home.	Though some may find its conclusion unsatisfying, Changing Lanes is a tense, well-crafted exploration of meaty ethical dilemmas.
Soderbergh, Tatum and McConaughey strip this world of glitter and body oils. They let us know that for all the supposed fringe benefits, these guys work hard for the money...	Shoulda been big fun, but a deadly combination of no script and a strange lack of sexiness renders this male-stripper tale an aimless, although very commercially calculated, bore.	As Mike, Tatum is a pillar of integrity, a hard-working stud with his eyes on the end game.	Soderbergh pulls out every trick in the book to make Magic mean something beyond its parade of shaved backs and tanned buttocks, but it's a lost cause, endeavoring to bring meaning to material best appreciated for its surface appeal.	I was gunning for Showgirls only as Show Boys. Instead director Steven Soderbergh did something normal and classy, which are two words I associate with his other films and did not want to describe this film.	Magic Mike's sensitive direction, smart screenplay, and strong performances allow audiences to have their beefcake and eat it too.
Jordan is the kind of director you follow out of trust, even when his movies aren't perfect.	Enchanting and hopeful.	an entertaining story of an eccentric young man	An ungodly mess of a picture which plays like a Frankenstein-ish cross between an Irish Forrest Gump and a less cohesive version of the already inaccessible Velvet Goldmine.	Breakfast on Pluto may seem a fairy tale at times (no pun intended), but this Kitten has claws.	Well-acted if monotonous drama about a transvestite prostitute in London during the 1970s.
The tediousness becomes a little too palpable and the film's first half is frankly dull, despite some fine acting from Depardieu and Balibar.	Amazing imagery of remarkable achievements and a chronicle of the sport but one that could have dug a little deeper into the psychology of the extreme skiers.	In the end, Steep plays like a TV infomercial -- and who wants to hand over $11 to watch one?	While it desperately wants to crossover to a mainstream audience, it is what it is: a movie for skiers.	Sometimes it takes escaping death to feel alive -- especially if we have survived a cancer scare, a road accident or some other potentially fatal encounter. But Steep is about those who actively seek that dance with danger.	Steep is a mixed bag of breathtaking mountain footage and yawn-inducing banter.
The surface, the film is stylish without losing its focus, and the gadgets, the settings and the characters all jump to life (as it were) in the cool domain of the extreme scenario.	[A] series that has yielded diminishing returns since Stephen Norrington's 1998 adaptation.	The movie is present, sexy and fun, but it's probably time to give this franchise - and Snipes' permanent scowl - a rest.	Well, Blade held up beautifully twice. But now the story is turning, well, bloodless.	One dull 'Blade'...even for a vampire series, this one is getting very long in the tooth.	Louder, campier, and more incoherent than its predecessors, Blade: Trinity seems content to emphasize style over substance and rehash familiar themes.
[A] little gem of a movie.	Thanks to a superb cast headed by the popular Brazilian actress Regina Casé, this unorthodox tale is ultimately believable.	A peculiar masculine fantasy.	The performances are charming and natural enough to draw you into this peculiar love quadrangle.	What's unusual is the almost achingly beautiful photography by Breno Silveira.	Me You Them tells a warmly comical and touching story, and features a charismatically earthy performance by Casж.
Billy Bob Thornton is just as mean as a gym coach as he is as Santa Claus.	Between Mr. Thornton's wry performance and Tami Reiker's nuanced wide-screen photography, you half-expect Woodcock to deliver more than formulaic laughs.	There's more genuine humor to be gleaned from saying 'Woodcock' over and over again than from watching Mr. Woodcock.	Mr Woodcock is never less than watchable, thanks to strong performances and some amusing dialogue, but it's badly let down by a disappointingly weak plot.	In spite of its piecemeal approach, "Mr. Woodcock" erupts with sidesplitting slapstick gags that more than compensate for subplots that never add up.	Underutilizing a talented cast, Mr. Woodcock lacks the comic energy and timing to make the most of its intriguing premise.
Masterfully manipulative and bloody scary.	There's no denying the eye for hypnotic imagery employed by writer-director Ji-woon Kim and cinematographer Mo-gae Lee.	Classic horror in the vein of Hitchcock, Argento and Miike...the scariest film in years!	The film succeeds again and again at pulling you to the edge of your seat and keeping you there.	How much you appreciate the film will largely depend on how effective you feel its big revelation is.	Restrained but disturbing, A Tale of Two Sisters is a creepily effective, if at times confusing, horror movie.
The best thing about Mr Popper's Penguins is that it makes no discernible sense.	Take just about any trope from a "kids and animals" flick, and you'll find it here, in its purest form, untainted with any creativity or charm.	Divorced or office-bound parents, beware: A kid who figures out the film's underlying message may just start asking for a puppy, or a pony.	A surprisingly touching, low-key ballad of middle-aged male regret disguised as a kiddie comedy replete with poop and fart jokes and soccer balls launched at Popper's crotch.	A particularly plain, patly penned picture preoccupied with penguin poop.	Blandly inoffensive and thoroughly predictable, Mr. Popper's Penguins could have been worse -- but it should have been better.
Mostly forgettable romantic comedy for teens and up.	Why Jennifer Garner was eager to play the lead in this film is anybody's guess.	[Garner] is moving up the likeability ladder to Sandra Bullock/Julia Roberts levels.	Take heart: you may feel that it takes forever, but the movie will eventually end.	This fish-themed romance flops wildly all over the place, from heavy poignant moments to slapsticky comedy, with a healthy dose of soapy melodrama in between.	A romantic dramedy with boring, stock characters and contrived situations.
A strong crime-thriller on par with some of the films from the Coen Brothers, one that keeps you captivated with every twist and development.	Finds the sweet spot in that realm of disturbing, unpredictable drama tinged with the blackest possible comedy...a deliciously dark and offbeat surprise.	Not terrible, not happy.	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	Terribly Happy, directed by Henrick Ruben Genz, is all moodiness, midnight black comedy and noir mystery.	Led by Henrik Ruben Ganz's assured direction, this knotty Danish noir thriller steers audiences into some nicely unexpected territory.
Forced to endure such casually offensive nonsense, the viewer ends up slumming it far more than the duff protagonists.	I liked it better with Brittany Murphy.	Along the way, self-discovery bangs 'em over the head.	The movie, which was not screened for critics, makes a joke of everyone who isn't wealthy, white and pencil thin.	Save your allowance, kids -- a mall trip would be way more fun than this ditzy Duff fluff.	Plagued by paper-thin characterizations and a hackneyed script, Material Girls fails to live up to even the minimum standards of its genre.
It's a resonant story about four boyhood friends, determination, sacrifice, overcoming obstacles and the mentor who guides them from rough beginnings to the national basketball championship. It's about victorious lives, not games.	It's always risky to mix sports metaphors, but it's hard to resist the notion that the basketball-themed More Than a Game is a knockout of a sports documentary.	While More Than a Game succeeds in depicting the friends' deep mutual affection, the edges of the LeBron James story are too often smoothed to a dull, inspirational point.	Like a gambler with an inside bet, you can know the final score, but still enjoy every second of the game.	evoted fans of the game, and especially of LeBron James, will love More Than a Game. The skeptical and the curious may find themselves wanting more.	Though the film may not delve as deep as some would prefer, More Than a Game is an inspiring documentary featuring likable youngsters, a positive message, and some exciting in-game footage.
La película está tan maravillosamente bien escrita y narrada, que al salir de la sala se respira un aire de esperanza...	The small scale of the film is challenging on a big screen; but the performances ... transcend that scope and make it a small story worth seeing.	The best domestic comedy-drama in ages, a genuine American beauty without all the flash of American Beauty.	One of the best American films of the year.	In this modest but brilliant little movie, we find ourselves immersed in life itself.	You Can Count On Me may look like it belongs on the small screen, but the movie surprises with its simple yet affecting story. Beautifully acted and crafted, the movie will simply draw you in.
The movie is clearly hagiographic, but this aspect and its general function as a martial arts movie are supported greatly by Yen.	A terrific true story, clearly elevated to mythical proportions, this film benefits hugely from the lucid fight direction by the master Sammo Hung, which gives the film a remarkable resonance.	First-rate martial-arts film about Bruce Lee's real-life teacher.	Yen's handful of duels do delight; it's everything surrounding them that feels tired and trite.	Ip Man is a highly competent, even slick biopic, but by reshaping its protagonist's life story towards cinematic convention, it ends up being just another martial arts movie.	At once beholden to the established conventions of the genre and delightfully subversive of them, Ip Man is one of the most exciting -- and refreshingly character-driven -- martial arts films in years.
Steadfastly avoids reducing the notions of perseverance and heroism to convenient catchphrases.	[Director Julian] Schnabel isn't going anywhere astounding in this film; it is, after all, about a man who can't move. But he is exploring the vast potential of both imagination and spirit.	Bauby, Harwood and Schnabel are probably the only people who'll be our guides on a journey like this, and better ones could not be found.	The Diving Bell and the Butterfly keeps opening up, its structure mimicking the awakening of its extraordinary protagonist's mind.	There is something cinematic about Bauby's situation. Like the moviegoer stuck in a seat in the dark, he can only observe the action in front of him. His comments are unheard by the people who move before his eyes and attempt to manipulate his emotions.	Breathtaking visuals and dynamic performances make The Diving Bell and the Butterfly a powerful biopic.
The material here may not be the freshest, but screenwriters Heather Hach and the redoubtable Leslie Dixon have buffed the dialogue until it sparkles like the finest cubic zirconium, and the cast is game from top to bottom.	[Freaky Friday] delivers scenes we can anticipate, but with more charm and wit than we expect.	A pleasant surprise.	For dumb movies about body-to-body switcheroos (a frighteningly well-represented comedy sub-genre) this Disney remake is pretty darn good.	Freaky Friday is a most pleasant summer surprise, a funny and sweet family comedy.	Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan charm in Mark Waters' nicely pitched -- and Disney's second -- remake of the 1976 hit.
You've probably seen toy commercials that present a more thoughtful dystopian future. And yet, in the moment, this film will make you want to do nothing except stuff your face with more.	The movie uses every trick it can to pull this off, which means using us. But to paraphrase Bill Withers, I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used, then keep on using me until you use me up.	Patently ludicrous but undeniably rousing.	This is a ridiculous movie. And yet, I enjoyed the hell out it. Not just because Hugh Jackman is in it. In IMAX. Though that doesn't hurt.	More successful as a rock 'em, sock 'em 'Rocky with Robots' vehicle than as a potent family drama, Real Steel is a scrappy but warm-hearted film which should nevertheless appeal to just about every boy under the age of 12.	Silly premise notwithstanding, this is a well-made Hollywood movie: Thrilling and exciting action with just enough characterization.
In truth, it doesn't quite work, but the dissonance between the content and Bujalski's approach is oddly compelling.	"Results" isn't always a successful film, but its philosophies about the myths of perfection as they apply to love are at least credible, funny and well observed.	Bujalski knows how to reveal the immaturities and hangups people hide behind money, ambition, and the pursuit of a better body.	Bujalski's wit remains devilishly dry, and his portrait of three very prickly souls who can monkey up almost any interaction is sly, lovingly structured yet still unswervingly funny.	Results doesn't really amount to much, but it's never less than engaging.	Results moves stubbornly at its own deliberate pace, but the well-chosen cast -- and writer-director Andrew Bujalski's insightful observations -- offer rich rewards for patient viewers.
An epic bio-pic has been turned into a Lifetime movie.	The events beg for Shakespearean gravity, but the only tragedy here is that so little could be made of so much.	A completely useless, over-enunciated film -- an instant antique.	okay, but more silver than gold this time out.	Menos interesante y mбs rutinaria que la primera Elizabeth (de 1998), esta segunda parte vale la pena mбs que nada por otra brillante composiciуn de Cate Blanchett.	This sequel is full of lavish costumes and elaborate sets, but lacks the heart and creativity of the original Elizabeth
Wait for the video.	Next Friday is an extremely funny movie, and this is coming from someone who barely cracked a smile during Friday, the first installment of this franchise.	A lifeless follow-up.	An altered state on the part of a viewer is about the only way for this film to be considered the laugh riot of the year.	Despite the absence of Chris Tucker, who launched his career in Friday, this sequel manages to be funny despite its unevenness.	Next Friday lacks the fun of the original Friday. The movie is messy and plotless and relies on unfunny vulgar gags.
A description of it would sound like a cliche from beginning to end. But Rocky isn't about a story, it's about a hero. And it's inhabited with supreme confidence by a star.	The memorable combination of the torturous gym workouts, the runs through the streets of Philadelphia and the carcass-beating in the abattoir all combine beautifully as Balboa trains 'to eat lightning and crap thunder'.	Sylvester Stallone [is] as likable as a basset hound.	Though far from a masterpiece, the first Rocky (1976) still feels fresh and miraculous, a true Cinderella story making Sylvester Stallone a worldwide star.	The story is achingly familiar, and though Stallone has a certain power, he is certainly not the subtlest actor to crawl out from under Marlon's overcoat.	This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints.
Talk all you want about technique: a good animated film depends on story and character, and it's those vital ingredients that make Mars Needs Moms so entertaining. It's also	The 'Polar Express'-style CG-meets-live-action visuals are creepy and flat, the characters are largely nonexistent and the story takes so many short cuts that it becomes meaningless...	An extraordinary achievement in character expressiveness and realistic movement limited by a storyline for a pre-middle school audience.	[VIDEO] Based on a children's book by cartoonist Berkeley Breathed (known for his "Bloom County" comic strip), "Mars Needs Moms" is a tone-deaf animated disaster.	None of it makes much sense, the characters are largely annoying and the underground Martian city is drab and uninviting.	The cast is solid and it's visually well-crafted, but Mars Needs Moms suffers from a lack of imagination and heart.
Short, but emotionally effective.	A unique documentary about the crisis confronting gay and lesbian Jews who wish to remain part of the Orthodox and Hasidic branches of Judaism.	... an emotional kaleidoscope, and a masterpiece.	The stories told ... are very compelling, interesting and often moving, but they do not and cannot explain the religious belief that those persecuted still want comfort from even as they challenge its dictums.	DuBowski's subject is so compelling that the film doesn't suffer from his traditional approach, which relies on to-the-camera interviews and verite footage of his subjects.	Trembling Before G-d looks at the effects of religious morality on believers whose sexuality falls outside the accepted norm with intelligence and compassion.
The film is very imaginative and you need to see it several times to appreciate the humor.	A computer-generated animated adventure featuring few product placements, which is quite a departure from the norm for such children's fare.	full review in Greek	This giddy exposition is polished in its nostalgic atmospheric look but has been assembled with the simplistic precision of piecing together a Tonka toy truck	Endearing "follow your dreams" story with plenty of laughs.	Robots delights on a visual level, but the story feels like it came off an assembly line.
I don't know whether this remake is faithful. Did the original include a scene in which the leading man puts on a bear costume in an effort to infiltrate cultists?	Unintentionally one of the funniest movies of the summer. Too bad it's supposed to be a thriller.	The original Wicker Man had its flaws, particularly in the lumpy pacing. LaBute's thoroughly inessential remake not only lovingly reproduces those flaws, it introduces a slew of new ones.	LaBute has replaced the seduction of the first film with a general sense of bewilderment and loss; it's good for building tension but doesn't fit with the payoff. The plot elements lead where they need to go well enough but don't mix particularly well.	It's never as scary or suspenseful as it aspires to be, but it might just be the greatest bad movie of the year, with its clunky writing resulting in some surprisingly entertaining kooky moments.	Puzzlingly misguided, Neil LaBute's update The Wicker Man struggles against unintentional comedy and fails.
The film treats this profoundly preposterous plot as if it were a serious idea.	Andrew Davis provides some memorable set-pieces in this impressive adaptation of the '60s TV series.;	A juggernaut of exaggeration, momentum and thrills.	I've already seen The Fugitive twice. I'll probably see it again.	One of the most exciting, intelligent, and all-around brilliant action films ever to hit the silver screen.	Exhilarating and intense, this high-impact chase thriller is a model of taut and efficient formula filmmaking, and it features Harrison Ford at his frantic best.
Stump is well-played by affable Robert Wuhl, who has the unenviable responsibility of representing the one sane man in Ty's crazy universe.	Of all the good and great movies that have slipped through the cracks in recent years, none has been treated as appallingly as Cobb.	Tommy Lee Jones gets mad respect for this.	Massively underrated.	Even allowing for the intentional excesses of such an episode, delicacy is a casualty here.	Tommy Lee Jones's searing performance helps to elevate Cobb above your typical sports biopic; he's so effective, in fact, that some may find the film unpleasant.
True, the story doesn't amount to much, but the plot tends to take a back seat when you've got a not-quite-50-foot version of Reese Witherspoon duking it out with a mighty alien robot alongside the Golden Gate Bridge.	Given that the film was sold as the biggest kind of spectacle, it's disappointing though not surprising that it's so barbarically typical.	The latest computer-animated production from DreamWorks is a perfectly acceptable family movie.	Pleasant but often pedestrian.	Kids will adore the flash 3D visuals, brilliant action sequences and ace sight gags. Mums, dads and others will relish the quickfire dialogue-some of the best we've heard for a while in any film-and the affectionate nods to sci-fi of times past.	Though it doesn't approach the depth of the best animated films, Monsters Vs. Aliens has enough humor and special effects to entertain moviegoers of all ages.
The movie is as bloodless as a cyborg, and it feels as if it has been assembled according to diagrams supplied by someone who studied every successful sci-fi action thriller and then multiplied the findings by 10.	Isn't a bad movie by any means; it's just a reasonably silly one that, in one form or the other, has been overdone to death.	Nothing but groans and yawns.	If you liked The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby , don't miss this one.	If you don't think about it too hard, it's kind of fun.	An overblown thriller with formulaic action scenes and poor acting.
The situations are forced; love blossoms way too easily; and the characters are downright daft.	Leaves you with the impression that it could go on and on, picking up loose threads and exploring stray implications. More remarkably, you find yourself wishing it would, because these absolutely ordinary people turn out to be infinitely interesting.	Mildly engaging melodrama that's more sharply written than directed.	It's dedicated to a fuller understanding of the human condition, a deeper appreciation of everything we take for granted in even the messiest melodramas.	As it stands, Tim's story rescues the movie, but barely.	Unconventional and refreshing, this strikingly un-Hollywood film takes a quiet and heartbreaking look at the warmth and inspiration of friendships lost.
The film is high on energy, color and camera movement and, as usual in Waters's world, everything is styled within an inch of its life, capturing all the fun and fever of the 1950s.	Waters is just as offbeat as any of his film characters- and he surrounds himself with creative people who wouldn't at all be out of place in a John Waters movie.	Basically the filmmaker reminds us of his affection for social misfits, but without much conviction. He's simply too hip to commit himself to his beliefs, and a relentless frivolity prevails.	Waters' hole card is Johnny Depp, the winsome tough from TV's 21 Jump Street, who radiates big- screen grace and swagger as Cry-Baby -- no easy trick, since he is guying his own image.	There are some funny moments, but this may be the first time the director's scabrous, anarchic wit seems vaguely depressed.	John Waters' musical ode to the teen rebel genre is infectious and gleefully camp, providing star Johnny Depp with the perfect vehicle in which to lampoon his pin-up image.
For old fans, there's much to recognize here - an almost Sirkian respect for melodrama, a natural empathy for women, a refusal to forget the past. Some new approaches, too ...	Intriguingly, the director has successfully woven a Kafkaesque metaphor into a classically Chinese melodrama.	A modern yet timeless tragedy that's desperate, sad and rich with devotion.	What this film may lack in terms of visual flamboyance, it more than makes up for in telling its simple and direct story with a raw, emotional power that doesn't need lavish spectacle in order to get its point across.	Saddest of all...given the film's promising start and world-class director/actor pairing, is the missed opportunity for something of greater depth.	The rare tearjerking melodrama with sociopolitical subtext, Coming Home plucks the heartstrings with thought-provoking power.
It's a kung fu action comedy played out to a Bollywood beat.	The movie's ostensible distinction is its coupling of Bollywood and kung fu, but it's really a self-realization course dressed up as kinetic comedy.	Spectacular stunts and special effects cannot save this fusion of Indian and Chinese culture from coming across as a movie with little originality or wit.	Chandni Chowk to China has something to offer every discerning film taste. And that's its major shortcoming.	Think of the title of this Bollywood/martial-arts mashup as a riff on North by Northwest. And like that preeminent American entertainment, CC2C is stylish, slick and full of fun.	A thin plot is disguised by high octane dancing and action in this Bollywood crossover comedy.
500 Days of Summer keeps its audience guessing, hoping, and perhaps most importantly feeling.	(500) Days of Summer knocks several romantic movie clichés on their ear, but never loses sight of heart or hope, and it never fails to make the ups and downs between Tom and Summer matter.	Smartly written and refreshingly affecting on its own terms. At the very least, it will make you smile.	A buoyant, whimsical charmer that glides by on wry laughs and movie-star magnetism.	(500) Days of Summer" is the first great cinematic romance of the Facebook generation.	A clever, offbeat romantic comedy, 500 Days of Summer is refreshingly honest and utterly charming.
Film of break-neck physical excitement and stunning visual attractions in which George Lazenby replaced Sean Connery as James Bond.	Rigg adds the class to feature that Connery usually did. When she's gone, the action scenes are as fine as any Bond's.	Besides not being a terribly good Bond entry, it's also a poorly made film.	Driven by a series of invigorating and breathtaking action sequences and anchored by a Bond of rare emotional depth.	007 in ski country -- and marriage territory?	George Lazenby's only appearance as 007 is a fine entry in the series, featuring one of the most intriguing Bond girls in Tracy di Vincenzo (Diana Rigg), breathtaking visuals, and some great ski chases.
Has no shortage of howlers and telegraphs its plot twists a mile away- but this ultra-glossy weepie turns out to be something of a guilty pleasure almost because of its extreme predictability.	A movie that teaches respect for "feelings" through a cocky middle-aged NYC restaurateur who learns he is capable of love in relationship with a vivacious young woman.	Just what it promises to be: a Love Story-style romance.	A banal and sappy romantic melodrama	The predictable screenplay overcomes the obvious age difference and eventually generates genuine emotion.	Although the film isn't as bad as feared (it wasn't pre-screened for reviews), it's not that good, either. Most noticable flaws are the sappy romantic cliches and lack of chemistry between Gere and Ryder.
Eat, Pray, Love was more like eat, pray for it to end, gag. Sample from its menu at your own risk.	Even if you buy Roberts as an introspective writer (I didn't), there's no real sense of an emotional journey here.	Most of its supposed observations sound more like touchy-feely mumbo-jumbo than honest, useful information and advice.	Julia Roberts boasts a charming presence and a lively mind but she deserves better than this superficial, glitzy and fluffy travelogue of self discovery, which has lots of food, some prayers but little love or sex.	It is a perfectly competently constructed movie, and an enjoyable one too.	The scenery is nice to look at, and Julia Roberts is as luminous as ever, but without the spiritual and emotional weight of the book that inspired it, Eat Pray Love is too shallow to resonate.
This rambling and episodic autobiographical saga of three friends coming of age in Inglewood, Calif. in the '80s is so determined to be likable that it forgets to be interesting.	By the film's final toast, one feels as if they are indeed part of The Wood.	A well-intentioned exercise in humanism... but as art or a successful narrative, the movie is ultimately empty.	A respectable debut.	It is unremarkable in every way, save one -- the cast is African-American.	A charming piece of work with believable characters.
This German rip-off of Herk Harvey's 1962 Carnival of Souls replaces the junky eeriness of the original with a disassociated pretentiousness that is more irritating than creepy.	Strikes a perfect balance between corporate intrigue and metaphysical mystery; his 2007 drama is filled with suspense but ends in delicious ambiguity.	Yella comes off as too intellectual an exercise to be thoughtful or serious entertainment.	Yella is a strange beast: a twisty, slightly surreal mystery wrapped around the tedious art of the business deal.	It's one of those films that keeps swirling in your brain once it's done -- thanks both to its somewhat unresolved ending and to the many subtle themes touched on throughout.	Chilly and haunting, Yella's atmosphere gets under the skin.
Uma admirável montanha-russa emocional.	Perhaps he might have been tougher but that might have rendered the film less digestible.	A sweet and masterful story of survival, transcendence, loyalty and friendship told with striking cinematography. A spiritual piece of work.	The Kite Runner doesn't just make us watch the battling kites in the skies over Kabul; it makes us truly see the people below, in many ways for the first time; that's the film's greatest achievement, and ultimately the best reason to see it.	The film feels totally convincing in all its technical aspects, including its use of Chinese locations to double for the story's Afghan setting.	Despite some fine performances, The Kite Runner is just shy of rendering the magic of the novel on to the big screen.
The kind of movie whose dialogue mostly hews to the rhythms of 'like, you know, whatever' but then occasionally throws in a word such as 'puissance.' And, like, it totally works.	Just because you shoot semi-improvised scenes in black-and-white doesn't mean you're the new Jim Jarmusch.	The dark side of a Waldorf education.	A modest step up from its assured predecessor in both content and form.	What Douglas Sirk did for big-budget Hollywood melodrama in films like Imitation of Life, Andrew Bujarski is doing for the low-budget indie.	Director Bujalski continues to give cinematic voice to awkward, literate twentysomethings with noteworthy smarts and tenderness.
The bad guy plot is dull and tiresome; the real charm of the film lies in its comedic elements and character relationships.	All icing, no cake.	Let me just say, Jet Li ROCKS in the kind of American debut Jackie Chan or Chow Yun-Fat would have killed for.	Crass, vulgar, childish, ultraviolent, profane, stupid and appealing to the lowest common denominator of movie audiences. And yet...	Not so much a continuation of the series as it is a present for the fans, just to keep them smiling and laughing along with the characters.	Jet Li's arrival breathes fresh life into a tired franchise formula -- but not enough to put Lethal Weapon 4 on equal footing with its predecessors.
The foreclosure of possibilities provided by the use of the long take assists in the indictment of chauvinism and patriarchal brutality that underpin, directly and indirectly, many moments in the film.	The centrifugal force is supplied by two stunning lead turns by Babluani and Bokeria.	Unpredictable, never forced, and forever compelling.	An absorbing, intelligently assembled coming-of-ager that revolves around two pubescent gal-pals growing up in 1992, just after independence was restored.	It's a universal story that is also, by virtue of its very particular time and place, a singular experience.	A coming-of-age drama entwined with a political statement, In Bloom underscores its well-worn themes with strong performances and palpable real-world tension.
Stunningly cinematic and audacious on every level.	Art and politics and ideals; mature.	When the final shot of a modern Disney-controlled Times Square bludgeons the point home one last time, you realize that the cradle rocked, fell and landed with a big, dumb thud.	The movie's radical stance is that artists should get to do their art without being destroyed by mean rich people, and aren't we just wonderful for agreeing with that?	Rock actually rocks out as one of the year's most purely entertaining movies.	Witty and provocative.
Notions of class, cultural, ideological and emotional violence - or perhaps a little of each - take on vastly difference meanings in this sensitively woven French Canadian journey through Algerian exile, student angst and outsider alienation	Fellag does for the film what his Lazhar does for the pupils: He's soothing and entrancingly enigmatic enough to keep us fixed to our seats.	Fellag, a comedian and himself an exile from Algeria, makes Lazhar both a sensitive and an amusing figure. And the kids are just terrific, especially Emilien Neron as a boy who carries the guilt of the whole school on his shoulders.	Fans of Nicolas Philibert's immaculate chronicle of the learning curve, Ętre et Avoir, are sure to appreciate the warm lessons of this award-winning Canadian film.	Phillipe Falardeau, who adapted the play into a screenplay, can't entirely paper over a few niggling loose ends, but overall this disturbing film is very effective indeed.	Monsieur Lahzar is a tender and thoughtful portrait of a man with hidden grief and also a compelling exploration of the teacher-student dynamic.
If you have not already seen Remember the Titans or Miracle or The Rookie or Hoosiers or Coach Carter or Rudy or The Bad News Bears or The Mighty Ducks then perhaps you will love Glory Road.	Until inspirational sports films stop making us feel good, expect several more. This is a fun ride that will make you smile.	OK, so you really don't need me to tell you about Glory Road if you've ever seen a sports movie before. Just get out your sports-movie-cliché checklist and a pencil.	A no frills, by the numbers, formula sports film that will entertain, educate, inspire. Credits include interviews w/ members of the original team, Haskins and Pat Riley.	... Deals with the issue of race about as realistically as can be expected from a Disney movie.	As formulaic as sports movies get, this underdog story still triumphs on the strength of its inspiring story.
More a concept than a movie, and the concept just isn't as clever as the filmmakers think.	White Goodman is one of Stiller's craziest creations, a hilariously dim-witted and mean-spirited jock that doesn't realize how pathetic he really is.	This is a spoof of sport movies with a misfit dodgeball team taking on the meanest team anywhere.	Can somebody please stop Ben Stiller?...The (movie's) one vicariously vengeful pleasure is seeing the actors repeatedly take real shots to the head from big red rubber balls.	Stiller gives one of his broadest and best performances to date, and the jokes ping around the screen as fast as the balls on the court.	Proudly profane and splendidly silly, Dodgeball is a worthy spiritual successor to the goofball comedies of the 1980s.
An overproduced summer bombast.	Absolutely everybody onscreen is having a ball.	The comedy is blissfully perfect!	Impeccable casting!	An instant cult comedy that doesn't walk or talk like anything else out there.	Absurd characters and quirky gags are brought to life by a talented cast, providing this superhero spoof with lots of laughs.
Mr. Brooks is one deliriously ridiculous movie, and a bona fide contender for status as a camp classic.	Evans delivers mood, tone and acting in this seductively quiet and unhysterical film, but so overstuffs his screenplay with plot he very nearly upends his own project.	What compels isn't the overwrought plot, but the simpler things, the dynamics between the actors, the avuncularity between old pros Costner and Hurt and the class condescension between Costner and Cook. It has a fascinatin' rhythm.	...cops a little of the cheerfully sanguine attitude of the Showtime series Dexter , although there's no effort to rehabilitate Brooks by half measures at work here.	There's so much unexamined rage in Mr. Brooks that the movie plays like a training video for psychotherapists.	The setup is intriguing, but Mr. Brooks overstuffs itself with twists and subplots, becoming more preposterous as it goes along.
Anime has never been my cup of oolong. Or it wasn't until Satoshi Kon's bold, time-traveling sophomore feature, Millennium Actress.	It's hard to imagine anyone who appreciates animation as an art form not enjoying this film.	Delightfully warm and unexpectedly, deeply humanistic...	A stylish if somewhat disjointed film.	As a piece of visual legerdemain as well as a rumination on the place movies have in our personal and collective subconscious, Millennium Actress fascinatingly goes where films have not often gone before.	The story of an aging movie actress' complicated personal saga unfolds in this sophisticated anime film that deftly blurs memory and make-believe into a meditation on the nature of cinema itself.
A wickedly funny movie.	Nervy and sensitive, it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement, and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives Hollywood.	With Adaptation, Kaufman has found an entirely new way of telling a story, belying the old credo that there's nothing left that's new for the movies to show us.	This loopy comedy certainly scores points for originality -- or at least until it writes itself into a corner during the final half-hour.	If you loved "Being John Malkovich," you're going to love "Adaptation."	Dizzyingly original, the loopy, multi-layered Adaptation is both funny and thought-provoking.
An exemplary examination of coping that expands to entail questions of morality, absolution and faith.	Lee has a rare gift for depicting how the minor dissonance of everyday interactions eventually explodes into public displays of rage and despair.	Profoundly moving, intelligent and unflinching. It boasts a brave, emotionally devastating performance by Jeon Do-yeon.	The amount of tragedy delivered by this story would feel abusive if a lesser talent was at its center.	An uncompromising experiment in how much suffering a soul can take, both on screen and in one's cinema seat.	Plumbing the depths of tragedy without succuming to melodrama, Chang-dong Lee's Secret Sunshine is a grueling, albeit moving, piece of beautifully acted cinema.
The General isn't likely to be the favorite opus of the star's purist fans, but it's the one with the trappings of ambition and historical poesy	Silent classic is one of Keaton's best	The film boasts the most sustained passages of virtuoso slapstick genius Keaton ever shot, and an unflagging momentum that lets it get away with being a reel longer than most of his best-known pictures.	Among the finest comedies of all time, it wears its greatness lightly.	A hilarious comedy and a thrilling action film. The General has it all.	Brilliantly filmed and fueled with classic physical comedy, The General captures Buster Keaton at his timeless best.
"Klaatu Barada Nikto" are the words that launched a thousand spaceships in this early sci-fi standard.	Like most of Robert Wise's work, this slickly constructed 1951 science fiction film settles squarely in the middle of its genre, better than some and worse than others.	The most amazing thing about this excellent film is how well it has held up and how its message is just as true today as it was in the immediate post-Second World War years.	Next time your parents tell you that they don't make them like they used to, believe them.	I always have to change the channel when this is on for some reason	Socially minded yet entertaining, The Day the Earth Stood Still imparts its moral of peace and understanding without didacticism.
As deadly to brain cells as huffing paint thinner, but more delightful!	A bad idea poorly executed.	Oedekerk mugs mercilessly, and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between.	Totalement con et absurde, mais aussi totalement hilarant.	An incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic.	A short sketch's worth of jokes stretched into a full-length feature.
A brutally honest, at times embarrassingly raw, attempt to capture a modern day, urban relationship...bittersweet and filled with memorable details, a huge leap forward for [director] Sachs.	The cast, uniformly excellent, draws us into a vibrant, energetic Manhattan where commitments are forged and broken through sheer chance and those seeking permanence must continually resist temptation and ennui.	A nuanced portrait of emotional turmoil, persuasively acted, richly sensual one moment, wrenching the next ...	Unerring acting keeps this film honest, so that, while not tragedy, it is true and far from the gay fluff or doom often offered up.	[A] haunting, melancholy relationship drama.	Keep the Lights On is a mysterious, sexy journey deep into the love affair of two men that always manages to stay true to life.
Starting Out in the Evening is a gentle collection of scenes that work and scenes that don't.	Unusual and absolutely riveting.	It's an intimate drama -- a chamber piece, really -- that deals intelligently with intriguing themes and provocative ideas regarding the ambiguous motives and borrowed-from-life material that fuel the creative process.	Frank Langella and Lili Taylor give great performances in what is essentially another painfully slow and bland digitally-shot indie drama.	Shrewder than it initially lets on, primarily because it refuses to schematically pigeonhole its characters.	Starting Out in the Evening features sharp dialogue and moving performances from the talented Frank Langella and Lili Taylor.
The two-hour-plus running time is quite an endeavor, and Björk ... rises to the occasion, showcasing captivating ability that'll make you forget this is a musical and just see the quality filmmaking.	Björk is magic in the lead role. It is no wonder she won the best actress award at Cannes because of power and subtlety of her performance.	Has moments of unbelievable power and horror ... and these moments make the rest worthwhile.	"Dancer in the Dark" is an exciting and daring experiment in musical filmmaking.	I got very little out of this particular freak show.	Dancer in Dark can be grim, dull, and difficult to watch, but even so, it has a powerful and moving performance from Bjork and is something quite new and visionary.
Greenberg is a perceptive look at coming to terms with, if not entirely embracing, the life you weren't expecting and by no means wanted.	Through the casual pacing of the script and Harris Savides' gloriously brumous cinematography, Greenberg becomes more about other people's interpretations of Roger than the man himself.	As played by Ben Stiller, the character of Greenberg fails to transcend his abhorrent exterior.	In many ways this is Baumbach's best film, filled with his bitter but often funny misanthropic perspective, but buoyed by the undeniable likability of Stiller and Gerwig.	His sharpest observations are reserved for preternaturally intelligent, hyper-self-conscious outsiders whose existential crises are the failure of the world-and, to some extent, themselves-to live up to their own high expectations.	Greenberg's title character is harder to like than most, but Ben Stiller's nuanced performance and a darkly funny script help take the misanthropic edge off.
A gloriously heartfelt story about identity, love and cultural divides.	It's exactly the sort of import you'd expect to walk off with an Academy Award.	Stealing scene after scene is the daughter (played by both Lea Kurka and Karoline Eckertz), who adds charm to this top-notch effort.	Merely watchable.	This is an intelligent epic told without special pleading, a film able to cut deep enough to reveal a keen specificity of experience.	A visually lovely epic with compelling, three-dimensional characters.
The film is rescued by a strong third act, but getting there is torture.	God forbid Arnold should have to shell out for one of those Spanish-speaking turbomen being hocked in the bad part of town.	Home Alone, this is not, but for a family Christmas movie, it's surprisingly fun.	The practice of buying indulgences didn't die with the Middle Ages, it just sort of metastasized into something black and malignant at the heart of our society.	Jingle All the Way won't become a holiday chestnut, but it does deserve to be roasted.	Arnold Schwarzenegger tries his best, but Jingle All the Way suffers from an uneven tone, shifting wildly from a would-be satire on materialism to an antic, slapstick yuk-fest.
Cute if predictable.	One of the most uplifting and inspirational movies of the year.	Director Sacha Gervasi finds a funky charm in this pair.	Anvil! is a stupendous document of perseverance and crushing musical industry realities, brought to life by the two men who somehow managed to keep the devil horns raised for over 30 years of disappointment.	Anvil! The Story of Anvil can't help but evoke This Is Spinal Tap, the classic 1984 mockumentary directed by the other Rob Reiner, in terms of both sheer hair-metal ludicrousness and indignities suffered by a not-so-successful rock band on the road.	A touching, uplifting and inspirational rockumentary about an aging metal band, both hilarious and heart-warming in equal measure.
Its worst offense is assuming the audience is so dumb that it'll be shocked by one of the most telegraphed endings in movie history. On second thought, maybe the filmmakers got their wish: Whiteout is shocking, shockingly bad.	An uninspired thriller.	Whiteout conditions don't translate well to the action genre, either. Unless you don't mind watching unidentifiable snow-suited folks grapple in -50C conditions with an also-unidentifiable icepick-wielding murderer as CG ice violently pelts down on them.	...the whole cast delivers numb, almost affect-less performances; the cold must have got to them.	Ice-schlocky - an idiotic wipeout.	Kate Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold.
Edgar Wright Experiments with Video Game as Artistic Flourish and Succeeds Despite the Weakness in Structure and Cast.	If only it was based on an actual video game. Then we could finally have 'the best movie based on a video game.'	An interesting statement on modern youths detachment from actual human emotions through the advent of technology...	Feels like the first movie aimed squarely at the gamer generation: those who have grown up with videogames as a fact of life and, in some cases, a reason for living.	Scott Pilgrim tries so hard to be loved that it ends up very trying indeed.	Its script may not be as dazzling as its eye-popping visuals, but Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is fast, funny, and inventive.
Recycles every cliché of the genre to sleep-inducing effect.	Stiles and Thomas are good together, in a warm and fuzzy, as opposed to hot and heavy, sort of way.	More interesting as a barometer of suburban girls' fantasies than it is as a movie.	Gives off enough energy and light that the audience wants to believe in it even if society's impacted prejudices continue to say otherwise.	If "Dance" stumbles into a few too many subplots and a couple of cliched characters along the way, it also makes some strong points about contemporary attitudes toward the idea of interracial romances.	This teen romance flick feels like a predictable rehashing of other movies.
The script has its moments but it lacks the unadulterated sense of fun that was so integral to many of the earlier Marvel movies.	Good versus evil's romp through space reeks of Star Wars and Star Trek, with a worse plot and better effects.	Sci-fi hasn't been this fun since Star Wars and it hasn't been this funny since Galaxy Quest.	Gunn has done a marvelous job of character development with a large cast of unknown comic-book roles.	Where other comic-book fare has felt like action blockbusters with sprinkles of comic relief, Gunn has been allowed to make a comedy that happens to feature comic-book characters.	Guardians of the Galaxy is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect -- as well as funny, thrilling, full of heart, and packed with visual splendor.
Die-hard Bard students may quibble, but this gargantuan and glorious Hamlet is a movie-lover's paradise.	Shakespeare's great tragedy -- all of it.	Fine version of one of The Bard's best plays.	Not many filmmakers would dare to film and then market a four-hour film like this, but Branagh pulls it off marvelously.	Glorious as it is, this unexpurgated workout is ultimately a movie of moments.	Kenneth Branagh's sprawling, finely textured adaptation of Shakespeare's masterpiece lives up to its source material, using strong performances and a sharp cinematic focus to create a powerfully resonant film that wastes none of its 246 minutes.
The movie really belongs to Hackman's Royal, playing the role of miscreant to the hilt.	Wilson and Anderson have served up a plate of hilariously imperfect characters to populate the world of the Tenenbaum family.	the film's most incredible achievement is that it leaves you not only smiling, but with a sense of hope for this screwed-up clan	Wes Anderson's follow-up to Rushmore is a stylish but moribund exercise that chokes on the tongue lodged in its cheek.	Dysfunctional-family movies have been done to death but Anderson paints these characters with meticulous originality.	The Royal Tenenbaums is a delightful adult comedy with many quirks and a sense of poignancy. Many critics especially praised Hackman's performance.
The film is shoddy and amateurish; the blood in the gunfight scenes even looks like ketchup.	A yawningly familiar melodrama about an enterprising hustler who's undone by his own ambitions.	Just a piece of flashy trash, disheartening in terms of both its empty cinematic pizzazz and its calculated amorality.	Not atrocious, but certainly far from being as good as it might have been.	This is the most predictable plot twist since The Greatest Story Ever Told. You really know this one is coming and it just ruins the whole movie.	In terms of the gangster genre, Empire's story is yet another tired retread.
Almost as sharp as the first film and only suffering slightly from the inevitable repetitions.	Effectively slimed everyone's fond memories of the original.	Feels like a blueprint concocted by the bean-counters at Columbia Pictures.	The sequel is, on the whole, a fairly mechanical spook show, filled with grinning ghosts that are definitely ghoulish but hardly menacing.	The film is largely an excuse for a cast get-together, with the Ghostbusters, under judicial restraining order after the havoc wreaked in part one, suffering lives of semi-obscurity.	Thanks to the cast, Ghostbusters 2 is reasonably amusing, but it lacks the charm, wit, and energy of its predecessor.
Accomplishes beautifully what it sets out to do, which is to reveal the man behind the crusty, hard-drinking, tough-talking persona Charles Bukowski so artfully crafted.	It's to first-time filmmaker John Dullaghan's credit that he offers a portrait of the Southern California poet and novelist that digs beyond Bukowski's hard-drinking, hard-loving persona.	A rare unfolding of the man behind the image.	While his friends and fans provide the factual information about Buk's life, it's the interview with the man himself, and footage from his infamous public readings, that really put the whole picture together.	Over a period of seven years, Dullaghan interviewed hundreds of people who knew or were affected by Bukowski. The result is both wide-ranging and intimate.	A thoroughly engrossing documentary examining the life of talented but troubled writer Charles Bukowski.
...it ultimately does go without saying that Polanski's fans will find more to embrace here than his detractors.	On a scene-by-scene basis, it sometimes entertains, but never amounts to anything.	Sorely underrated...wisely counter-cultural to Hollywood's idea of what a supernatural thriller should be. [Blu-ray]	Unwilling to settle on one climax to his lumbering narrative, Polanski seems to have included them all.	Early on I thought I could almost smell the sharp must of the leather bindings ... but that scent was just the aroma of middle-brow, art-house Euro-rot, a whiff of decay and hauteur.	Even though the film is stylish and atmospheric, critics say The Ninth Gate meanders aimlessly and is often ludicrous. And despite the advertising, there's hardly any chills.
It's opaque where it should be clear (motivations; fight scenes). It's clear where it should be opaque (what happens next).	Elektra does have some action in it, which is especially awesome if you're into bed sheets flying around.	While Elektra is better than Daredevil and Catwoman, it doesn't hold a candle to really good superhero movies like X-Men and Spider-Man.	Substituting titillating triumph for tragedy, this adaptation of Marvel Comics' knife-wielding knockout comes across as hopelessly blunted.	The constant talk and tease of Elektra is sure to cause even more male frustration than Catwoman and Tomb Raider, where the femmes were similarly dolled up and then sexed down to appease the nanny censors.	Jennifer Garner inhabits her role with earnest gusto, but Elektra's tone deaf script is too self-serious and bereft of intelligent dialogue to provide engaging thrills.
Ms. Coppola is well on her way to becoming a talent in her own right, and Lost in Translation is a great next step in that journey.	This is another step in Mr. Murray's career and one that hopefully gets him the recognition he deserves.	Though the year is 2003 and the world is, in so many ways, at its smallest ... we are, this extraordinary new movie reminds us, ever more diffused, ever less able to make meaningful connections.	it's as if someone in Blade Runner decided to take a left turn away from the part of town where all those robots are killing people, and took time out to be alone	With this film it becomes clear that Sofia Coppola is a filmmaker with eyes all her own.	Effectively balancing humor and subtle pathos, Sofia Coppola crafts a moving, melancholy story that serves as a showcase for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.
Trust me, you've gotta check this thing out at least once, especially if you like football.	A movie so bad, so inept, so unbelievably painful, it's almost impossible to comprehend anyone thought it would be great on-screen...	Cult-phenom amateur melodrama best left to adults.	It is a prime example of enthusiasm outrunning talent.	PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE gave me nowhere near as many belly laughs. Tommy Wiseau is a bit like Shatner or Schwarzenegger before they became self-aware.	A bona fide classic of midnight cinema, Tommy Wiseau's misguided masterpiece subverts the rules of filmmaking with a boundless enthusiasm that renders such mundanities as acting, screenwriting, and cinematography utterly irrelevant. You will never see a football the same way again.
As intriguing as it is downright eerie.	Films like The Blair Witch Project use a fake documentary format to try and create a horror film about an urban myth that turns out to be real. Cropsey, though, is the real deal.	The portentous narration and manipulative horror-film aesthetics turn what might have been a portrait of a boogeyman myth's lingering societal role into merely a crude episode of 48 Hours.	This disturbing true-crime documentary takes its name from a local bogeyman that video makers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio were warned about when they were growing up on Staten Island.	This horrifying documentary stirs up, if not confirms, your worst fears.	Riveting and bone-chillingly creepy, Cropsey manages to be one of the best documentaries and one of the best horror movies of the year.
"Jiro Dreams of Sushi"is as elegant and tasty as the splendid sushi prepared by the man in the title, and that is saying a lot	Overall, this is a pleasant and often enlightening journey.	The centerpiece is a gorgeously photographed sequence showing a dinner at Jiro's restaurant, a "concerto" of the many courses (all sushi, no appetizers) that will make any foodie's mouth water.	The real star of the movie is the delectable sushi itself.	The movie functions well as high-end food porn, but it's also an insightful character study of the single-minded Jiro.	Beautiful, thoughtful, and engrossing, Jiro Dreams of Sushi should prove satisfying even for filmgoers who don't care for the cuisine.
This is simply exploitation on a very juvenile level.	Wild animation, tons of blaring rock music, and fanboy wish fulfillment fantasies of the freakiest order. Good campy fun.	Heavy Metal despite all of its flaws and anacrhonisms, nevertheless represents something of a refreshment in today's sterile climate.	You have to conclude that its makers should have got out more.	Some of the animation is first-rate, particularly in the more modest comedy segments, and even the heavy set pieces have greater flash and dazzle than anything Ralph Bakshi mustered around the same period.	It's sexist, juvenile, and dated, but Heavy Metal makes up for its flaws with eye-popping animation and a classic, smartly used soundtrack.
Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise.	The Cold Turkey would've been a far better title.	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl.	Half of the humor goes into the "how could they possibly have thought that was funny?" file.	A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss.	The Hot Chick's one-note concept gets stretched thin, and a lot of the jokes fall flat.
For all the bucolic beauty and ravishing romance, we're reminded that violence is never far from the surface - and Vinterberg captures the brewing tragedy magnificently.	David Nicholls deserves huge credit for condensing Hardy's sprawling melodrama into a rollicking screenplay that comes in at under two hours and still hits all the major plot points.	It's a classy and seductive example of the art of the intimate epic.	Ultimately, this is a romance, so our heroine never strays too far from the appointed path - and its swoony end - but the director also gives her space to explore what it might be like to, well, just have your own piano.	A painterly movie with stunning cinematography, 'Far From the Madding Crowd' stays faithful to the classic novel by Thomas Hardy. The story of manners and class distinctions is told with director Thomas Vinterberg's focus on environments and costumes.	Far from the Madding Crowd invites tough comparisons to Thomas Hardy's classic novel -- and its previous adaptation -- but stands on its own thanks to strong direction and a talented cast.
Even though it has an uneven narrative, it's worth watching. [full review in Spanish]	Heineman and his crew gain a terrifying level of access, giving us front-row seats to the drug war.	A movie that seeks action over analysis and could draw in the type of audience that does not regularly attend documentaries.	Heineman goes through the gates of Hell and comes back empty-handed.	Cartel Land [is a] spellbinding, verite documentary -- a frontline look at the murderous Mexican drug cartels.	Raw, brutal, and bitter, Cartel Land offers a ground-level look at vigilante efforts to thwart organized crime at the Mexican-American border.
The baby-voiced costar of Chasing Amy proves an effortless filmmaker, turning Lucy's journey into the awakening of a soul.	This is a quietly powerful film about small-town Southern living that avoids all the usual clichés and makes us feel as if we're dropping in on real lives in mid-stream.	...nothing less than a minor key wonder of a film, a character study of novelistic complexity with a sure sense of place and purpose that seems akin to movies made before Hollywood discovered its corporate destiny.	The script is somewhat predictable and the pace is leisurely, but Ms. Judd makes Lucy's choices seem momentous, and Ms. Adams gives us several beautiful scenes.	What Come Early Morning does is create an utterly convincing central character, and surround her with a milieu and backstory that is sincere and convincing.	A quiet but moving film anchored by the unexpected depth of Ashley Judd's performance.
A film approximately 48 times worse than the original.	Miller has gone bigger and better on everything - the stakes are raised, the risk is greater, the fears are bigger, and, as a result, the pay-offs are better and the highs higher.	It's not very good as a film, but there's no denying its stunning animation, particularly in the service of its two daffiest new characters Will (voice of Brad Pitt) and Bill the Krill (voice of Matt Damon), and its sheer lunacy can be invigorating.	Mumble is grown up. He has a son Eric. The boy is convinced he can fly. If only his movie could fly.	If the original, Academy-Award-winning "Happy Feet" left you with your toes tapping, then you'll leave this one with happy feet, too.	The animation is as eye-popping as ever, but Happy Feet Two's narrative is too noisily incoherent to recapture the Oscar-winning charm of its predecessor.
When the psychology is incomprehensibly vague, and the thrills nowhere in sight, I'd say the mess is complete.	Lo que mantiene el interйs es el cada vez mбs impredecible comportamiento de la esposa, animada ademбs por una estupenda Helen Mirren (la mejor intйrprete de la pelнcula).	Mr. Brugge has perhaps succeeded in avoiding vulgar melodrama, but he has hit on something far worse -- a bloodless melodrama, with bottled water running in its veins.	It all adds up to an acute character study -- but as a thriller, it's too cerebral to quicken the pulse.	It's one of those movies that seems to have started out as one thing and ended up as quite another.	Though it has an excellent cast, this emotionally detached movie is the kind that one admires more than enjoys.
A curiously languid affair, rather than the breathless Costa-Gavras-style thriller which was the least one might have expected from this kind of material.	Weir's movies are open-ended, stylish dramas that engage our senses, psyche, and wonder.	A good, romantic melodrama that suffers more than most good, romantic melodramas in not being much better than it is.	Combining political intrigue, steamy romance, and engaging characters, Peter Weir's well-crafted, highly enjoyable adventure is one of the few successful efforts to make a Casablanca-like movie for modern audiences.	Biting, tense Weir film--factually based	Both a smart, suspenseful tale of intrigue and a sweeping romance, The Year of Living Dangerously features excellent performances from Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver as a pair of journalists covering political unrest in Indonesia.
This is eye candy with a hollow centre.	The pacing of this 3-D animation film is uneven, from slow and sad to madcap, but eventually all is explained and it turns out to be a decent time travel story.	entertaining without getting too scary for kids, too dumb for parents or too outlandish for movie lovers.	Whether you see this loony, feel-good comedy in 3-D or in regular vision, it's a lot of fun.	The animation strives for 1950s sci-fi retro, but the result is that everyone looks like a plastic animé doll.	Meet the Robinsons is a visually impressive children's animated film marked by a story of considerable depth.
The beautifully acted ensemble film The Witnesses sidesteps most of its opportunities for high drama, political sermonizing and the jerking of tears.	The Witnesses has an emotional maturity that adds richness to its social observation.	Some may think the metaphoric possibilities of an incurable illness that can be transmitted through sexual contact have been all but exhausted. Director André Téchiné almost proves otherwise in The Witnesses, a kind of film opera without music.	As in real life, often the main crisis morphs into a continuance that has no slam-bang conclusion. Rather, we just see a small hope that awakes to experience another sunrise.	A moral tale that isn't saddled with moralism, The Witnesses is a novelistic film in the best sense.	French director André Téchiné successfully weaves five gripping stories in an engaging and realistic film about the early days of the AIDS epidemic.
Not the best of the three but Robert Downey, Jr. is better than ever.	That is why Iron Man 3 does a very smart thing, something comic fans have always known is what makes comics great: it takes a superhero and focuses on the man.	Iron Man 3 is neither turgid nor zippy. It soars at times, and dawdles in places.	Iron Man 3 provides loads of high-flying fun thanks to the immense charisma of the quick-quipping Robert Downey Jr.	With superhero movies, over time the mythology gets junked up with tertiary characters and leftover storylines. Tony Stark & Co. have taken the Iron Man franchise as far as it can go.	With the help of its charismatic lead, some impressive action sequences, and even a few surprises, Iron Man 3 is a witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon.
If you liked "Dogville," you won't want to miss this Danish Cake of minimalism.	American filmmakers, novelists and artists of all stripes have dealt the perplexing issue of race relations for decades, even centuries. Nothing von Trier presents here, whether real or imagined, is fresh or new.	Von Trier may not be completely right, but he certainly isn't all wrong.	I am glad that [Von Trier] exists, to decry our sins, but, with another sequel to come (Manderlay is the centerpiece of a trilogy), I am even gladder that he is one of a kind.	Manderlay isn't as powerful or as intense as Dogville, but it is still an intriguing and entertaining film, thanks to Bryce Dallas Howard's performance and John Hurt's hugely enjoyable narration.	Manderlay may work better as a political statement than as a film, making its points at the expense of telling a compelling story.
Pic is particularly well-crafted, managing to avoid the ambulance-chasing tenor that might easily have turned this into a voyeuristic freakshow.	Returns repeatedly to the tangled relationship between hipsters and the out-of-control oddballs they enable.	Occasionally slides into a breathless fan tribute, but nonetheless an affectionate and candid portrait of a troubled artist.	"I think he was having fun teasing me. What do you think?" Daniel Johnston's mother and father are still trying to figure out their perplexing child, even now, when he's 44 years old.	Like Capturing the Friedmans, Devil is loaded with revealing footage, rife with psychodrama, including a creepy home movie in which the teenage Johnston plays himself and his overbearing mother.	Whether you think this mentally ill cult musician is worthy of being called a "genius," this document of his life is crafted with sincere respect and is fascinating to watch.
While Farhadi's eye for detail is as unsparing as ever, his style this time around has begun to look formulaic.	A thickly knotted and compelling tale, set in an unglamorous, working-class Paris, it churns with complex emotions, suspense, guilt, and regret.	'The Past' opens at a Paris airport, where Marie and the newly arrived Ahmad greet each other through a pane of glass. Their lips move, but they don't actually hear one another. This is a state that will be maintained more or less throughout the film.	The narrative complications can be distracting, at times exasperating, but they're finally irrelevant because Mr. Farhadi's filmmaking is so fluid, and the performers, Ms. Bejo, in particular, are so attractive.	One of the best films of the season, with remarkable dramatic performances.	Beautifully written, sensitively directed, and powerfully acted, The Past serves as another compelling testament to Asghar Farhadi's gift for finely layered drama.
About halfway through writing a review of Shutter Island, I was caught by an undertow. I originally thought that the movie was stylistic nonsense. But then I realized that beneath the nonsense were intriguing swirls and tides.	Shutter Island is a hypnotic and disturbing thriller. A near-masterpiece.	Scorsese feverishly works over the script with his typical widescreen gusto, only to end up with a flaccid central mystery barely worth the exertion.	Shutter Island feels disappointingly like a minor work. But hey, who says every film has to be a masterpiece?	Despite its pacing problems and 'I see dead people' denouement, Scorsese's latest is a brain-scrambling good time	It may not rank with Scorsese's best work, but Shutter Island's gleefully unapologetic genre thrills represent the director at his most unrestrained.
Connery, Baldwin, a Tom Clancy novel; great fun.	The first Jack Ryan thriller adventure is a supremely mounted film, well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery, and vastly enjoyable.	Clancy is known for writing difficult books, but the movie makes plausible a preposterous situation because of Baldwin's convincing, low-key approach to being a film hero.	It is Sean Connery who really makes this movie work for me.	Regressive old-fashioned thriller of a sort that mostly died out 20 years earlier.	Perfectly cast and packed with suspense, The Hunt for Red October is an old-fashioned submarine thriller with plenty of firepower to spare.
The film itself seems lost in a time warp -- even its attitude toward the '80s is out of date considering the ongoing revival in music and fashion from that era.	Kickin' It Old Skool equates making incalculable 80s pop culture references with joke telling.	The funniest thing about Kickin' It Old Skool, yet another in a long line of not particularly funny Kennedy movies, is how little we actually have advanced since the '80s.	Were the filmmakers really so wedded to every scene they couldn't find 15 minutes to cut? Besides, shouldn't we as a culture being moving on to depleting the comic potential of '90s nostalgia by now?	Adults old enough to appreciate the choice electro-boogaloo soundtrack and get the 'Mr. Roboto' jokes will doubtless find the rest of it painfully dumb.	Kickin' It Old Skool is one big unfunny pop culture reference that doesn't feature many laughs.
Blue Streak is a decent action flick packed with laughs.	A lifeless farce!	Lawrence has become involved in a film that makes us acutely embarrassed for him.	Blue Streak suffers from an identity crisis.	Succeeds as an undemanding, fast-paced comedy.	Martin Lawrence lends his comedic touch, but the movie isn't much more than standard action-comedy fare.
An old-fashioned and occasionally schmaltzy movie that delivers an emotional wallop sure to elicit tears from all but those with truly intractable hearts.	"The Notebook" is a story for those who believe that love is the most powerful force in the universe... or for those who merely want to.	Men hardly need to be warned that this is basically just Titanic without anything cool like a ship sinking or Kate Winslet posing for art.	Manages to touch a chord, even if it's a minor one.	A sweetly sappy, sentimental story exploring haunting, enduring memories of a summer romance that lasts a lifetime.	It's hard not to admire its unabashed sentimentality, but The Notebook is too clumsily manipulative to rise above its melodramatic clichés.
It's willfully out of date, like an aging hair band that can't pack away the spandex.	The impressive-sounding cast only temporarily distracts from a plot riddled with holes, clichéd dialogue and fight sequences too reliant on quick edits.	The Expendables is third-rate.	Occasionally fun in its over-the-top mindlessness; the fun just never lasts more than a couple minutes at a time.	With only a couple of artistic virtues and even fewer moral attributes to its credit..."The Expendables" is wretched.	It makes good on the old-school action it promises, but given all the talent on display, The Expendables should hit harder.
It's a powerful and thought-provoking movie.	Vinterberg's acidic, important and brilliantly infuriating thriller reaches the heights of his best work, cannily examining the psychology of mob mentality, and bound to leave viewers in a state of high anxiety.	Vinterberg's best filmmaking since his Dogme '95 entry "The Celebration."	Mikkelsen, an actor still perhaps best known as the Bond villain in Casino Royale, shows just how excellent a performer he is.	Mikkelsen's an actor of restraint, and ...Vinterberg's modern day witch hunt tale gives the actor a whole range of restraint to work with in a film whose title begins literally, turns figurative, then, in a chilling coda, suggests a merging of the two.	Anchored by Mads Mikkelsen's sympathetic performance, The Hunt asks difficult questions with the courage to pursue answers head on.
Director George Miller obscures Updike's original version with senseless special effects.	Really stylish, undervalued comedy fantasy.	Superbly played horror-comedy; a delight	...at its best whenever Nicholson or Cartwright are on the screen.	Jack Nicholson is at his mischievous best in this wildly entertaining battle of the sexes.	A wickedly funny tale of three witches and their duel with the Devil, fuelled by some delicious fantasy and arch comedic performances.
In theory, I suppose it would be funny-and incongruous-if in the middle of a serious costume drama a noble action hero uttered a four-letter word. Hearing Danny McBride do just...	Falls instead into a deep chasm of such comic lowness after less than five minutes that it's unable to extricate itself. Things get so bad you half expect a cameo by Nicolas Cage.	"Your Highness" is ... built on a flimsy house of profane cards that begins crumbling with the opening narration and never recovers.	I got the idea, because of the title, that 'Your Highness' would be a stoner comedy. It is in a couple of spots. More than that, though, it's a just-serviceable, grownups-only nod to other medieval fantasy movies.	The movie's improvisatory recklessness often relies on stock, fallback comedy: scenes lazily punchlined on four-letter words, pot slang, and gay jokes only offensive in their unoriginality.	Big budgets and costumes in service of scatalogical jokes may seem funny on paper, but in execution this is a highly monotonous romp that registers only occasional laughs.
Unspectacularly effective and provocative, Shattered Glass successfully dramatizes individual dilemma that carries over into major social implications.	About as well executed as any movie I've seen this year.	Through Christensen's economical soft-shoe performance, Glass's zeal and obliging modesty work the same disarming hoodoo on the viewer as they do on his snake-oiled co-workers	It takes craft, insight and expert delivery to make an 'insider' story interesting to those on the outside. And that's exactly what Shattered Glass does.	While we never find out why Glass did what he did, the tale of how it all fell apart is a good one.	A compelling look at Stephen Glass' fall from grace.
...chick flick city...a ménage ŕ trois-lite...agonizing to watch poor Emily Blunt laugh uproariously at contrived, slice of life conversation made with her sister	It certainly shows that fine films don't need big budgets, capturing some sweet lightning in an arresting bottle indeed.	...a deft blending of comedy and drama. It may not be the most credible film of the year, but I found it diverting and enjoyable.	No question that Shelton and her cast share a remarkable collaborative rapport.	The dialogue was largely improvised during a 12-day shoot, and the chemistry between the leads appears effortless.	Superbly acted and satisfyingly engaging, Your Sister's Sister subverts rom-com conventions with sensitive direction, an unconventional screenplay, and a big heart.
Ginormous in both scale and emotional wallop, MGM's epic is still a cinematic event to be savoured.	Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh create their own sizzle as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara in a lavish four-hour epic that juxtaposes scenes of jaw-dropping majesty with moments of elegant intimacy and playful verbal jousting.	But once the story kicks in and Leigh and Gable slip into their characters, it's difficult not to be caught up in what is still one of the most vivid depictions of civil war (and its destructive aftermath) ever committed to film.	It could be -- and should be -- viewed from a dozen different perspectives, but it is, above all, a story about adapting to the most challenging circumstances possible.	Even though the habits of movie- goers have changed over the years, it's easy to see why this film provoked such an outpouring of praise and adulation during its initial release, and why its stature has grown with the passage of decades.	Filmed and presented on a scale not seen in modern productions, Gone with the Wind is, if not the definitive Hollywood film, then certainly near the top of the list.
The movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime, and the fanatical excess built into it.	Otomo's typically sophisticated script ensures slick pacing, combining humour, terror and pathos, particularly in the final scenes.	A fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in Japanese animation.	Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting, and always a beauty to behold.	A jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliché of Japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage.	A remarkable technical achievement, Metropolis' eye-popping visuals more than compensate for its relatively routine story.
"Man, I could be doing my laundry," I groused, as Clooney looked deep into the camera's eyes and gave me nothing.	Solid, complex character study from the team that's single-handedly championing the genre. This one finds the ever-improving George Clooney as a legal "fixer".	As with the Bourne films, Gilroy has a knack for creating strong characters and situations that resonate with tension.	There are more than ample rewards for discerning adults: Some of the best dialogue in a recent movie and a gallery of unforgettable performances.	Full of plausible characters who are capable of surprising - and surpassing - your expectations.	Michael Clayton is one of the most sharply scripted films of 2007, with an engrossing premise and faultless acting. Director Tony Gilroy succeeds not only in capturing the audience's attention, but holding it until the credits roll.
It remains one of the best examples of sustained tension.	Read the review on the 2003 Director's Cut	Watching it again reminded me how remarkably the sound engineers did their jobs.	Just getting to see this freakin' frightening and visually stimulating flick on a big screen makes this well worth a trip to your homeworld multiplex.	The movie inspired three sequels and remains undeniably frightening. It also marks a significant step in the evolution of modern science-fiction films.	Director Ridley Scott re-edits his 1979 sci-fi classic to produce an elegantly re-mastered film that is as terrifying and effective as ever.
[Burshtein has] reinvigorated a familiar narrative by painting it against an unfamiliar backdrop.	Buhrstein, whose assuredness belies the fact that this is her first film, captures this dilemma mainly through Shira's eyes.	a subtle, elegant movie that brings us into the structured world of Tel Aviv's ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community to show how one young woman navigates the demands of her religion and her family's expectations without losing herself in the process.	Emotional issues an an insular world	Burshtein has achieved a gripping film without victims or villains, an ambiguous tragedy drawing on universal themes of love and loss, self-sacrifice and self-preservation.	Graceful, complex, and beautifully layered, Fill the Void offers a sympathetic portrait of an insulated culture by exploring universal themes.
Tone and pace are absolutely crucial to comedy. If the tone is wrong or the pace is off - by even a hair - the comedy will shrivel up and die. And that's precisely what happens in The Promotion.	This is one of the more original movies of the year, and it's the rare film that's primarily about the workplace.	Fails as a comedy because it's less funny and interesting than it would be to watch stars Seann William Scott and John C. Reilly sitting in lawn chairs and talking for 90 minutes.	Director Steve Conrad probably counts on the natural likability of Scott and Reilly to make this comedy go down a little easier, but it doesn't always do the trick.	Not that there aren't some great laughs, but this is far from the laugh-a-minute yuck-fest some might expect.	With a workplace-related theme worthy of satire, The Promotion features some sharp witticisms but ultimately disappoints.
Disgrace is an ugly movie, at times torturous to watch. It probably needs to be.	Though overwrought in its early scenes, the movie quickly settles into an intelligently faithful rendering of a calling to account, whose visceral power and political implications need no hyping.	Malkovich gives a compelling and touching performance as a lit professor who embarks on a journey of discovery and self-evaluation after being involved in a sex scandal with a student, forced to confront the new realities of the post-apartheid era.	A lethal look at the after-shock of apartheid. Tough to watch but bearing a powerful message.	Demanding but ultimately rewarding...	Featuring outstanding performances from John Malkovich and newcomer Jessica Haines, Disgrace is a disturbing, powerful drama.
It's the elements that Hollywood usually neglects - the characters, the dialogue and the humour - that makes The Avengers such an unadulterated pleasure.	Shrug however you might at a story that has to pack so many characters and tangents into 140 minutes; it will still be difficult for me to see beyond the joyous awesomeness.	The Avengers is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. It's smart, fast, unrelenting fun. An instant, nuanced classic.	The movie engages the viewer from a very strong opening sequence through the two bonus scenes included in the closing credits. The nearly two and a half hour running time passes by swiftly and leaves you eagerly awaiting a follow-up sequel.	Though overlong and inevitably burdened by the need to juggle so many protagonists, the film is robustly entertaining and manages to maintain a playful, crowd-pleasing spirit.	Thanks to a script that ephasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies.
A worn rock skipping along a smooth, glassy surface.	Zach Braff's appeal ... is his ability to underplay the comedy, to appear befuddled and intimidated as madness surrounds him.	Braff has an ear for dialogue. ... The pauses, the search for words - the right words - overflow from Braff's script. It ... deserves an original screenplay Oscar nomination.	It's a forgettable film featuring a throw-away story with unmemorable characters and unremarkable performances.	Braff clearly loves these characters, and his enthusiasm for them ultimately carries the day.	Delivering a quirky spin on familiar twentysomething tropes -- with a cannily-placed soundtrack -- Garden State has enough charm to mark a winning debut for first-time director Zach Braff.
La tecnología actual resulta en muchas ocasiones contraproducente, ya que mientras más tecnificado se encuentra el ser humano es más fácil quitarle su identidad propia	It's enough to restore my confidence in Hollywood's ability to put out a pretty good movie and a popcorn-muncher at the same time.	Totally satisfying!	As a simple thriller that wants only to excite and intensify, it's one of the better ones that the late '90s produced.	The movie has plenty of high-tech power, spinning out action so explosive you'll hardly notice how preposterous the story is or how cardboard-thin the characters are.	An entertaining, topical thriller that finds director Tony Scott on solid form and Will Smith confirming his action headliner status.
One of King Corman's finest pictures.	In the end, it reveals itself to have nothing to say beyond the superficial about government or rebellion. And in the absence of such a statement, it becomes what it seems to have mocked -- a spectacle glorifying the car is an instrument of violence.	Unwatchable car wreck of an exploitation film.	Don't miss it.	Death Race 2000 is as Corman as his B-grade action pics come, with cars flying through the frame, blood spilling behind them, and overnight pit-stops for some sex ("navigators" in each car keep their drivers juiced up).	Death Race 2000 is a fun, campy classic, drawing genuine thrills from its mindless ultra-violence.
A blistering and convincing documentary designed to spur reform for a new system of universal health care.	Hard-hitting, informative, wise and engaging muckracking documentary.	In another lifetime, Michael Moore and George W. Bush probably would have been great friends.	Sicko, which takes on America's profoundly profitable and catastrophically inefficient health care system, is Moore's most assured, least antagonistic and potentially most important film.	Soon we realize that Sicko hinges not on what Michael Moore is uncovering, but on what he's hiding. This is a real shame as he's a talented documentary maker.	Driven by Michael Moore's sincere humanism, Sicko is a devastating, convincing, and very entertaining documentary about the state of America's health care.
The ambiguous ending leaves the crimes and the dark happenings unexplained. The movie will remind you of M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village" (2004) and Lars von Trier's "Dogville" (2003).	A fantastically controlled, deeply spooky film from one of the most accomplished directors currently working in cinema.	A meticulously constructed, precisely modulated tapestry of malice and intrigue in a rural village in pre-World War I northern Germany.	Haneke has made a deeply unsettling and gravely beautiful film that tells us very little. But the performances are astonishing, and the faces of the children, caught in long, static close-ups, may haunt you for a long time.	Something of a distant Teutonic cousin to Henri-Georges Clouzot's caustic Le Corbeau, White Ribbon amply displays Haneke's filmmaking mastery.	The White Ribbon effectively utilizes tension and a bleak atmosphere to deliver a thought-provoking examination of nascent fascism.
A scrubbed-clean fantasy, the story of privileged people living lives taken straight from catalogs.	A romantic comedy in which Meryl Streep, but not the audience, laughs a lot.	Mixing elements of frisky French farce with middle-class American comedy, It's Complicated is a daffy and delectable spree.	If you're in the mood for a delightful, middle-aged romantic comedy, this is your ticket. It's a glossy holiday confection that's chock full of laughter.	While making a few pithy observations about the mid-life condition, it's no more complicated - or profound - than a racy issue of Hello!	Despite fine work by an appealing cast, It's Complicated is predictable romantic comedy fare, going for broad laughs instead of subtlety and nuance.
There ought to be a law against what they do to Morgan Freeman in High Crimes.	Conventional, with a twist you'll probably guess, but absorbing because of Ashley Judd's forceful performance.	High Crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience.	High Crimes doesn't exactly get a high-five from me, but it doesn't commit any felonies, either. I'll give it 2-3 with time off for good behavior.	Mediocre thriller of the betrayed-woman genre.	Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman make this predictable affair watchable.
Wallow in it.	Nichols takes his time unravelling Mud and Ellis's entwined fates, but his characters are so rich that it's well worth being in their company.	A modern fairy tale, steeped in the sleepy Mississippi lore of Twain and similar American writers, and with a heart as big as the river is wide.	Mud is a movie of striking performances and memorable images and of people who seem to belong in rather than being imposed upon their environment.	McConaughey is terrific but the picture is really made by the fierce and unforgettable performance of Tye Sheridan as Ellis.	Bolstered by a strong performance from Matthew McConaughey in the title role, Mud offers an engaging Southern drama that manages to stay sweet and heartwarming without being sappy.
This Coen Brothers adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel may be their darkest film yet. It's also one of their best.	The most fascinating element of the film is its formal linking of its multiple, no-nonsense protagonists. [Blu-Ray review]	Spanish actor Javier Bardem should leave audiences gasping with his stone-cold performance in the blood-spattered saga No Country For Old Men.	It's the Coen's masterpiece.	The Coen Brothers make the same old story exciting again by telling the entire story in action. Nobody explains their plans, they just see what they have to do and do it. It's all clear, and it's never slow.	Bolstered by powerful lead performances from Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones, No Country for Old Men finds the Coen brothers spinning cinematic gold out of Cormac McCarthy's grim, darkly funny novel.
This isn't just a characterization of a man going through a transition to the issue of mortality, but it's also a transformative performance by an actor rising in depth.	It's not a perfect movie, but this hard-edged film ends up being fully engaging thanks to another powerful performance from McConaughey.	If the camera occasionally suffers a fashionable case of the jitters, the movie transcends its agitated verismo to impart dramatic and behavioral truth.	Does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey.	Though a spotty second half reveals its limitations, this story of one man's crusade against the virus soars thanks to the stellar performances of its two leads.	Dallas Buyers Club rests squarely on Matthew McConaughey's scrawny shoulders, and he carries the burden gracefully with what might be a career-best performance.
The poster for this movie shows Martin Lawrence in fat-lady drag tugging at a wedgie. This is as funny as it gets...In other words, it's not just disappointingly lackluster, derivative, and lazy, it's also out of touch and creepy.	Usually, you can tell when an actor is enjoying himself in a role, but I honestly couldn't tell whether Lawrence was having fun or simply exploiting the character for a second dip at the box office. I just hope he has no reason to do it again.	Happiness is an actor in a fat suit, or at least that is what Hollywood thinks	Putting the 'low' into low-brow humour, it's a series of sketches in which Martin Lawrence immerses himself into a fat suit and a frock and puts himself into ridiculous situations. Not funny.	If Lawrence makes you laugh, you'd be better off watching him do stand-up.	Unfunny and unoriginal. In other words, a perfect piece of evidence for opponents of pointless movie sequels.
It's hard to muster the attention span to care about Earth's Mightiest Heroes when we know they'll just be back to do it all again in a few years.	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.	Avengers: Age Of Ultron is smart, nimble and recognises that the one way to make yet more scenes of mass destruction involving is to give the story behind them a little heart.	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.	Entertaining as much of "Avengers 2" is, especially when it's just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the "Guardians of the Galaxy" lesson, learned), Whedon's picture meets expectations without exceeding them.	Exuberant and eye-popping, Avengers: Age of Ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel, reuniting its predecessor's unwieldy cast with a few new additions and a worthy foe.
Watching Jane Eyre, I envied those who have never read the book: What would it be like to watch this movie without already knowing all of the story's secrets? Miraculously, Fukunaga preserves much of the book's spooky mysteriousnes.	The story is a little too compact at times but the exquisite performance of Mia Wasikowska makes this film stand out.	The acting of the two leads, Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska, is the best element of this stark, spare, sporadically involving version of Bronte's classic novel.	This particular screen version never generates a lot of heat or intrigue	Wasikowska is the revelation here -- her wary, intelligent face tells us volumes about this abused but unbowed young woman. But the small roles are also beautifully cast.	Cary Fukunaga directs a fiery and elegant adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel, and Mia Wasikowska delivers possibly the best portrayal of the title character ever.
If you're looking for ferocious, visceral suspense, Kathryn Bigelow delivers with this graphic, subversive portrait of courage under fire, as adrenaline junkies get high on danger.	[Kathryn] Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal...have made the first fictional feature about American soldiers in Iraq that doesn't fall apart, or preach to a choir, or turn into a position paper.	The Hurt Locker might be the first Iraq-set film to break through to a mass audience because it doesn't lead with the paralysis of the guilt-ridden Yank. The horror is there, but under the rush.	This is a film that doesn't distract with big self-aggrandizing political statements, but nevertheless succeeds in nailing the horror of the war.	Don't be afraid to dive right in for a harrowing, credible and astonishingly made portrait of bravery and brutality.	A well-acted, intensely shot, action filled war epic, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War.
Each frame is exquisitely framed, the acting is superb ... and the impermanence of the lives of displaced Afghans is hauntingly expressed.	A mix of gritty realism, crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in.	The faces of its inarticulate characters tell the story, and Majidi has put some amazing faces on the screen.	Lovely and poignant. Puts a human face on a land most Westerners are unfamiliar with.	Heartbreaking and laugh-out-loud funny, sometimes apart, sometimes together.	The lyrical Baran is a moving film, both for its love story and political underpinnings.
Careens from comedy to drama without warning, and pivots unsuccessfully between being a straightforward story and an expansive metaphor.	Well-acted by Sass and the very likable Brühl.	The impulses to entertain and enlighten are at odds here, and the final result ends up landing somewhere in between: smart, funny, but rarely both at the same time.	sappy and unrealistic	It is no doubt filled with references and in-jokes we do not quite understand. But the central idea travels well.	Funny and poignant social critique of German reunification.
This is a picture that looks spectacular.	...The strengths can't overcome the fact that the texture of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is overly ambitious, and leaves the viewer with a slightly frustrated feeling	A surprisingly effective film, touching and knowing and, like Deneuve, ageless.	The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is inspired as much by René Clair's innovative French classic of 1930, Sous les toits de Paris, and the prewar Pagnol Marseilles trilogy (Marius/Fanny/César) as by Hollywood.	Virtually a genre of its own, this Gallic pop-opera-candy-colored-romantic-tragedy should be seen to be believed.	Jacques Demy elevates the basic drama of everyday life into a soaring opera full of bittersweet passion and playful charm, featuring a timeless performance from Catherine Deneuve.
Johnson is strong enough to come in with a great conceptual finish, one which links his loopers to a more universal 'cycle of vengeful violence.'	Best stay focused and avoid a loo break!	"Looper" shows a good deal of evidence of [Johnson's] ability to deal with complex issues in an engaging manner, but it also shows that he knows how to put together an intriguing story with the material.	Looper may not take us back to the future as satisfyingly as Robert Zemeckis' Marty McFly trilogy or James Cameron's Terminator franchise, but writer-director Rian Johnson does enough right to all but guarantee that he has a future cult film on the books.	An ingenious, witty film that simply brims with ideas and energy.	As thought-provoking as it is thrilling, Looper delivers an uncommonly smart, bravely original blend of futuristic sci-fi and good old-fashioned action.
[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.	Rather than just revel in the absurdity of it all, this film can be accused of being too stony-faced in parts.	Harrison Ford's performance is the big surprise in this otherwise wonky, frequently shambling tall tale.	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.	A middling romance intended as counter-programming before a summer of world-savers and life-takers, The Age of Adaline is an adequate way to kill a few mortal hours in the theater for romance fans.	The Age of Adaline ruminates on mortality less compellingly than similarly themed films, but is set apart by memorable performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
Semi-Pro is beyond resuscitation thanks to about three decent gags throughout. On the rollercoaster track that is now Ferrell's career, this is close to a new low. And after turkeys like Bewitched, that's saying quite something.	You can't help but marvel, and laugh at, Ferrell's indefatigable enthusiasm and willingness to make a complete ass of himself.	Semi-Pro is just Will Ferrell doing the same man-boy shtick he usually does.	Chillingly devoid of laughs, and looks like some deconstructionist experiment, deliberately draining the comedy genre of jokes to show the parched, pointless story-skeleton beneath.	[Reaches] a point of such creative bankruptcy that Ferrell stands poised to become as tiresome a screen jester as Robin Williams.	Semi-Pro is an intermittently funny, half-hearted attempt at sports satire, and one of Will Ferrell's weaker cinematic efforts.
Something that the whole family can love.	The most exhilarating passages in White's book have been omitted.	A wonderful movie, one of the year's best live action family offerings and a great example of non-intrusive CGI.	Stuart Little gives good squeak.	Stuart Little doesn't have the exuberant inspiration or seamless, polished dazzle of Toy Story 2, but if the latter is sold out at the multiplex this weekend, the mouse is a passable substitute.	Critics say Stuart Little is charming with kids and adults for its humor and visual effects.
Schlock, but amusing schlock.	It's not just amateurish, it's completely inept from premise to execution.	I don't know if you're tired of terrified girls racing through shadowy basements pursued by masked slashers while the soundtrack pulses with variations on the Halloween theme, but I am. Real tired.	The script for Urban Legends: Final Cut was the best of 30 different takes from different combinations of writers. That's far scarier than anything in the movie.	Offers all the gore but few of the laughs or chills of its more successful predecessors.	This teen horror movie brings nothing new to an already exhausted genre. And it's bad. Really bad.
If its scenes of tribal violence feel overly familiar to viewers of 2004's Hotel Rwanda, its account of desperate choices made in the throes of terror remains emotionally powerful viewing.	A difficult sell because of the way it clutches its privileged white perspective. But from any perspective, the story it tells is so dramatic, so riveting, that it's impossible to maintain any judgmental distance.	Director Michael Caton-Jones doesn't go for obvious pathos or simple outrage. He approaches the picture's theme with a documentary realism that, scene by scene, heightens the drama.	The film chronicles man's inhumanity to man during the Rwandan genocide of 1994, (where) selflessness and selfishness stand side by side ----	By dodging cultural and political specifics in favor of a thriller-lite framework Beyond the Gates ends up serving largely as a tribute to the virtues of hindsight.	Complex, human characters and on-location shooting give Beyond the Gates palpable tension and urgency.
To a degree, Fast Food Nation gets the job done, not least because of a harrowing section, late in the film, made up of actual slaughterhouse footage.	You wish that Linklater had less of the slacker in his filmmaker soul and maybe more of the spirit of early Warner Bros.	Decidedly spineless and not exactly all that eye-opening.	These vignettes pay inconsistent dividends.	Richard Linklater's Fast Food Nation is major. It's an angry movie that could shame a Big Mac lover into having a salad.	Despite some fine performances and memorable scenes, Fast Food Nation is more effective as Eric Schlosser's eye-opening non-fiction book than as Richard Linklater's fictionalized, mostly punchless movie.
A stirring lament for good human beings caught in the crossfire of history.	This account of the British-Irish conflict is too conventional as narrative and too detached as melodrama, resulting in a passable work that's inferior to Ken Loach's sronger political films	Powerfully authentic, gripping and emotionally shattering.	This is one heck of a scary movie.	Murphy is terrific in the central role and his softly spoken, essentially passive demeanour is used to powerful effect...	Bleak and uncompromising, but director Ken Loach brightens his film with gorgeous cinematography and tight pacing, and features a fine performance from Cillian Murphy.
Wonderland is a modest tale, but one that leaves a lingering sense of sweet hope in its wake.	This small-scale saga is blessed with talented players.	It's a wonderful feature debut script by Laurence Coriat, inspired by Robert Altman's Short Cuts and with a less sprawling nod to Magnolia.	One of those rare films in which everything comes together.	Wonderland is so bereft of hope that it's a chore to withstand.	A film that tackles something as simple as everyday life and succeeds beatifully. The witty script and clever direction keep the film flowing, while the superb acting keeps it alive. It doesn't aim for the sky and for that reason it hits its mark.
...star Mads Mikkelsen is becoming internationally known and while he delivers another fine performance here it is Rolf Lassgĺrd who proves the revelation as the billionaire with a huge hidden agenda.	A serious adult drama that, in the wrong hands, would have certainly been a cloying mess. Instead, it's a riveting character study/soap opera.	Bier's insistence on adding even more melodramatics into the mix feels like a mistake.	For a filmmaker who's so attracted to psychological discomfort, Bier has a disarming affinity with the pleasure principle. In this she's further blessed to have cast the riveting Mikkelsen, who here displays the self-conscious jitter of the young Pacino.	A deeply intimate tale of regret and hope, with characters that will linger in your thoughts.	The cast brings After the Wedding's melodramatic script to life, creating a movie that is emotionally raw and satisfying.
While it isn't really worth the trip to the theater, it's good enough for a rental when it comes out on video.	Whatever It Takes is light, fluffy, fast-paced, and through the sludge of overdone ideas are a couple original moments.	Like some kind of perverse cinematic plague, the teen comedies keep coming, each looking like a more washed-out xerox of the last one.	Although the film shamelessly rips off plot lines, characters and incidents from the play about Cyrano, TV shows and other movies... it still manages to entertain.	Tepid, predictable fantasy.	Whatever It Takes is another run-of-the-mill teeny-bopper romance flick. Cliche jokes and a tired plot capture few laughs.
Pritikin's shrewd comedy-drama catches a fine flock of family emotions on the wing, and not the over-exposed ones.	Set at an odd pitch, one best described as shrill.	A mildly engaging addition to that curious sub-genre of American independent filmmaking, the whimsical comedy of Long Island alienation.	Definitely lives down to its name -- you can see the lips moving on this wooden thing.	What could have been a biting dark comedy is, instead, uninspired and generic.	Dummy is a sweet family comedy that succeeds due to charming performances, even if the final product feels slightly undercooked.
[Team America: World Police is] a roller coaster ride that works most of the time and keeps the laughs coming.	What marks Parker and Stone as satirists rather than shock jocks is their perceptive analysis of the world's craziness.	Do NOT take your children to this movie!!!	It would be abhorrent if it weren't so screamingly funny.	Horribly, wonderfully offensive.	Team America will either offend you or leave you in stitches. It'll probably do both.
A graceful, intelligent movie, and one that gives Casey Affleck a chance to really shine.	In a case where the most dangerous are kept dangerously close, here we have a rarity: a suspenseful, yet dramatic Western.	Stylized like a Ken Burns documentary.	When Ford finally pulls the trigger, it's a relief as the flick's final ten minutes spin into actually interesting terrain	This film is far too long but the central relationship of James and Ford is fascinating.	On the strength of its two lead performances Assassination is an expertly crafted period piece, and an insightful look at one of the enduring figures of American lore.
This progenitor of the series (and the teen slasher genre) still packs the same freshness and dramatic purity it demonstrated 15 years ago.	...a low-key horror effort that's ultimately not quite as enthralling as its premise might've indicated...	Craven knows which big, red Freudian buttons to push, turning Freddy into a true monster from the Id.	...decidedly anti-art - at one point, a teen dozes off while reading Shakespeare - yet it still manages to rank among the top horror movies of all time.	Still stands on its own as an intriguing and chilling example of how horror works best when the characters and the audience don't have to be lobotomized.	Wes Craven's intelligent premise, combined with the horrifying visual appearance of Freddy Krueger, still causes nightmares to this day.
Stylish filmmaking, invigorating and delightfully creepy.	It Follows is a classy, scary horror show: Pass it on.	This brilliantly unsettling, determinedly awkward film confirms that there is plenty of life in the high-end horror movie.	With long-building fears and sudden shocks both in profusion, It Follows is one of the better horror films in recent memory precisely because it turns the border between the everyday and the supernatural into a knife-edge that cuts deep into your fears.	Starting off strong before losing its way in the end, this stylish, suspenseful chiller should significantly broaden Mitchell's audience without disappointing his early supporters in the slightest.	Smart, original, and above all terrifying, It Follows is the rare modern horror film that works on multiple levels -- and leaves a lingering sting.
Genuinely outrageous and sometimes hilarious -- but size does eventually matter, and all-rounder Trey Parker just can't keep it up for the full 81 minutes.	80 minutes of this boring animated comedy/musical feels so long that it will seriously test any moviegoer's patience!	Manages to be both amazingly stupid and clever at the same time.	Yes, it's offensive and rude and lewd and I don't feel comfortable with the idea that kids are probably going to have access to it, but ... man, it's funny!	By the time that opening showtune was over, I was laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. And it only gets funnier.	Its jokes are profoundly bold and rude but incredibly funny at the same time.
It flouts convention in a number of ways in service of its genre-mash-up agenda while still contributing something original to the tradition of the zombie film.	It's likeable enough, and with more teeth than its vampire counterparts in Twilight.	The film's intentions are way too good for its own good, producing bloodless romance and more shamefully bloodless carnage.	Inventive and frequently very funny zomcom with a sharp script and a pair of terrific performances from Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, although zombie movie fans might feel a little cheated in the gore department.	As one might expect from a zombie romance, the film doesn't pack a lot of big ideas. Still, the concept is original, and watching it unfold is loads of fun.	Warm Bodies offers a sweet, well-acted spin on a genre that all too often lives down to its brain-dead protagonists.
A rare on-the-road movie from a female point of view.	In less sensitive hands, Wild could have easily wound up being an Oprah's Book Club episode writ large, but Hornby, Vallée, Witherspoon and Dern lead the charge in taking the material to a higher elevation.	A stunning central performance from Reece Witherspoon as Cheryl Strayed, who overcomes physical hardships to confront her inner demons to find her best self: the woman her mother thought she was	Unlike its female peers, it's not about rejuvenation at some person's or culture's expense. This land isn't her land. The journey itself gets to you, but so does what it stands for. The only way out of the woods is into them.	The movie gets much of the book and has the added benefit of scenery - lots of it, deserts and mountains and forests spreading out to the far horizons.	Powerfully moving and emotionally resonant, Wild finds director Jean-Marc Vallée and star Reese Witherspoon working at the peak of their respective powers.
Winterbottom has given plugged-in moviegoers a visceral, mind-bending meta experience, and some good laughs.	Rest assured, you don't have to know a thing about the Shandy novel -- let alone having read it -- to have a lot of fun with this Cock and Bull Story.	This British import is a good-natured comedy featuring several laugh-out-loud sequences.	As someone who can always be counted on to play a dark, squirmingly funny strain of arrogance and self-delusion, Steve Coogan is like a British Larry David.	More movie-biz spoof than postmodern adaptation of the novel, but Winterbottom's film miraculously succeeds in doing both goals a degree of justice.	Though Laurence Sterne's novel was considered more or less impossible to successfully adapt to film, director Michael Winterbottom has done it in Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story, by making movie about the making of the movie. Stars Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon add madcap, knowing performances to the mix, and the result is a fun, postmodern romp, before there was any modern romp to post.
Memoirs of a Geisha, a dramatic miss, is nonetheless worth seeing for the visual feast it provides.	[T]he film is altogether too much like Sayuri: trying to overwhelm with surface beauty and unspoken emotion, it never hits deeper than the skin.	Says to hell with subtlety--but with a pretty face.	Shows how a small act of kindness, like a pebble thrown into a pond, can send out many ripples, and transform another's life.	I object to the movie not on sociological grounds but because I suspect a real geisha house floated on currents deeper and more subtle than the broad melodrama on display here.	Less nuanced than its source material, Memoirs of a Geisha may be a lavish production, but it still carries the simplistic air of a soap opera.
This is a film though that MUST be seen in a 3D cinema to be appreciated, with genuinely mind blowing visual effects, music and sound that immerse the audience in the Grid and whisk you away on a digitally delightful journey.	Radical, man. All action and escapist fun, 20 years after its sire, the glorious-looking, totally enjoyable Tron Legacy represents a new height in digital cinema and pure entertainment right down to its amazing Daft Punk score.	A visually-stunning, fast-paced amusement ride.	It must have taken a lot of computers to pull this thing off; too bad the movie talks like one of them.	A techno-fueled visual effects extravaganza,Tron Legacy is not quite the sequel I imagined.	Tron Legacy boasts dazzling visuals, but its human characters and story get lost amidst its state-of-the-art production design.
Alex Gibney's documentary based on the book is pretty much straight-ahead journalism	Besides its essential historical importance, the film is filled with telling, chilling, gripping details.	This is a brilliantly executed, brutally entertaining dissection of what one observer called the greatest corporate fraud in American history.	An engrossing parable about power, greed, arrogance, and ethical malfeasance on a grand scale.	goes a long way to explain exactly why Enron imploded	A concise, entertaining documentary about the spectacular failure of Enron.
Ramin Bahrani ("Goodbye Solo") has an extraordinary gift for making intimate dramas that do more than exemplify complex and murky issues; they illuminate them.	A sort of morality play... intense, heartbreaking... Michael Shannon is magnetic.	99 Homes proves that [Ramin Bahrani] can make thrillingly urgent mainstream entertainment without turning his back on the harsh realities of life on the breadline.	Acclaimed indie filmmaker Ramin Bahrani, who regularly and bravely focuses on heartbreaking trials of life while keeping his stories rooted in humanity, turns in some of his finest work here.	A solid movie with two terrific lead performances. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents available)	Fueled by powerful acting and a taut, patiently constructed narrative, 99 Homes is a modern economic parable whose righteous fury is matched by its intelligence and compassion.
The comedy, to the extent there is any, consists mainly of Carrey's verbal asides and strained reactions to people. The script gives him very little to work with.	When a girl who makes 'life happen' meets a guy who needs to 'embrace the possible' -- well, the result ought to be harder to swallow than this generally agreeable romantic comedy.	t's easy to wish that Jim Carrey had declined the chance to appear in this film that celebrates saying "Yes" to life's possibilities.	Jim Carrey's career has succumbed to painfully mediocre comedies and genre missteps for so long that "Yes Man" barely registers even as you're watching it.	Could Jim Carrey Be Playing the One Loan Officer Who Sent Our Economy Into Ruin. Or is the Flick Just Bad?	Jim Carrey's comic convulsions are the only bright spots in this otherwise dim and predictable comedy.
All I have to say is, poor Georgie.	There's a been there, done that quality to this picture for anyone who saw the far nervier, more flamboyant Scarface -- not to mention the far grittier, urgent Traffic.	Depp, an actor of terrific intelligence, insight and range, easily transforms himself from peppy youngster to sad, shambling failure.	A collision of Death of a Salesman with Scarface.	Johnny Depp stars and, despite some pretty awful makeup, nails his performance as George Jung.	With elements that seem borrowed from movies like Goodfellas and Boogie Nights, Blow is pretty much been-there-done-that despite another excellent performance from Johnny Depp. It, also, becomes too sentimental at the end.
Over-analyzing this playful mash-up of pop culture kitsch and high fantasy would be a mistake.	... an improved sequel over the original film, able to build upon the foundation of the first feature and finally put Hellboy in real mortal danger...	After seeing this superior movie, Hancock likely is back in rehab.	On this latest Boy Meets Ghoul: Hellboy II's look is red hot. But it lingers too long on the fire, its promising sizzle ultimately losing flavor.	Prepare for some devil worship. Hellboy is the hottest, strangest and most fun comic book hero around.	Guillermo del Toro crafts a stellar comic book sequel, boasting visuals that are as imaginative as the characters are endearing.
The romance between Huck and Billie isn't credible ... Far better are the scenes between Huck and L.C., and Hanson and Roth make sure to surround this pair with a wide array of interesting characters.	It is amazing how safe Hanson and company play it.	The cuts are obvious, the rhythms sluggish, and the dialogue redundant, as if the movie's afraid you've missed it the first time.	...generally has the feel and tone of a low-key character study...	But Lucky You would be distinctly better if it were shorter in length and clearer about the rules of the game. Its idea that gamblers carry on much the same in life as they do at the tables is hardly original enough to sustain the whole film.	Lucky You tries to combine a romantic story with the high-stakes world of poker, but comes up with an empty hand.
Its assembly alone makes a case for its achieving cinematic heights. It's a work of great confidence, asking its audience to observe, reflect, and feel.	One for the history books.	Simply stating that the movie is nonlinear isn't enough. This is challenging, breathtaking, pretentious, and inspired filmmaking that pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling.	Brandishing an ambition it's likely no film, including this one, could entirely fulfill, The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work, an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankind's place in the grand scheme of things.	...it's the most bold and unconventional and visionary picture made using the apparatus of big-studio pictures since Kubrick's [2001].	Terrence Malick's singularly deliberate style may prove unrewarding for some, but for patient viewers, Tree of Life is an emotional as well as visual treat.
You feel like you're the one moving at 80 mph, not the street lugers.	Transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring, at times sublime, visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the X into the games.	All of this looks great on the giant IMAX screen -- most things do -- but the filmmakers can't shake the sense that this is an inflated TV special.	Uses the IMAX screen to showcase sports rather than talking heads, and the result is 40 minutes crammed with high-energy acrobatics.	It's a dizzyingly entertaining thrill-ride, complete with a pleasantly surprising amount of humor and self-parody.	Taking full advantage of the large IMAX screen, Ultimate X is a thrill ride for extreme sports junkies and novices alike.
Unlike the typical Hollywood romance, its belief in happily-ever-after, even if it has to come from the fourth dimension, feels authentic.	Anderson ... resorts to all sorts of directorial tricks to sustain this shaky premise.	It's nothing like the sappy, crappy rom-coms we're used to seeing.	Once again, director Brad Anderson (of SESSION 9 and NEXT STOP WONDERLAND) has earned the title "maker of chick-flicks that guys can tolerate	Anderson employs a delicate touch in his direction, milking the comedy for all its worth but never losing sight of his story's romance.	Happy Accidents has enough quirkiness and charm to rise above the more formulaic entries in the romantic comedy genre.
Galifianakis's comedy thrives on risk. In G-Force, he does the most subversive thing possible in a big budget PG picture: he plays it straight.	It will possibly be enjoyed by children of all ages.	1 Plexiglas ball sporting 1 hamster was fine for Disney's Bolt. Along comes Bruckheimer -- now it's 3 Plexiglas balls with 4 hamsters, er, guinea pigs, and 1 Transformer. Seems he's hell bent on excess.	A 3D ball of energy, but its furry characters are flatly run-of-the-treadmill.	The joke of cute animals hacking into mainframes and dodging explosions may not be enough to sustain a movie.	G-Force features manic action, but fails to come up with interesting characters or an inspired plot.
This fictionalized documentary will be essential to Cave fans -- it offers some nice, frank insight into the artist's past and his creative process.	I struggled to find a reason to care.	It's unlikely to appeal beyond Cave's core fan base -- but they are sure to love its sheer eccentricity.	No ordinary rock doc, but nothing particularly special either.	The film follows the moods, tones and structure of some quintessential Cave songs; in this way it proves to be an astonishingly thoughtful, respectful, bold and intriguing piece of work. Let's face it, if you're a Cave fan, you're going to love it.	Revealing yet respectful, 20,000 Days on Earth is essential viewing for any Nick Cave fan.
The Ice Storm has delightful moments of humour, but it is essentially a sombre film. But don't let that put you off.	Everyone is uptight, on the verge of breakdown, shrill and too aware of their various audiences. The film captures this sense of 'verge-ness' perfectly.	The Ice Storm is perceptive about people, relationships, and human nature, and there's not a single moment in the entire 112 minute running length that rings false.	Sketched with subtlety and refined detail worthy of Ingmar Bergman.	Beautifully acted, refreshingly un-camp in its take on wide lapels and progressive rock and occasionally coolly moving. It's just that ultimately, there's less here than meets the eye.	Director Ang Lee revisits the ennui-laden decadence of 1970s suburban America with deft humor and gripping pathos.
Under the Same Moon (La Misma Luna) is the nightmare Lou Dobbs has when he goes to sleep at night.	[young Adrian Alonso]...carries the movie with effortless aplomb.	It's a bit of a guilty pleasure, with its formulas and its sap, but if it can get Lou Dobbs reaching for that Kleenex, it will have done its job.	Evoking memories of 'Cinema Paradiso,' it's a gem - one of those rare films that truly touch your heart.	Tries so hard to put a human face on the immigration issue that it ends up feeling as genuine as a plastic Halloween mask.	If Under the Same Moon is often manipulative, it is also heartfelt, and features strong performances from its leads.
Entertaining, without making sense. Film tries to say something about the judicial system, but fails badly. Nevertheless, an intriguing idea. Paul Chambers, CNN.	Shamelessly crass and blatantly stupid. There oughta be laws against films like this.	An illogical, campy joke of a movie that suffers hugely in comparison to F. Gary Gray's earlier ****-the-injustice-system thriller The Negotiator.	Jamie Foxx's Nick mostly repeats the part played by Denzel Washington in Ricochet, the superior first incarnation of Law Abiding Citizen.	Revenge has never been so bland. Much of the fault for the failure of Law Abiding Citizen lands at the feet of its two equally monochrome stars Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler.	Unnecessarily violent and unflinchingly absurd, Law Abiding Citizen is plagued by subpar acting and a story that defies reason.
The movie sucks you in so thoroughly you're actually pissed when you have to swap in a new disc during intermission.	An enduring classic.	Akira Kurosawa captures the convulsive feeling of being alive and crams it inside a single movie. Seven Samurai is The Portable World.	A classic of adventure, a story of honor, a tale of a specific time and place that still has universal resonance.	Kurosawa's film is a model of long-form construction, ably fitting its asides and anecdotes into a powerful suspense structure that endures for all of the film's 208 minutes.	Arguably Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, The Seven Samurai is an epic adventure classic with an engrossing story, memorable characters, and stunning action sequences that make it one of the most influential films ever made.
Spielberg throws you right down there in the middle of all the action, and you have no choice but to experience it.	Spielberg goes a long, long way toward overcoming his tendencies toward the shallow, but the visceral punch of his not-quite-masterful film is softened by an almost neurotic slickness that keeps getting in the way of the [issues it raises].	Saving Private Ryan is a brilliant, savage piece of filmmaking, a soaring paean to the courage of man -- as individual and as family.	Launches and climaxes with two of the greatest extended battle sequences ever put on film.	The result, I am sorry to say, is that Saving Private Ryan seems almost banal in its achievement, a film that sacrifices humanity for technical wizardry.	Anchored by another winning performance from Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre.
Done-in by his own self-importance, Wright overwhelms the story's personal tragedy with extravagant depictions of his love triangle's different fates.	A swoon of thwarted love, Atonement is missing something, the heartrending something that would make an otherwise gorgeous film a romance for the ages.	Some of the most creative and beautiful cinematography of the year combined with the best performances to date by Knightly and McAvoy and earthshaking work by relative newcomer Romola Garai make this one of the best films out there	Director Joe Wright is quickly establishing himself as a powerhouse adapter of period romance tomes.	A lushly shot, proficiently performed, and largely stultifying period piece that invites only mild, detached admiration.	Atonement features strong performances, brilliant cinematography, and a unique score. Featuring deft performances from James MacAvoy and Keira Knightley, it's a successful adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel.
Once the funny and not-so-funny start to flow, you might not care, though it would be nice if the Farrellys did care about the banality of their images, just a little.	Ultimately the film takes a long time to go nowhere.	I laughed from beginning to end and to me that's the sign of a comedy classic.	Is it redundant to note that this Farrelly Brothers picture is rated R, "for crude and sexual humor throughout, language, some graphic nudity and drug use"? If anything here, the Bros are sticking to their brand. Maybe it's time they grew up a little bit.	Potentially funny insights are quickly drowned in a constant stream of bodily fluids, like the sweat of desperation as the Farrellys struggle to recapture their own glory days.	Some filmgoers may be surprised by the Farrellys' defense of traditional domestic values in Hall Pass -- unfortunately, they'll probably also be dismayed by the absence of laughs.
Watching as a pimp, a pothead and a pregnant hooker play and sing in a makeshift bedroom recording studio, and becoming increasingly caught up in their determination and hope, it's impossible not to think that this is a part of the American Dream, too.	Meditative and fierce, quiet and pounding, HUSTLE AND FLOW runs the board in a way that few films even attempt.	Never moves beyond its own clichés.	A great turn by Terrence Howard [and] real sympathy spun like gold from Taraji P. Henson.	With Terrence Howard's performance providing the hook, [director] Brewer provides a flow of schemes, dreams and rap rhymes that take us on a journey inside a man's soul.	Hustle & Flow is gritty and redemptive, with a profound sense of place and exciting music.
Beautiful as the film is to look at, it stays past its welcome and ultimately fails to satisfy.	The result, while not a substitute for the original, will still astound audiences with its mesmerizing vision.	Calling this film a 'kid's film,' however, completely misses the point. It is instead a film for the young at heart and those who still appreciate honor, valor, love, and the earth.	Here is a film that reaches for unforeseen heights, and surpasses them.	An animated fable of dazzling artistry, one of the most beautiful ever made.	With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, Princess Mononoke is a landmark in the world of animation.
The big problem with Hitchhiker, and it is a crucial one, is that the middle section of the film really isn't that interesting.	While it won't win any awards, it's fun as a time killer.	"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" is an enjoyable sci-fi romp with a strong twist of self-effacing British raillery that children of all ages will get a charge from.	...character interactions and relationships have been jettisoned in favor of wild gesticulations, frantic emoting and a heap of commotion.	A lot of fun and something different, poised to reach a broader audience with its silly and spirited tour of space -- which is vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big, by the way.	A frantic and occasional funny adaptation of Douglas Adams' novel. However, it may have those unfamiliar with the source material scratching their heads.
Producer-director John Sturges has fashioned a motion picture that entertains, captivates, thrills and stirs.	...when the term blockbuster too often suggests digital special effects or a place to rent movies, The Great Escape reminds us of the true meaning of the word.	Even if you feel you know every scene backwards, there are still manifold pleasures here beyond nostalgia.	One of the greatest 'popcorn' movies ever	With its luxurious three hours, the film deliberately details all the ins and outs, the successes and pitfalls of the plan.	With its impeccably slow-building story and a cast for the ages, The Great Escape is an all-time action classic.
The absurdity of the story bothered me. Not the fantasy premise of the deathless person moving through the ages or even the changing of sex, but for the idea that Orlando could have lived so long and apparently remained so vapid and lacking in insight.	A daring, daunting, playful work of some considerable intellectual force that just misses greatness owing to a lack of emotional weight.	Eighteen years after its initial theatrical release, "Orlando" returns to theaters with all of its original allure intact, and then some.	Potter possesses a natural gracefulness in presentation that helps a little but, finally, not nearly enough. Orlando is vague when she means it to be mysterious, coy when it ought to be witty, familiar when it should be bold.	A silly and serious work of art that isn't afraid to entertain.	Orlando can't match its visual delights with equally hefty narrative -- but it's so much fun to watch that it doesn't need to.
The Company Men may well be the last of Hollywood's Recession Specials, but let's not get our hopes up unreasonably.	It's not that being privileged makes them boring; being two-dimensional does.	If you're looking for a film that puts a face to some of the least sympathetic victims of the financial crisis The Company Men will happily take your $10. For the rest of us, there's always whatever's on cable. That is, if it hasn't been disconnected.	John Wells gives a notable tyro writing/directing debut with "The Company Men" and he shows a deft hand at marshaling his large cast and complex story.	This is a film without spark. The frustrations are real, but they are neither terribly entertaining nor enlightening.	It might be hard for most viewers to identify with The Company Men's well-heeled protagonists, but writer/director John Wells uses their plight to make universally resonant points -- and gets the most out of his excellent cast.
Scorsese nails nearly every scene perfectly. There's not a moment your mind wanders, your toe taps restlessly or you dare to miss a scene by glancing at your watch.	... shifts between action and absurdity, generating the kind of gleeful havoc where you're laughing one minute, then choking as the laughter freezes in your throat.	Scorsese hurries through scenes with an impatience that suggests boredom. Spontaneous violence doesn't shock us anymore in Scorsese's environments. Even the director's reliable technicians let him down.	Martin Scorsese must have missed the memo stating that Hollywood movies were being dumbed down for mass audiences. The director has created one of the best films of the year, guaranteed to keep audiences on their toes.	Scorsese's latest is an anti-war movie that is firmly dedicated to the idea that neither side in this war will ever be declared the winner.	Featuring outstanding work from an excellent cast that includes Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon, The Departed is a thoroughly engrossing gangster drama with the gritty authenticity and soupy morality that has infused director Martin Scorsese's past triumphs.
Yogi Bear barely raises a grin, it's only Miller and Daly's charisma and ad-lib that goes some way to saving it.	"Yogi Bear" lacks even the zinging toddler anarchy of the "Alvin and the Chipmunks" movies.	Like a steady, throbbing ache that, after 75 minutes, you realize was your nerve endings' collective scream at your numbed-off brain to flee this awkward hybrid of animation and live-action. The humans are even more cartoonish than 'your a-ver-age bear.'	Little Boo Boos might giggle at the slapstick, but most folks over the age of 5 will find the tired plot and lame jokes unbearable.	The movie is the opposite of the cartoons: Everyone's body is in motion, but nobody is using his head.	Yogi Bear's 3D effects and all-star voice cast are cold comfort for its aggressively mediocre screenplay.
Klopt elementen van een Agatha Christie whodunnit, een frivole chansonmusical en de kleurrijke melodramas van Douglas Sirk op tot een luchtige souffle, als is de kooktijd wel wat lang.	...a través de la canción, los personajes hablan de su verdadero sentir o de su estado de ánimo, un monólogo profundo pero en pleno toque cómico...	A delectable, frothy, often over-the-top 1950s murder mystery by director Francois Ozon.	Simply to name the eight actresses ... is to indulge in an iconic incantation that has less to do with traditional film criticism than with spiritual speculation on the eloquent intimations of immortality in the ageless cinema of faces.	Drop-dead pretty and confidently assembled, it's a shameless, extravagant charmer -- at first. As the movie goes on, it goes deeper, too, until the bleak melancholia that lurks beneath the surface violently breaks through.	Featuring some of the best French actresses working today, 8 Women is frothy, delirious, over-the-top fun.
The action sequences go on too long and the reliance on CGI is often blatant, but Cruise's irrepressible zest and Diaz's ditsy charm pull the film through the rough patches.	Fast-paced and charming, Knight and Day may well restore the box office fortunes of its well-matched leading man and lady. It's the Mr. & Mrs. Smith of 2010.	Reiser Mangold Noć i dan čini koliko-toliko gledljivim, ali ni toliko da bi dosegao uobičajene i niske standarde "neobavezne ljetne zabave".	Its about as light and fluffy as summer action movies get. It's also as relentless and desperate to entertain as we always hope the worst summer movies won't be.	When you combine the right actors with correct chemistry and some decent writing, even formula works.	It's pure formula, but thanks to its breezy pace and a pair of charming performances from Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, Knight and Day offers some agreeably middle-of-the-road summer action.
The movie knows how to have fun with this strange way of thinking and still make it seem human.	From the bare bones of the plot, it would be easy to mistake "Together" for a sexy romp. Moodysson has more on his mind than that, however.	Together's portrait of its social moment is right-on.	Moodysson is an observant filmmaker, and best of all, sees the many sides of human personality that make people by turns maddening, exciting and sympathetic.	It's a joyful movie (how can a movie with an ABBA sing-along not be?), but there's sadness too, since communes aren't spoken of much anymore.	Managing to be both satirical and warm-hearted in its look at the inhabitants of a commune, Together successfully captures the spirit of a time.
Watching them lock lips feels like incest propaganda: Justin and Kelly are offspring of the same publicity machinery, after all	...schmaltzy...sitting through the bubble gum banality of FJTK is enough to make poor Beach vets Frankie and Annette (and the rest of us for that matter) bury their delusional heads in the sand.	[Guarini] is a hopeless case. ... [But] acting lessons and a costume designer who can flatter her non-anorexic figure could turn Clarkson into a movie star.	This too-many -generations-removed copy of Where the Boys Are (1960) is crammed with energetic but artless musical numbers that feature lip-synching multitudes and uninspired choreography.	Colorful but decidedly brain-dead...just a mediocre piece of fluff, and the fact that it could have been worse isn't much consolation.	A notorious stinker, From Justin To Kelly features banal songs, a witless plot, and non-existent chemistry between its American Idol-sanctioned leads.
Hang on to your wallets, mom and dad.	Pikachu has very little to do with the plot, so die-hard fans may be disappointed. On the other hand, I daresay die-hard fans could not possibly be discriminating enough to notice, since most of them are still in diapers.	Just another plastic accessory in the wildly popular world of Pokemon.	Slightly better than a poke in the eye.	Saying that Pokemon 2000 is better than Pokemon is like saying that breaking both legs is better than having your tongue pulled out.	Despite being somewhat more exciting than the previous film, this kiddy flick still lacks any real adventure or excitement. What is does contain is choppy animation and poor voice acting. Doesn't match up to virtually anything out there.
A voyeuristic look at one American and his broken family	A remarkable and profoundly sad experience.	A psalm, a piercing, deeply absorbing document of a thousand shades of gray. What gives Stevie its engrossing complexity is, of course, its unshackled, unflinching humanity.	Stevie is a brave work, with a deeply personal touch that few documentaries ever achieve.	Deeply human, consummate reportage.	Poignant documentary that's hard to forget.
It seems like McKay is always able to bring out the best in Ferrell, and their latest collaboration, the mismatched-buddy cop comedy The Other Guys, is thankfully more of the same.	This is one of the best comedies of the summer, though perhaps that says more about the quality of films in 2010 than The Other Guys itself.	Often silly, but very, very funny and well-cast. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg have terrific chemistry and impeccable comic timing. It's one of the best buddy flicks since Rush Hour.	When The Other Guys focuses on the banter between Ferrell and Wahlberg its shortcomings aren't as noticeable and the laughs come easy and often.	Measured against this year's other police farce -- remember Cop Out? -- it looks absolutely heroic.	A clever parody of cop-buddy action-comedies, The Other Guys delivers several impressive action set pieces and lots of big laughs, thanks to the assured comic chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg.
A luminous central performance from Golshifteh Farahani distinguishes an ambitious if somewhat monotonously wordy adaptation of a prize-winning best-seller.	It's a tragedy streaked with nightmare farce.	An intermittently powerful piece, driven by Farahani's nuanced performance, though eventually its verbosity takes a toll.	A real one-off.	Shines a startling, hugely affecting light on the desperate measures so many women must take to survive in the world's most mercilessly patriarchal cultures.	It may prove frustratingly slow for some viewers, but more contemplative filmgoers will find themselves rewarded by The Patience Stone's quietly fierce storytelling, as well as a searing starring turn from Golshifteh Farahani.
Not particularly well-rounded then, but any film that gives voice to the oppressed while raising global awareness has got to be a good thing.	Burma VJ -- for video journalist -- is filmmaking at its most fearless, with [director] Ostergaard creating a suspenseful, harrowing account of his original key subject, known only as 'Joshua.'	An awe-inspiring documentary by Denmark's Anders Ostergaard that tracks how the news escaped in 2007 during Burma's civil uprising.	No matter how many times anyone tries to appropriate shaky camera techniques, they'll never recreate anything as real as a reporter fleeing heavily armed police.	Anders Ostergaard's documentary mixes a small amount of re-enactment - scenes of the Thai-based boss co-ordinating action by phone - with large amounts of scary, shocking or in some cases infamously celebrated footage.	A powerfully visceral docu-drama highlighting the evils of censorship and the essential need for freedom of speech.
Los que busquen profundidad en la historia se van a sentir algo decepcionados	Banderas puts in a decent turn, but it's Norwegian newcomer Dennis Storhoi who steals the show; his charming, effortless performance shows both the perils and pleasures of being a Viking.	The best, most enthralling adventure movie I've seen in a good while.	Let's face it. Kull: The Conqueror, as dumb and as hokey as it gets, was a lot more fun.	everything is first rate except the characters and the story	Atmospheric, great sets and costumes, but thin plot.
A formidable actor's showcase.	Not only a good movie, but a great one.	The cast includes Frank Sinatra, Montgomery Clift and Ernest Borgnine, all of whom are fine, in what is essentially a melodrama.	From Here to Eternity (1953) is the powerful, realistic story (and fierce indictment) of the lives of American military men (and their women)	Sominex is cheaper and probably safer.	It has perhaps aged poorly, but this languidly paced WWII romance remains an iconic, well-acted film, featuring particularly strong performances from Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift.
For all the uneven visceral enjoyment that it's worth, Touchstone Pictures proudly presents Armageddon: a blockbuster a la carte.	I must confess that at times I found myself rooting for the meteor to hit the Earth and put us all out of our misery.	Of all the Michael Bay films out there, Armageddon is the Michael Bayest.	It's such a thrill ride, in fact, that after its 2 1/2 hours of thrills, you're likely to feel more pummeled than entertained, which is just the point.	Armageddon features some dynamite special effects, but on the whole, it's an empty, almost cynical movie in the way it manipulates its audience.	Lovely to look at but about as intelligent as the asteroid that serves as the movie's antagonist, Armageddon slickly sums up the cinematic legacies of producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay.
This rigorous beautiful black-and-white drama of early-'60s Poland is an art film in the best sense.	For all its sombre subject matter, there is warmth here too; personal, musical, spiritual.	Pawlikowski has a photographer's eye for composition, and every crisp, monochrome frame could be a postcard from Poland's tragic, turbulent past.	It's an intriguing story, crisply told, but the austere, remote style makes it hard to engage emotionally.	Turns what should have been a complex mystery into a simple question and answer.	Empathetically written, splendidly acted, and beautifully photographed, Ida finds director Pawel Pawlikowski revisiting his roots to powerful effect.
A sneak-up-and-touch-you-on-the-shoulder movie, rather than a smash-you-in-the-face-with-an-anvil one, Disturbia is a surprisingly satisfying thriller.	OK, so Rear Window was better plotted and more richly apportioned than this update. And so what if you can see every plot twist bearing down like a rush-hour commuter express? Disturbia still boasts a scrappy charm.	Despite the interesting set-up, the action degenerates into obvious implausibility and silliness - fatal for a suspense thriller - and boredom sets in.	The difficulty of keeping home confinement tense and vital for feature length proves a strain but works as a result of LaBeouf's zany energetic charm.	With a new gore fest being released on a near-weekly basis these days, it's nice to see a thriller come down the pike that gets under your skin the old-fashioned way: without showing you much of anything.	Aside from its clichéd resolution, Disturbia is a tense, subtle thriller with a noteworthy performance from Shia LaBeouf.
"Crude" is a knock-your-socks-off documentary that will leave you speechless. It's the best documentary of the year.	Berlinger gives a good amount of time to the big oil representatives, but it's clear that he's on the side of the people. Aside from that, Crude is a fine work of journalism.	Crude is both a tribute to human-rights tenacity and a sobering account of the multinational-Moloch greed that can keep justice in limbo.	One has to wonder if oil industry executives are concerned about the release of Joe Berlinger's damning documentary.	A well-balanced and thought-provoking documentary that doesn't forget the cinema-going experience needs to entertain as well as educate.	Dynamic, tightly arranged, and deliberately provocative, Joe Berlinger's Crude is a sobering, enraging wake-up call.
...strips Bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness, making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults.	Spears of Afro-topped asparagus singing gospel and French-accented peas working as maitre d's at a seafood restaurant -- what's not to love?	A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking Christian-themed fun.	Jonah is Sunday School lite. But it's told with a comic edge usually associated with the devilish act of laughter.	Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast, funny, and even touching story. Parents may even find that it goes by quickly, because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year, including those intended for adults.	Jonah teaches wholesome messages to children in a funny, bouncy package.
It's a scary film; an atmospheric, unrelenting, character-rich thriller that includes one of the most jolting shock-moments I can remember.	One hopes Rusty Nail just slaughters our trio of bathetic anti-heroes.	...a galvanizing amusement-park ride that only occasionally steps over the bounds of common sense.	They're just driving and screaming and running, making the film come off as yet another teen-scream sequel.	Like going to a fun fear.	A well-constructed B-movie thriller, Joy Ride keeps up the necessary level of tension and chills. Critics also liked Zahn's performance as the goofball older brother.
I walked out of Dogtown almost bouncing...it's a rush, a kinetic spectacle that puts you right back into your own 16 year old shoes...	A secondary, rags-to-riches melodrama that pales in comparison with 'Dogtown and the Z-Boys.'	Entirely sympathetic to its youthful, even bratty characters -- and, by extension, to the youth audience that is likely to respond most enthusiastically to the film.	In her raw, ruff-and-ready style, Hardwicke gets in your face early and often. You just want to tell her, 'Down, girl.'	Directed with skill and assuredness by Catherine Hardwicke.	Lords of Dogtown, while slickly made and edited, lacks the depth and entertaining value of the far superior documentary on the same subject, Dogtown and Z-Boys.
It's a reinforcement of some elements of the first film, but also a departure in ways that make it more thoughtful than its predecessor without ever undermining its commitment to entertain.	With the Kings of Tampa back together and on the road to a male-stripper convention in Myrtle Beach, Magic Mike XXL is the all-out man-party audiences wanted the first movie to be.	It lacks the art of the original, but it does have a hairless stud licking melted chocolate off an obese woman's thighs and spraying her with whipped cream.	It's a simple, entertaining, light-hearted romp that doesn't require much thought.	Supporting players including Jada Pinkett Smith, Andie MacDowell, and Elizabeth Banks have good fun with underwritten roles, and the movie's take on desire is admirably democratic (Sex: it's not just for hot millenials!).	Magic Mike XXL has enough narrative thrust and beefy charm to deliver another helping of well-oiled entertainment, even if this sequel isn't quite as pleasurable as its predecessor.
It should have been wonderful -- a delicious tribute to classic Hollywood -- but it simply doesn't come off.	Soderbergh's film is no more cynical or world-weary than its inspirations, and in the end, it feels like a clever trick wrapped around a hollow center.	No matter that it's based on a book, the movie is more about how the reality of the time was seen through the lens of a Michael Curtiz while he was filming "Casablanca".	Soderbergh's attempt to re-create a 40s film noir might not be for all tastes but Paul Attanasio's script keeps the story engaging long enough.	Casablanca is so explicit a reference in the movie's finale that it drew nervous giggles from the film-savvy audience with which I saw the movie.	Though Steven Soderbergh succeeds in emulating the glossy look of 1940s noirs, The Good German ultimately ends up as a self-conscious exercise in style that forgets to develop compelling characters.
Possessed of a highly literate, almost classical story, the search for the meaning of human life itself, and the unshakable belief that it encompasses much more than skin and bones.	One long, tedious rumination on the blurring distinction between man and machines.	Visually stunning and mentally numbing. Not only will you not be able to understand it...you won't care.	Oshii allows the plot to be overwhelmed by a slew of cockamamie musings on the nature of existence that wouldn't float in a late-night dorm room smokeout.	A rehash that takes a timely theme, mankind's obsession with technology, and bloats it to the point of incomprehension, cramming meaning into dialogue that has none.	The animation is lovely, but the plot is complex to the point of inscrutability, leaving Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence both original and numbing.
It paints a fairly accurate and hard-hitting picture of the racial tensions of the times, but it still glamorizes the gangsters with too much love.	Beautiful story	It's the moralistic tenor of A Bronx Tale that's ultimately most off-putting.	De Niro's feature directorial debut is not a second-tier Scorsese film. Though telling a familiar coming-of-age story, it finds a new angle in depicting the irrational and subconscious origins of racism.	A wonderful, touching tale about growing up and making decisions.	A Bronx Tale sets itself apart from other coming-of-age dramas thanks to a solid script, a terrific cast, and director Robert De Niro's sensitive work behind the camera.
A pleasant enough diversion with some great performances and beautiful cinematography to just make it worth recommending.	Watching Allen fart out a story when he has no characters is always painful.	Allen actually lets his characters have conversations with each other.	While legendary filmmaker Woody Allen can't always be equated with sheer genius and is more accurately described as a hit-or-miss proposition, this sorely undermarketed film serves as unquestionable retribution for his recently questionable work.	[Allen's] funniest movie in years and arguably his sexiest.	A beguiling tragicomedy, Vicky Cristina Barcelona charms with beautiful views of the Spanish city and a marvelously well-matched cast.
In this case, 6-6-6 adds up to 18 reasons why you should wait for the DVD.	Younger viewers may find this new movie more exciting; anyone with a memory of the old Gregory Peck version will most likely feel a sensation of "been there, done that."	...features an alarming number of classy actors getting whacked in the most ghastly and classless of ways.	Overall, The Omen is a slick piece that improves upon the original. And the kid is creepy as hell, too.	You can file the remake of The Omen under 'Unnecessary.' With a cross-reference to 'Uninspired.'	Even with the force of a "classic" behind it, remake fever can't hold up the hollowness of this style-drenched Omen.
It's a good family movie.	Never cloying or abundant with cutesy dialogue...	Fun for kids, I suppose, but hardly worth mentioning otherwise.	Only Ricci, strange gothic child that she is, gets close to shining next to the animation.	The movie is downright sappy.	A meandering, mindless family movie that frequently resorts to special effects and transparent sappiness.
It's a bad sign when audience enthusiasm peaks during the credits sequence.	Shaft is a parody of itself but doesn't even realize it.	Jackson has made the role of Shaft his own regardless of the rewriting that took place around him.	An interesting collection of bad decisions.	Samuel L. Jackson, who broke out of the pack in Pulp Fiction, fits the role and his leather Armani coat as though it's tailor-made. He's the man, and we can dig it.	With a charismatic lead, this new Shaft knows how to push the right buttons.
Antoine Fuqua's version of the King Arthur legend includes an element of broad, brawny camp that prevents the movie from being a complete drag.	It's hard to care about a valiant groping for accuracy when a story is so badly told you can't tell what the devil is going on.	With every step King Arthur takes, it only unravels further.	This middling King Arthur doesn't waste time developing character -- or coherence -- when a big, joyless, synthetic battle will do.	A dim, cruddy collage of Dark Ages, sub-Conan the Barbarian mush. Talk about trashing an awesome bedtime story -- there aren't even any 'Knights who say nee!'	The magic is gone, leaving a dreary, generic action movie.
Given the talents, Poltergeist is an annoying film because it could have been so much better.	Hooper and Spielberg hold our interest by observing the everyday rituals of this family so closely that, since the family seems real, the weird events take on a certain credibility by association.	Poltergeist (1982) is a memorable supernatural horror film from co-producer/co-writer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hopper..	Hooper and Spielberg have worked long and hard to bring the ghost story to its fullest potential. They have succeeded.	After a quarter-century, Poltergeist remains one of the most popular movies whose reputation rests almost exclusively on behind-the-scenes diversions.	Smartly filmed, tightly scripted, and -- most importantly -- consistently frightening, Poltergeist is a modern horror classic.
Remarkably well-directed and played, the crisp images perfectly framed by cinematographer Jürgen Jürges for maximum effect.	This is still the most frightening film you will ever see: unforgettably sadistic, utterly plausible, and totally f---ing terrifying.	Sadistic, insufferable, clever, and relentlessly compelling.	The first half is sadistically intense, Geiring and Frisch make wonderfully creepy psychopaths, and Haneke and cinematographer Jurgen Jurges burnish the film to a high polish that's rare for the genre.	The film outstays its welcome and is more than a little too knowing in its manipulation of standard audience expectations for the genre.	Violent images and blunt audience provocation make up this nihilistic experiment from one of cinema's more difficult filmmakers.
Exhibits many of the genre's common weaknesses, but the fine acting of Edward Norton, Laura Linney and Richard Gere enables us to forgive them.	Edward Norton became an instant star after making a splashy, Oscar-nominated performance in this well-executed horror thriller.	an ambitious film, but also a somewhat muddled one	Helped greatly by excellent performances from both of the film's leads, as well as the rounded supporting cast.	Ed Norton is out of this world in his break-out performance.	A straightforward, entertaining thriller with a crackerjack performance by Edward Norton.
Delivers its romance in a warm, straightforward way with no frills.	Klein's script is at once too airy-fairy and pandering to deliver the charm.	A sugary slab of wish-fulfilment that will have most viewers reaching for the insulin.	Its characters act as if they're slogging through an 85-minute screen exercise, not engaging in anything remotely resembling real life.	The movie forces these two together without ever explaining why they should be together -- except that their faces are on the movie poster.	Light and charming, Serendipity could benefit from less contrivances.
Grease 2 is a bad movie that really doesn't deserve much of a defense. There are moments in it that are so cringeworthy, one might think they were the reason fast-forward buttons were included on VCRs.	It doesn't work, but you could spend the time spotting relatives of the stars.	Yup, it really is THAT bad. Hilariously bad, even.	This movie just recycles Grease, without the stars, without the energy, without the freshness and without the grease.	A gloriously unpretentious gem just waiting to be discovered. That the film hasn't yet received the full respect it deserves only adds to its charm.	Grease 2 is undeniably stocked with solid songs and well-choreographed dance sequences, but there's no getting around the fact that it's a blatant retread of its far more entertaining predecessor.
The Way, Way Back is a funny and wonderfully-told tale about the beginning of one teen's autonomy at a time where everything remains out of his control.	Naxon and Rash succeed in not only creating the emotional attachment to the characters, but also in blending the humor and drama together without having one overpowering the other. As a result, they've crafted one of the best films of the year thus far.	The story has some of the lighthearted fun a boy should have working for a fun-loving boss and enjoying the company of a hot girlfriend, but he should be having a lot more fun than this.	Liam James is the introverted heart of the film, and is somewhat of a revelation. His perfect portrayal of a skittish boy who is forced to become assertive anchors the whole movie and makes it a coming-of-age story worth revisiting.	It doesn't yank on your heartstrings, though you'll be touched gently at last. It doesn't insult your intelligence. (Indeed, it presumes you have some left.)	Despite its familiar themes, The Way Way Back makes use of its talented cast, finely tuned script, and an abundance of charm to deliver a funny and satisfying coming-of-age story.
One of the greatest horror films made. The opening sequence is not only a classic, it's still frightening nearly three decades after it was made.	One of the most effective thrillers ever made.	Killer sharks cause deaths and provide much excitement.	Director Steven Spielberg has constructed a chillingly frightening film.	Like all the best suspense films, "Jaws" manages to somehow remain amazingly tense, even if you've seen the film before. No wonder so many moviegoers went back for repeat viewings.	Compelling, well-crafted storytelling and a judicious sense of terror ensure Steven Spielberg's Jaws has remained a benchmark in the art of delivering modern blockbuster thrills.
Curtis has failed to give us characters we can really like.	Writer-director Richard Curtis is about as rock n' roll as the average great-grandmother, so it's no surprise that Pirate Radio, his ode to the irrepressible spirit of '60s classic rock, has all the electricity of a knitted sweater.	The film itself is not irritating, although it's so relentlessly cheery that it could have been.	It's all got a great backbeat and you can dance to it, but there isn't much to Curtis's rebels except some canned anti-authoritarian, sex-drugs-rock 'n' roll rants.	The film's original title was The Boat That Rocked. Indeed, these freewheeling, swinging '60s DJs braved their own Titanic to keep on rocking in the free world.	The good cast and rollicking soundtrack eventually drown when this comic homage to pirate radio loses its quippy steam.
Completely forgettable (at least, I'm trying to forget it).	David's remorse barely registers against the movie's basking in criminal excess. And with the exception of character actor Tiny Lister, the cast tries way too hard to be tough.	Sure, the bends in logic are nutty, and some of the dialogue is so outrageously street that it's laughable, but the larger-than-life star works it with everything he's got. It's a decent deal.	Worse than you could ever imagine.	Ernest Dickerson's film recycles a cinematic standby -- it's narrated by a corpse, telling us how he got that way -- but the movie's scuzzy beauty keeps it intriguing.	DMX's menacing charisma is put to good use in this stylish but hackneyed modern-day noir.
When the great screen performances of 1988 are considered for Oscar nomination, expect Hoffman's name on the list.	Valeria Golino is appealing as Cruise's girlfriend; Hoffman makes his character pretty believable without milking the part for pathos and tears, and it's nice to see Cruise working for a change in a context that isn't determined by hard sell and hype.	Now as then, it's clear that this was hardly the crowning achievement of its year, yet that's not meant to take away from the film's crowd-pleasing appeal.	Everything about the acting and direction of Rain Man is so exquisitely calibrated and so right that it's all too easy to forget how much could have gone wrong.	What no one can argue is that Rain Man is Cruise's quantum leap, so that it can be said unblushingly that he holds his own with the masterly Hoffman.	This road-trip movie about an autistic savant and his callow brother is far from seamless, but Barry Levinson's direction is impressive, and strong performances from Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman add to its appeal.
A nutty film that boasts at times beautiful photography of some cheap but truly epic sets of PVC and everything that clings.	It is an extravagant exercise in bad taste and camp. While it tries to intentionally funny, some of the humour merely falls flat on its face.	One of the most memorable of comic book adaptations ever conceived...	Campy sci-fi cult classic features violence, nudity.	Without Jane Fonda, there isn't much to talk about. Yet with her, the film is enjoyable to watch, not only because she is so appealing to look at but because she has such a flair for the role.	Unevenly paced and thoroughly cheesy, Barbarella is nonetheless full of humor, entertaining visuals, and Jane Fonda's sex appeal.
Simmons has never been better than he is here, as he transforms Henry from a guy burdened with regret to one bursting with hope.	It's sentimental, yet so honest and eccentric that it rises above schmaltz.	It's an audience-friendly drama about family, conflict and the healing power of music.	It's hard even to describe the film's plot without reflexively mocking its saccharine commodification of some really good music, but there are in fact a few fairly moving moments to be found.	This fact-inspired story from the physician who gave us Awakenings mostly plays like a Lifetime movie.	An involving, if sentimental and predictable family drama elevated by J.K. Simmons' sympathetic lead performance.
Achieves a documentary-level realism that is nothing short of amazing.	A gorgeously-shot and often-funny story... An absolute treat.	Tulpan is an amazing film. It shows such an unfamiliar world, it might as well be Mars.	An emotionally engaging drama that succeeds thanks to its combination of offbeat humour and intriguing characters, set against an almost impossibly bleak landscape.	There's no room for mush in filmmaker Sergey Dvortsevoy's triumphant, intimate drama, not when the necessities of daily life are so elemental, and so tenderly observed.	Kazakh sheep herders get their cinematic due in this lovely, unsentimental debut from director Sergei Dvortsevoy.
Commendable for its daring, unconventional vision of vampires, but its erratic pacing makes it a jarring experience that's hard to adjust to.	Scary is back in the cold deadly way. This horror film contained all the necessary ingredients for a classic fright.	I've seen more creepy vampires, I guess. But the thought of waiting out the ghouls in "30 Days of Night" is pretty interesting.	A frightening genre offering, raising the bar on raising the dead.	This is a failed fright flick that is so inspired by Stephen King that the famous horror scribe should consider suing.	While 30 Days of Night offers a few thrills, it ultimately succumbs to erratic execution.
Ms. Stritch is sharp, funny, brittle, caustic, demanding, exaggerated, critical (especially of herself) and infuriating. She is also elaborately unique and awesomely brilliant.	There's something indomitable about her will to perform, and insecurity has been part of her experience for decades, it's clear.	'Shoot Me' paints a loving but prickly and honest portrait of someone who's never been less than honest, if sometimes to a fault.	Irresistibly brash and deeply moving, "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me" is a vanity-free portrait of a phenomenal artist.	Follows the groundwork laid out by the recent Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work, alternating between look-where-she's-been historical footage and look-at-her-go glimpses of her current busy schedule.	Brutally honest and utterly compelling, Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me offers a riveting, vanity-free portrait of its legendary subject while offering a few essential truths about the human condition.
Cheap Thrills is little more than low-budget torture porn for the doobie-addled dudebro contingent.	E L Katz's film delivers exactly what the title promises. It is a very bloody, very violent fairground ride of a movie that ratchets up the tension as its two hapless anti-heroes compete desperately for money.	With a grindhouse title like Cheap Thrills, Cheap Thrills delivers the goods by exploiting its characters in fun and provocative ways.	A textbook case of a film that never quite amounts to the sum of its parts, Cheap Thrills is still more than its title suggests and provides dark entertainment for those in the mood.	Cheap Thrills is the sort of film that makes you want to applaud as soon as it ends ... a must for anyone with a penchant for the darker side of cinema.	Gleefully nasty and darkly hilarious, Cheap Thrills lives down to its title in the best possible way.
Explores the rawness of one teenage girl's feelings as she rides the roller-coaster ride of ups and downs in a mysterious and enthralling relationship.	Lacking in warmth but a promising example of young French talent in front of and behind the camera.	Some scenes could've been gratuitous were it not for the film's cold restraint, but the slow pace bottles a sense of that age when time seems to stretch endlessly.	First film by gifted scripter-helmer Celine Sciamma nails the aching doubts and offhanded cruelty of 15- and 16-year-old girls.	Water Lilies sees female adolescence as an uncomfortable, embarrassing phase full of painful self-consciousness and frustrated desire.	Water Lilies is a sharply-observed, provocative coming-of-age story that captures the anxieties of the early teen years.
While the film loses some urgency in its final third, it's a thrilling, shocking snapshot of a moment in time that will live in history, a reminder of the very real threat that those in power can pose to the citizens they have sworn to protect.	... the systematic mining of communications from people the government has no reason to suspect of terrorism is indeed a thing. And, thanks to Poitras, we are there at the moment it became impossibly naive to believe otherwise.	Poitras' stance is simply to present the evidence, without commentary, angle or narrative.	Filmmaker Laura Poitras paints a frankly terrifying picture of the loss of liberty involved in the widespread government gathering of the communication done by ordinary Joes on a daily basis.	"Citizenfour" is an urgent, gripping real-life spy story that should be seen by every American, and quite likely by everybody else too.	Part real-life thriller, part sobering examination of 21st century civil liberties, Citizenfour transcends ideology to offer riveting, must-see cinema.
Connery didn't want to play Bond anymore, and it shows in this forgettable picture.	...one that some connoisseurs consider a high point in the series and others think is a miss. I favor the latter view.	Although some may think it's a little too light, the action and soundtrack place this one near the top in the entire Bond series.	Blofeld's volcano hideout is one of the most impressive of Ken Adam's sets for the franchise, and it is a pleasure to watch it be completely destroyed.	The plot is the problem. It stretches the limits of credibility, even as that word is applied to Bond movies.	With exotic locales, impressive special effects, and a worthy central villain, You Only Live Twice overcomes a messy and implausible story to deliver another memorable early Bond flick.
Troubling and powerful.	Unfortunately Denis' detached and indifferent camera never gets inside the story, its characters, or its milieu.	An intelligent, moral shocker.	...salaciously simplistic.	Murderous Maids has a lot going for it, not least the brilliant performances by Testud ... and Parmentier.	A historical account that is equally disturbing and engrossing, with a powerful performance by Sylvie Testud.
An unexpected but fully welcome treat. It's a great look at how both relationships and the creative instinct evolve over a long time.	As a documentary and a love story, Cutie and the Boxer is nothing short of breathtaking. There's a nimbleness to the storytelling that always keeps you involved...It's not mushy but it is resonantly heartfelt.	It's a deeply affecting yet keen-eyed portrait of the struggles of art, love and life.	The takeaway from the bickering and paint splatter is that the couple's feisty commitment to one another is an art unto itself.	The couple are thriving, but, given what we learn about Alex, the up-beat ending jars.	A beautifully-made documentary that explores the challenges and richness of both marriage and art through the lens of a fascinating and complex couple.
Overrated, but still a good film.	Spielberg's classicism comes to be appreciated in a goosebumps-inducing send-off for Mister.	Inspiring, sentimental tale of survival.	A far better film than is usually thought.	Spielberg's first big drama is often hokey in places but ultimately succeeds.	A sentimental tale that reveals great emotional truths in American history.
A sturdy suspense story, set in Stasi-infected East Germany, rich in moral compromise, individual integrity and general desperation, it's elevated by Hoss to something sublime and unforgettable ...	Subtly intriguing and ambiguous, it's filled with suspicion and subterfuge.	A superby-crafted paranoia story ...	A quietly absorbing character study.	Tough and tender, it's the best Iron Curtain drama since The Lives Of Others.	Smart, solidly grafted, and thoroughly gripping, Barbara offers a deliberately paced, subtly powerful character study.
Given the potential richness and entertainment value of the subject matter, Hirsch's documentary engages more with the honorable nature of its subject matter than its execution. Pacing, length and an unfocussed narrative thread eventually wear the viewer	Like the songs themselves, "Amandla!" tells a terrible story in a most enthusiastic and upbeat way.	A beautiful movie about the power of music, about the power of being right.	The sound of liberation, set to the beat of human destiny.	Viewers will leave Amandla! moved by the music, impressed by the musicians and dubious about the possibility of political and social healing.	The powerful singing in Amandla makes for an uplifting, compelling documentary.
A Cat in Paris is thrilling, and a thrilling example of traditional ink and paint cartooning.	It's difficult to imagine the audience for this pretty but hollow film.	Serge Besset's jazzy score and some smart dialogue help things along, and the finale atop Notre Dame is quite something.	A charming little French animation (not suitable for very young children,) directed by Alain Gagnol and Jean-Loup Felicioli...	There are wild chases and fever dreams, and sometimes the thieving and the thieves become a muddle. But the animation of A Cat in Paris itself is so artful, it steals the day.	A Cat in Paris depicts a stylish, imaginative world with a wonderful soundtrack and Hitchcockian overtones.
Brosnan uses them well, slipping comfortably into the role of Bond. It's just unfortunate that his debut film couldn't have been more interesting.	The special effects in GoldenEye make every other Bond film seem almost primitive.	The exotic settings, fight scenes, and car chases are also good, and the supporting cast is admirable.	It is Bond's encounters with various villains and his romantic interest -- and all those wild stunts -- that fans pay to see. And they won't be disappointed.	...a solid, sporadically electrifying entry in this ongoing series.	The first and best Pierce Brosnan Bond film, GoldenEye brings the series into a more modern context, and the result is a 007 entry that's high-tech, action-packed, and urbane.
An intermittently gripping shocker.	The first 3-D feature in WarnerColor and with Warner-Phonic sound is a magnificently macabre thriller and far superior to the earlier 3-D efforts.	Campy, overrated remake of the 1933 classic, Mystery of the Wax Museum.	One of the great horror classics.	House of Wax is not particularly scary or suspenseful, but it is a lot of fun and effectively creates an atmosphere of dread using bright colors and shadows.	House of Wax is a 3-D horror delight that combines the atmospheric eerieness of the wax museum with the always chilling presence of Vincent Price.
Enjoyably trippy, brain-bending stuff, but the most satisfying thing about Moon is that it marks a return to the notion of science fiction as a genre fuelled by big ideas rather than big special effects.	A gripping, thoughtful, extremely claustrophobic movie.	A seriously impressive debut from British director Duncan Jones.	They do make 'em like they used to - a fresh blast of old-school sci-fi, bursting with ideas and a stellar turn from Rockwell.	Someday, Rockwell will get his Oscar due, I have no doubt. But I bet that when that day comes, lots of movie lovers will look back and say, 'But it should have happened for Moon.'	Boosted by Sam Rockwell's intense performance, Moon is a compelling work of science-fiction, and a promising debut from director Duncan Jones.
A very promising debut, but the quality of Stettner's writing and directing is topped only by a wonderful performance from Channing.	Leaves you with plenty to think about regarding the demands society places on working women, and the scorn they face when they choose career over family.	Powerful performances from Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles are saddled with a slow-developing story.	If The Business of Strangers clunks as a whole, at least several of its parts offer momentary pleasures.	Smart, subtle, and deliciously vindictive, this is taut theater with a current of nerve-wracking tension.	The Business of Strangers showcases a complex, compelling performance by Channing. Her interactions and clashes with Stiles make for riveting viewing.
Philomena is an amazing story, movingly told, which skirts sentimentality and rings true.	Based on a true story, this warm drama uses sharp humour to keep from tipping over into sloppy sentiment.	Despite the glum subject, Coogan and Dench raise plenty of smiles as the unlikeliest of couples.	Whenever things get too didactic, Coogan's solemn presence helps the picture regain its balance.	A howl of anti-clerical outrage wrapped in a tea cozy, "Philomena" applies amusing banter and a sheen of good taste to the real-life quest of Philomena Lee.	Based on a powerful true story and led by note-perfect performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena offers a profoundly affecting drama for adult filmgoers of all ages.
The plot may be a little too cluttered for the toddler crowd to follow, but the next age group up should be amused, and the script by Peter Baynham and Sarah Smith has plenty of sly jokes for grown-ups.	A smart script - that sees kids asking why they can't find Santa's North Pole home on Google Earth - wrapped up in some nifty 3D visuals make this a highly enjoyable early Christmas present.	The surprise gift of the season: a sharp, savvy holiday comedy that doesn't get its laughs at the expense of those who start to glow in the early days of December. It's a most entertaining package indeed.	This witty, handsomely appointed 3-D animated feature is the most delightful Santa biopic since Edmund Gwenn donned the fat suit.	Both Nighy and Broadbent do wonderful, richly funny voice work.	Aardman Animations broadens their humor a bit for Arthur Christmas, a clever and earnest holiday film with surprising emotional strength.
Better and rawer than any of the remakes.	...gives us a glance of Reynolds when he still had potential, before he totally gave himself over to grin and giggle junk.	That The Longest Yard is considered something of a classic is baffling...	The original has just the right mix of toughness and humor. Burt Reynolds was born to play incarcerated quarterback Paul Crewe.	One of Reynold's best roles and an agreeable comedy.	Equal parts tough and funny, and led by a perfectly cast Burt Reynolds, The Longest Yard has an interesting political subtext and an excellent climax -- even if it takes too long to get there.
A film which tackles serious issues that are both intensely personal and widely political, but which fails to offer understanding of subjects which are perhaps simply incomprehensible.	Belgian director Joachim Lafosse paints an image of how domestic bliss turned untenable builds to a crime unforgivable in Our Children.	The audience is held in a vise of claustrophobia, and every room seems full of tiny, screaming children.	It's a quiet, immaculately acted study of appalling cruelty committed unconsciously by those who believe they're acting in the best interest of others.	It's a near-perfect portrait of a domestic tragedy as a master-and-servant psychodrama, one that leaves catastrophic collateral damage in its wake.	A wrenching, quietly violent psychodrama, Our Children has the courage to ask difficult questions, and the strength to leave the answers to the viewer.
even a toddler found it too uninteresting to stick around	The film will keep children amused without proving too much of an ordeal for grown-ups.	Pooh's Heffalump Movie is just the thing for really little kids and their parents.	Newcomer Kyle Stanger, who was just five when the movie was made, gives Lumpy so much personality and charm that every child will want a heffalump playmate of of his own.	Pooh's Heffalump Movie is a simple, innocent winner with amazing vocal talent, entertaining music and an important lesson for kids.	A charming and delightful walk through the Hundred Acres Woods for young viewers.
Ralph may be more a sinner than a saint, and his movie may be a little cheesy, but who cares - I thoroughly enjoyed following him on his quest.	A fine, small movie that deserves a long run.	For the jaded moviegoer, here's a little film that just might restore your faith -- in movies and a whole lot more.	Saint Ralph has all the elements of a sapfest waiting to happen, but it never does, instead delivering its heart with solid doses of harshness and humor	Written with the glee of a scheming Catholic schoolboy, but its geniality outstrips its plausibility.	Saint Ralph is an amiable tear-jerker that walks a fine line between being inspirational and being hokum.
There are plenty of unforgettable moments, such as that sublime crane shot over the new settlement of Flagstone, accompanied by Ennio Morricone's achingly romantic music.	Has the best title sequence ever shot	Leone's insistence on style trumped the need for substance.	The movie stretches on for nearly three hours, with intermission, and provides two false alarms before it finally ends.	Heroes, villains, desperados, and the inevitable shoot-outs: You'll find them all in what a lot of fans consider Leone's best film.	A landmark Sergio Leone spaghetti western masterpiece featuring a classic Morricone score.
It is, perhaps, the ultimate proof that a ridiculous movie and a good movie aren't mutually exclusive.	Start your engines.	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.	Superior set pieces continue to sustain this most dumbly enjoyable of franchises ...	"Furious 7" is the biggest, silliest movie in the "Fast and Furious" franchise, officially transforming the series into "The Avengers" with muscle cars. But what's wrong with big and silly?	Serving up a fresh round of over-the-top thrills while adding unexpected dramatic heft, Furious 7 keeps the franchise moving in more ways than one.
Hopkins and director Roger Donaldson can't wholly reinvent the feel-good wheel, but check out all the neat stuff on the spokes.	If you're looking for a solidly built, well-paced entertainment that puts a grin on your face, World's Fastest more than adequately fits the bill.	Without apology, Munro's story has been embellished and romanticized right to the edge of cornball, where it manages to make a hairpin turn and restore its balance.	Munro's vision, passion, and tenacity are matched by writer/director Roger Donaldson.	Anthony Hopkins is so endearing in this film that you can't help being charmed by his character and the story, even if you don't care about land speed records.	Overcomes its formulaic storyline thanks to Anthony Hopkins' warm and endearing portrayal of an age-defying thrill seeker.
The wrenching result is impossible to shake.	Fascinating and engrossing character study with strong performances from the cast...	Worth watching, even if it never transcends its self-imposed limitations.	Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman give the most psychologically acute performances of their film careers.	When the director's showboating isn't getting in the way, Belber's script lands some salient points about situational ethics and the pliable nature of guilt.	Taking place in a hotel room, Tape has the feel of a play, but its engrossing psychodrama allows its stars to shine.
"Hulk" is going to be big (pun intended) and I like it better than "Spiderman."	flails away at building the story	'When I lose control, I like it,' Bruce Banner confesses. Considering the film's military context, it's an expression of the public's own collective excitement when the U.S. 'Hulks out' at an undermatched foe...	Hulk, quite simply, smash.	Director Ang Lee is to be commended for at least at-tempting to go beyond what could have been an empty special effects bonanza. But the subject of strained child/parent relationships is treated superficially.	While Ang Lee's ambitious film earns marks for style and an attempt at dramatic depth, there's ultimately too much talking and not enough smashing.
Even half a century down the line, this movie remains a masterpiece of its genre.	MGM's full color, 'Scope production looks amazing, and Robby the Robot steals the show.	Even on technical levels, Forbidden Planet is a successful film. Special effects were best of its age, and even today some of the scenes might impress the viewers.	An all-time favorite; great soundtrack, wonderful "Monster from the Id" and a fetching Anne Francis.	An engaging 1956 science fiction gloss of Shakespeare's Tempest.	Shakespeare gets the deluxe space treatment in Forbidden Planet, an adaptation of The Tempest with impressive sets and seamless special effects.
Exudes the kind of warmth and intelligence that delivers to well-defined segments of the indie-oriented audience.	[Saving Face] gets its heart pumping by putting its lovers smack in the middle of family and community.	Saving Face's saving graces are its sense of humor and its strong cast.	A hugely charismatic performance from a glowing Joan Chen makes this cliched little comedy seem a whole lot fresher than it really is.	The message here, as in every quirky ethnic romantic comedy, is 'follow your heart.' But wouldn't it be great if for once the characters cared more about the continuity of antiquated cultural traditions than their own personal happiness?	A charming tale of a love affair that overcomes cultural taboos.
In the absence of any larger drama of characters or exploration of moral issues, the horror seems manipulative rather than dramatically justified.	Its moral and political viewpoint is so crushingly simple-minded that one yearns for the intellectual nuance of George Bush.	If it were better done, Tears would be offensive: the villains are evil, faceless, baby-murdering Muslims. But the movie is so shoddy and one-dimensional that it's just a dreary, predictably violent bore.	On hésite ŕ qualifier de film d'action cette pub évidente pour l'implication militaire américaine un peu partout dans le monde.	To his credit, director Antoine Fuqua makes this nonsense as effective as possible. In the end, however, his efforts are undone by the button-pushing script.	Tries to be high-minded, but in the end, it's just a stylish action movie.
The jazz is certainly here, but the passion is missing.	The movie has ample delights.	Pleasant enough but not exactly compelling.	Sweet and Lowdown is sensitive, funny, melodious, and utterly charming.	I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, but this is a good one.	Critics praise Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown for its charming, light-hearted comedy and quality acting.
What starts as a satire of the methodical, modernity-seeking society in Sweden ends as a heartwarming dramatic comedy in Norway.	It never patronises its characters in the quest for cheap laughs, treating them instead with commendable compassion.	Kitchen Stories will make you laugh and make you cry.	Almost perfect, a film about loneliness that makes you feel less alone.	It is a modest meditation on human nature that lingers, sweetly, in memory.	By turns touching and funny, this Norwegian import offers quietly absorbing commentary on modern life and friendship.
Em meio a tanta aзгo, Jackson consegue criar uma histуria de amor verossнmil entre um gorila de 8 metros e uma frбgil loira. Nгo dб pra exigir mais do que isso, nгo й mesmo?	I watched the last hour of the film with a knot in my stomach, the result of a combination of the love story and the brilliant special effects.	In the end, an homage is all this is. But given the size, scope and volume herein, that's plenty. It's all about Kong, and this movie goes ape delivering him.	A nearly seamless blend of cutting edge technology with much of the original's sensibility - Jackson's giant ape may be a special effect, but he is also a real character.	.	Featuring state-of-the-art special effects, terrific performances, and a majestic sense of spectacle, Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong is a potent epic that's faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original.
An excruciatingly dull rehash.	There's something positively mind-numbing about the relentless predictability of Sweet Home Alabama.	Sweet Home Alabama isn't going to win any Academy Awards, but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts.	If you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in, Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy's stand-up act.	Excruciatingly ordinary and unimaginative, and excruciatingly slow about spinning out its paltry little story.	Reese Witherspoon is charming enough, but the road to Alabama is well-traveled.
The granddaddy of a whole genre of action films still remains sharp, tough, and exciting.	... Not only the best action movie ever made but one of the very best of any genre.	Great escapist action, but it's still nothing more than an action movie %u2013 cinema's version of a nice, tasty hamburger.	Willis gleefully strips down the action movie to a pretend game for children who like to fire guns and shoot bad guys. Machismo may never be the same.	Oh, man! Is this a classic or what!	Its many imitators (and sequels) have never come close to matching the taut thrills of the definitive holiday action classic.
An unappealing comedy about uninteresting people in the music business.	"Get Him to the Greek" has all the earmarks of a Judd Apatow spin-off, and that's a good thing.	Diddy's scene-stealing work proves that he should really take a break from trying to prove his Serious Acting Chops and do more comedy.	Boundless, raunchy energy defines this intermittently funny comedy, which is well acted and unpretentious; the idea of watching a film with normal running time and without CGI effects is refreshing.	There are a lot of illegal drugs in Get Him to the Greek, and the movie itself sort of works like one. It's tempting, mood-altering and the laughs are addictive.	Thanks to a suitably raunchy script and a pair of winning performances from Jonah Hill and Russell Brand, Get Him to the Greek is one of the year's funniest comedies.
This tidy and fascinating documentary follows the plight of two young African refugees transplanted to the U.S. to make a better life.	Offers an opportunity to see a good movie and learn something about an issue that has received far too little attention in the U.S. press.	A powerful experience, both for the specific hardships of these boys and for the universality of their experience.	Lacking that exotic 'foreign' focus and by failing to address the hardships of their early lives, we're left with a routine film about teenagers making mistakes or growing up too fast.	Both uplifting and troubling.	The Lost boys of Sudan works as both a riveting documentary and scathing indictment of colonialism.
Even by the low standards of the horror subgenre playfully nicknamed "torture porn," P2 is scraping the bottom of the movie barrel.	The movie never gets out of the basement either.	It's lurid and overblown, relying on its lionhearted heroine never to play her most obvious escape card, but for those with a taste for such silliness, it makes for a harrowing night at the movies.	At least P2 has a little bit of psychological thrill to it.	Has quite a bit going for it, which makes its eventual reliance on inane genre gimmicks that much more disappointing.	P2 is full of gore, but low on suspense, featuring a cat-and-mouse plot has been done many times before.
If you enjoyed McDonagh's sharp dialogue and Gleeson's world-weary charm last time around, there's more than enough of both to keep you interested. But you might find the change of tone a bit disconcerting	Gleeson's beautiful acting deserves a better movie.	Intense and compassionate, it revolves around the complicated concept of forgiveness.	In its steady assemblage of details over an incidental, episodic structure it accrues a building sense of moral gravity.	Father James' stature grows in our eyes, due in great part to Gleeson's powerful performance, which at the very least deserves an Oscar nomination if not the award itself.	Led by a brilliant performance from Brendan Gleeson, Calvary tackles weighty issues with humor, intelligence, and sensitivity.
Ours not to reason why with "Goldfinger"; ours but to gape and admire; which is very easy and enjoyable until the story's iceberg of extravagance finally appears in its true proportions.	Goldfinger is sometimes very enjoyable, but it's too uneven for me to call it a masterpiece.	The one that all other Bond films must live up to, and the only one of the films that surpasses the book upon which it is based.	Goldfinger remains the gold standard for the Bond movies. Recent entries can't compare to this lustrous thriller, a throwback to when the term "thriller" had meaning.	The best Bond gets the best treatment.	Goldfinger is where James Bond as we know him comes into focus - it features one of 007's most famous lines ("A martini. Shaken, not stirred") and a wide range of gadgets that would become the series' trademark.
A thoughtful, compassionate portrait of characters trapped in appalling interior circumstances.	Raises the bar on the coming-of-age story with a tightly focused portrait of a 15-year-old who looks for a father figure and finds his kindly neighborhood sexual predator.	A boldly imaginative yet subtle exploration of male sexuality.	I kept wondering why I was watching these people, and an answer was never forthcoming.	A disturbing and provocative study of adolescence and isolation.	L.I.E. is a well-acted and unsettling look at a boy's relationship with a pedophile.
Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz, never better.	Beauty, obsession and longing are the central themes of this hypnotic but ultimately flawed drama in which Ben Kingsley's ageing college professor falls in lust with Penelope Cruz' stunning and vulnerable student.	A slow, uninteresting depiction of a selfish fool who possibly too-late realizes that he's grown old before he's actually grown up.	Director Isabel Coixet (My Life Without Me) keeps the focus on Kepesh, played by Kingsley in a performance that brings sympathy and humanity to a selfish, imperious, predatory man.	Elegy is a gorgeously shot, classy drama with a terrific supporting cast, but Kingsley's curiously hollow performance means it doesn't quite deliver the required emotional punch.	An intelligent, adult, and provocative Philip Roth adaptation that features classy performances, Elegy is never quite the sum of its parts.
The trouble is that the film's look trumps all.	The stuff that works in Beowulf really works, and the interaction between the human characters and the effects is so intricate that, flaws notwithstanding, I'm convinced this movie could have been made no other way.	If you want to understand what the pressure of Hollywood does to talent, if you want to experience where the movie business is heading in a big way, this benighted but likely remunerative film is the place to start.	A visually rousing epic and a surprisingly effective reworking of a classic.	As envisioned by director Robert Zemeckis, Beowulf is a sight to behold: The landscape and visuals are powerfully sweeping, the action sequences exhilarating and kinetic.	Featuring groundbreaking animation, stunning visuals, and a talented cast, Beowulf has in spades what more faithful book adaptations forget to bring: pure cinematic entertainment.
It's one of the fullest biographies ever made.	This is a fascinating, lusciously detailed portrait of an artist, but it could have used a little less colour and a bit more subtle shading.	One of the finest films about an artist ever made, fashioned by a filmmaker who's a notable artist himself.	To hold audience interest for 150 minutes with virtually no action sequences speaks volumes.	The director's best film since 1999's Topsy-Turvy.	Led by a masterful performance from Timothy Spall and brilliantly directed by Mike Leigh, Mr. Turner is a superior Hollywood biopic.
Eminently forgettable.	Loud, frantic, ridiculously overproduced and featuring a preening performance by Val Kilmer as a supposedly brilliant master of disguise, The Saint is sheer overkill.	Reinvention in the hands of Hollywood is seldom cause for celebration.	One of the most ludicrous scripts to come out of the Hollywood Script Factory in recent years.	Nothing in the film really makes any sense, and all the other characters seem buffoonish and arch, overplayed to the point of farce, more Matt Helm than James Bond.	The Saint is watchable thanks to Kilmer and Shue, but the muddled screenplay stretches credulity.
[Parents] may be peering at their watches and sympathizing with the Digimon who wails, 'What do we have to do to stop this fighting?'	If you love Digimon, here's more. No surprises.	The film is strictly for the kiddies, there's not that many grownups who would stand for monsters going at each other yelling Fart POWER!!!!! or whatever it is they're saying.	If there is any taste left in the world, the buck may very well stop here.	Overly violent swill.	Digimon is better than Pokemon, but it's still a predictable movie with mediocre animation.
Brings to vivid life the tribulations and even the joys of normal people whose loyalties are tested in abnormal times.	An important film, one that raises questions about the choices we make when our very humanity is at stake.	Hrebejk furthers his country's reputation for cinematic absurdity as the only sane artistic reaction to political insanity.	The performances ... pull us into the humanity and indignity of it all.	While Hrebejk's biblical references and baby making slapstick become somewhat labored, his gentle comedy nonetheless stands true to his title.	Divided We Fall takes a complex look at World War II, skillfully balancing humor and gravity.
Intense and enthralling...director Danny Boyle has crafted a different breed of summer thriller that delivers on all levels.	But what this spectacular-looking sci-fi thriller lacks in originality it makes up for in pure beauty: It just might be the most visually audacious and startlingly beautiful space opera since the original Solaris.	This is Sci-fi at its proudest; an incredible achievement that reminds us why Danny Boyle is the best British director working today.	Sunshine quickly fades from near-brilliance to dim potboiler.	Who cares? The characters are so sketchily drawn that it's hard to keep them straight, let alone get worked up about their survival.	Danny Boyle continues his descent into mind-twisting sci-fi madness, taking us along for the ride. Sunshine fulfills the dual requisite necessary to become classic sci-fi: dazzling visuals with intelligent action.
A tantalisingly explosive film about inner conflicts and secrets... a sublime psychological thriller in a western setting.	If anything, you walk out of the theatre feeling uneasy about the violent thrillers you may have enjoyed in the past.	A masterful symphony of contradiction.	What Mortensen does brilliantly is to keep us guessing.	Packed inside David Cronenberg's latest film, which presents itself as gift-wrapped, shoot-'em-up entertainment, is a sobering reflection on our culture's attitude toward violence.	A History of Violence raises compelling and thoughtful questions about the nature of violence, while representing a return to form for director David Cronenberg in one of his more uncharacteristic pieces.
It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good, but it is.	This is a lavish production that will remain a favourite for years to come.	A great big Bollywood musical, complete with song and dance and doomed love triangles and elegantly photographed men playing cricket. And it's terrific fun, in a way that only great big musical fantasies can be.	Lives up to its huge hype with a spirited and well crafted story that could become actor-cum-producer Aamir Khan's magnum opus.	A lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn.	Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals.
The continuing adventures of the world's scrawniest heroes.	...every single thing I disliked about The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was fixed in Prince Caspian.	Too many fights, not enough magic.	Stands a good chance of becoming the "Empire Strikes Back" of the "Narnia" series: a darker and more satisfying follow-up to an already exceptional starting point.	That rare sequel which improves upon the original.	The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is an entertaining family adventure worthy of the standard set by its predecessor.
Only any good when people are dancing.	Why quibble? Anyone who goes to this movie for the plot is insane. It's all about the moves and the bodies putting them on.	Step Up 2 has only a few points of correlation with its predecessor. It's also probably the single most racist movie that will be released by any major American studio in the first 10 years of the twenty-first century.	With a script cut-and-pasted from every other dance movie, this film is shockingly corny.	A dance romance with attitude that will fall short if you're expecting fulfillment in the story department.	There's a kinetic appeal to the handsome cast and their smooth moves, but everything else about Step Up 2 the Streets is been there, danced that.
lavishly entertaining epic	Lighthearted, pretty, and entertaining	This is the worst film to win the Best Picture Oscar.	Everything about this big, beautiful movie smacks of authenticity, excitement, and massive showmanship.	An amusing trip around the world in a style befitting Jules Verne, Around the World in 80 Days lives up to its hype as a massive, glossy epic.	It's undeniably shallow, but its cheerful lack of pretense -- as well as its grand scale and star-stuffed cast -- help make Around the World in 80 Days charmingly light-hearted entertainment.
This futuristic comedy depends on your opinion of Stallone and his unapologetic popcorn-pleasing action no-brainers. To be fair, this one is one of his better ones.	Not a bad mid-90s sci fi flick - and with a young Sandra Bullock in spandex to boot!	Let me say, the view of Utopia is nice and all, but it's not nearly negative enough.	Featuring intense action, exceptional special effects, and a healthy sense of humor, it is the film Last Action Hero wanted--and failed--to be.	...a sporadically amusing yet pervasively underwhelming bit of early '90s cheese...	A better-than-average sci-fi shoot-em-up with a satirical undercurrent, Demolition Man is bolstered by strong performances by Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, and Sandra Bullock.
John Cusack proved his quirky leading man charm here. Ione Skye is sublime.	"...A post-John Hughes innovator as a teen flick that ducks both Afterschool Special-isms and crass humour..."	Cameron Crowe crafts one of his best films around the end-of-high-school ennui and the uncertainties that come with that time in your life, but Say Anything... is aging faster than you might think, despite its many classic lines and moments.	Smart, well-developed characters, believable situations, and a solid emotional investment for us in the film's people and circumstances	You know that feeling when you're watching a movie for the first time, and it grabs you right away and it gets better and better until the very end? This is one of these very special films.	One of the definitive Generation X movies, Say Anything is equally funny and heartfelt -- and it established John Cusack as an icon for left-of-center types everywhere.
It`s hard to summon much wonder when Superman goes mano-a-mano with Nuclear Man, a Lex Luthor creation with a static electricity problem.	Even at 91 minutes, the film seems truncated.	Great cast, terrible premise, done ultra-cheap. Sad Supes had to go out like this.	The impoverishment here is not merely of means, but of spirit.	One of the cheesiest movies ever made.	The Superman series bottoms out here: the action is boring, the special effects look cheaper, and none of the actors appear interested in where the plot's going.
Plays like desperate repackagings of the first movie's more successful set pieces -- with the accent on desperate and the freshness level down to zero.	Lacks the fresh charm that made their first such an unexpected (if guilty) pleasure.	The jokes all revolve around weed, stereotypes, and Neil Patrick Harris; the stereotype stuff is by far the funniest.	A bag of shoddy skits that barely qualifies as a movie and taints pleasant memories of their previous clowning besides	Every aspect of the production is atrocious in the extreme.The writing is awful. The direction is bilious.	It may not equal its predecessor, but Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is still good for some laughs -- and food for thought.
Goes for shock over substance.	The Orphanage gets it exactly right; it builds suspense by sending out a disquieting vibe, then letting it slowly permeate your psyche before paying it off. This is one of the best ghost story films I've ever seen.	Superb. Even the cliche spooky kids are handled with aplomb.	The less you know of this film, the more you'll be surprised, shocked and, in the end, satisfied.	Eerie, atmospheric...an unexpectedly poignant ghost story.	Deeply unnerving and surprisingly poignant, The Orphanage is an atmospheric, beautifully crafted haunted house horror film that earns scares with a minimum of blood.
Un guión inteligente y honesto muestra como ambos lados del universo humano son totalmente diferentes entre sí, complementarios y sumamente complejos	Though it isn't quite Oscar material, Mel Gibson gives what may be the most entertaining big-star performance of its year.	English's attempts to fit The Women into a modern setting are intelligent, but that, unfortunately, does not suffice, because the film is so limp in so many other ways.	Mel Gibson is at his loosest and most playful for much of What Women Want.	It introduces us to a kinder, gentler Mel who's not only in touch with his feminine side, but who also widens his fan base considerably in the bargain.	Even though Gibson is a good sport in his role, What Women Want is a rather conventional, fluffy comedy-romance that doesn't make good use of its premise.
A film with texture, humour and relevance at all times. All in 91 minutes.	Outstanding Henry Fonda jury classic.	taut, well-crafted sociological study	Not much action, lots of words, great cinema.	Every bit the classic it's been made out to be for all these years.	Sidney Lumet's feature debut is a superbly written, dramatically effective courtroom thriller that rightfully stands as a modern classic.
Gambling tales are a hard sell. But this one is on a lucky streak. Great performances from Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn.	Winds up being that rare beast: the buddy comedy where you're not tired of the buddies well before the credits roll.	Mississippi Grind is a filmed series of lies, bad choices, and shaky attempts to get paid, all told through the texture, the soundtrack choices, and interesting casting.	Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have made a delightfully simple film that is now a rare American entertainment: a slow character piece driven by strong writing and good performances.	Mississippi Grind captures the ecstasy of a good role of the dice and the desperation of a bad turn of the cards -- and provides a sense of why some keep going even when it becomes clear they've lost their shot at a happy ending.	Well-acted and steeped in Southern atmosphere, Mississippi Grind is a road movie and addiction drama that transcends each of its well-worn genres.
The result in Meet the Spartans is less classic Mel Brooks than middling Best Week Ever.	I'm moving to Europe.	Besides the few chuckles I had, the movie was just dreadfully bad.	Don't expect anything of depth and you won't be disappointed by this predigested pabulum.	Clocking in around 69 minutes total, Meet the Spartans is not a movie. All involved should feel slightly ashamed.	A tired, unfunny, offensive waste of time, Meet the Spartans scrapes the bottom of the cinematic barrel.
'Nights in Rodanthe' serves up too much manipulated sentimentality for my taste, even though I admit being incurably romantic most of the time.	A singularly unsuccessful look at mature love.	Rodanthe is a reliably steamy stormy sultry story about Inner Change at the Outer Banks where strangers become intimates.	Okay, look: everybody has got to stop crying.	A tad clunky and sappy and yes, even hokey. But, the picture still works. I was always engaged, I was always interested in what happened next, and I was always entertained.	Derivative and schmaltzy, Nicholas Sparks' Nights in Rodanthe is strongly mottled by contrivances that even the charisma of stars Diane Lane and Richard Gere can't repair.
While its re-creation of combat is not Courage Under Fire's most involving aspect, the film succeeds in making the Gulf War seem more of a real event than all the footage shipped back on CNN could.	It is the kind of film which satisfies even as it leaves you suspecting that the scope should have been narrowed.	Bold and visionary movie that dare to make the pursuit of truth into a spiritual quest.	Denzel Washington reinforces his image as a serious leading man who dominates a film with his quiet intensity and aura of introspection.	A fascinating mystery mixed with war action.	An emotional and intriguing tale of a military officer who must review the merits of a fallen officer while confronting his own war demons. Effectively depicts the terrors of war as well as its heartbreaking aftermath.
There's nothing fresh in Sandler's role that you haven't seen in almost every movie he's ever done -- the same mumbly, underachiever-schlub notes he's been hitting for years, only taken down a notch for his first PG-rated comedy.	It's a delightfully innocent movie that the actor can actually show to his two baby daughters without blushing.	The twitchy anxiety that once powered his persona has given way to a doughy anonymity.	If you are forced to attend, then at least Bedtime Stories is tolerable, and occasionally fun -- when it forgets to be dumb.	It's a little odd that making a film for children has almost made Adam Sandler grow up.	Though it may earns some chuckles from pre-teens, this kid-friendly Adam Sandler comedy is uneven, poorly paced, and lacks the requisite whimsy to truly work.
A cerebral and suspenseful film of foreboding atmosphere. On a short list of truly outstanding remakes.	[Philip] Kaufman's version persuasively asserts its right to life as an imaginative reflection of our time...	utterly chilling	...what if the mask of your neighbor tilts for a second and you catch a glimpse of the riot going on behind his face?	one of the great sci-fi horrorshows, a movie that gooses you with its premise, makes you laugh and jump, and ultimately leaves you with something you can't quite shake	Employing gritty camerawork and evocative sound effects, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a powerful remake that expands upon themes and ideas only lightly explored in the original.
McG, a music video maven whose previous credits include the Charlie's Angels movies, directs the action passably well.	With much buzzing, beeping and whirring, the Terminator franchise comes to an absolute creative standstill, or even goes clankingly into reverse, with this fantastically dull fourth episode.	Listen, come over to my place this weekend; we'll rewatch Terminator 1 and 2, we'll listen to 'You Could Be Mine' by Guns N Roses, we can even discuss Edward Furlong's 'career'. And let's just pretend Terminator Salvation never happened.	The trouble with Terminator: Salvation ... [is that] there's a yawning void where its emotional center should be.	It's a catastrophically bad movie whose aggressive dullness and dumbness can best be reproduced by picking up a brick and slamming it against one's forehead for two hours.	With storytelling as robotic as the film's iconic villains, Terminator Salvation offers plenty of great effects but lacks the heart of the original films.
Skeptics and scoffers will find "Hereafter" the funniest film of the year. Others, however, might simply yawn at its pretentious cravings, funereal pace, and murky intentions.	It thoughtfully reflects on how deep sorrow and melancholy can change existence, with both Damon and de France really making their performances count.	In the film's far-reaching goals, "Hereafter" fails to connect its meticulous plotting together, leaving the second hour unnecessarily tedious and overtly detached from the audience.	Hereafter doesn't feel like a Clint Eastwood film; it's more like a very special edition of John Edward's psychic TV show.	...an honest attempt to explore the single greatest mystery of life...with intelligence, open-mindedness, understanding, and compassion.	Despite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood's typical flair as director, Hereafter fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium.
Chinese-Canadian director Lixin Fan presents the human cost of China's economic rise in terms any parent or child can understand.	It's vivid and revealing, but it's also tough to watch.	As in the recent Sweetgrass and Alamar, Fan constructs a narrative from carefully observed reality that discerns individual pathos within the sweep of history.	Helmed by Fan Lixin, who also takes credits as d.p. and co-editor, the pic laudably adopts an intimate, personal approach to a subject -- hardworking Chinese garment workers -- that's been covered in more hectoring fashion elsewhere.	It's a fascinating, heartbreaking attempt to capture the overwhelming hugeness, and harsh growing pains of China's exploding economy, by focusing on one family.	Last Train Home is a haunting, vivid documentary exploring the human toll of China's economic boom in intimate, unforgettable detail.
The gotcha journalism backfires; instead of looking like a crew of crusading reporters unmasking the powerful, it just looks like a couple of practical jokers invading people's privacy.	Um protesto importante e ocasionalmente revelador, mas que se enfraquece por nгo oferecer alternativas viбveis ao sistema de classificaзгo da MPAA e pela auto-inclusгo desnecessбria do diretor na discussгo.	Might I suggest a new ratings category for the MPAA: NP-21 (non-parents over the age of 21 might want to skip this one altogether).	Kirby Dick's indispensable guerrilla attack on the film-ratings system.	Raises some probing questions about the secrecy of ratings decisions in a way that entertains and educates audiences with or without agendas to protect film integrity.	A fascinating and entertaining film that will open many eyes to the often-questioned tactics of the MPAA and their ratings sytem.
The power Sir! No Sir! has as a film overrides any problems it presents.	In his smart, timely documentary, David Zeiger remembers that war and the veterans whose struggles against it are too often forgotten.	A powerful documentary that uncovers half-forgotten history, history that is still relevant but not in ways you might be expecting.	Zeiger makes good use of archival footage, photos and sound bites from the period. And the frankness of his interview subjects is refreshing.	Not only a fascinating illumination of a blotted-out part of the counter-cultural, popular-protest '60s, but a timely questioning of patriotism and duty in the midst of an increasingly unjustifiable war.	A powerful reflection on a pivotal era, from a viewpoint seldom visited, this documentary hits home, especially with its relevance to current events.
The film's extended suspense sequences deserve a place among the great stretches of cinema.	Excellent, but nasty stuff.	A perfect blend of suspense and social satire.	Now seems much less like Salt of the Earth-as-a-potboiler and a lot more like the spiritual godfather to every testosterone-fuelled thrill ride since.	A significant influence on Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, this grueling pile driver of a movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.	An existential suspense classic, The Wages of Fear blends nonstop suspense with biting satire; its influence is still being felt on today's thrillers.
Here's a 3-D movie that should have been shot in Zero-D.	The Green Hornet doesn't seem worth the outrageous 3-D-glasses surcharge. In all senses, there's little that jumps out at you.	You know, superhero comedy is tricky. They can't all be Blankman.	What happens when smart people set out to make a dumb movie. They made the movie they wanted to watch, rather than the one anyone else might want to.	Slick, sly and ever-soslightly subversive, The Green Hornet is an irreverent comedy bound to annoy comic-book purists - usually a good sign - and sure to delight everyone else. Think this year's Kick-Ass.	It's sporadically entertaining, but The Green Hornet never approaches the surreal heights suggested by a Michel Gondry/Seth Rogen collaboration.
You can probably guess the trajectory of the story. But it's not really the destination that makes this a charmer, it's the journey there, mostly by grocery van.	Director Eric Guirado has woven an endearing modern-day fable that offers a pleasant 90-minute respite from the worries to be found outside the theater doors.	A film that sticks close to its characters and plays fair with them throughout.	The plot of "The Grocer's Son" is familiar, but its impressionistic visual stylings are at once lyrical and precise, gestures toward character rather than pronouncements.	Ignore the boorish main character, and The Grocer's Son is salvageable as a celebration of rustic pleasures.	A noteworthy performance by Eric Guirado makes this gently pastoral film a moving coming-of-age story.
Working to a spare screenplay, Bahrani offers none of the usual clues about either the cabbie's surprising determination to prevent the tragedy or the old man's reasons for suicide. This doesn't always help the quiet drama.	Goodbye Solo feels lived-in rather than forced upon us. Bahrani, who is his own editor, and regular DP Michael Simmonds have a sad, solitary, streetlamp-lit feel for night-shift rhythms.	A film light in plot but generous in spirit.	One of those movies that I think will change as I get older, growing even more with time. If we're lucky, you can say that about a few films a year. It's nice to get one so early in 2009.	A quietly soulful study of two very different men.	An original and thoughtful human drama, Goodbye Solo looks at relationships and loneliness while proving director Ramin Bahrani's is an important American voice.
Painful, eye-opening, and extraordinarily necessary to view, especially by the young to whom the Holocaust is nowadays too abstract a notion to fully mentally envision in all of its grotesqueness	A Film Unfinished is a sort of ghost story. It's guaranteed to haunt you.	Hersonski brings something both old and new to the table with this powerful 89-minute documentary. Other strengths are the well-written narration read by Rona Keenan and the haunting original music of composer Yishai Adar.	That Hersonski's grandmother was a Warsaw Ghetto survivor gives her film a deeply personal edge. That she coolly and convincingly extracts truth from propaganda makes her truly revelatory A Film Unfinished all the more important and compelling.	For serious Holocaust junkies only.	A heartbreaking, haunting historical document, A Film Unfinished excavates particularly horrible chapter of Holocaust history, and in doing so, the film provides a glimpse into the Nazi propaganda machine.
Theron has the greater range, but you'll wish it had been applied to more worthwhile material.	With a convoluted, contrived plot that effectively emasculates and lobotomizes the lead characters, Sweet November fails to connect on an emotional level.	I kept waiting for [Reeves] to point out that, given the state of San Francisco real estate these days, it's hard to reconcile a life of endless surf-romping with a life of having a roof over one's head.	Charlize Theron has charm and skill, but no actress could survive this role, which has the gravity and verisimilitude of a sketch from a late-sixties Nancy Sinatra TV special.	What may be the worst performance yet by Keanu Reeves.	Schmaltzy and manipulative, Sweet November suffers from an implausible plot and non-existent chemistry between its leads.
A strange and funny film, smart, complex and difficult to shake.	Unfortunately, the groove it settles into is a lot less interesting than the possibilities suggested earlier.	A superb black comedy.	Suspenseful and delightfully creepy.	A witty, frightening, well-acted picture with near-perfect cinematic timing.	A darkly funny thriller that's reminiscent of Hitchcock.
Men may roll their eyes, and anyone under the age of 35 is likely to fall asleep, but for the target audience, this is a fantastic film.	It may have taken two decades for Hollywood to finally fall in love with Lane, but Under the Tuscan Sun proves it was better late than never.	Pleasant, light, tear-jerking entertainment	Wells acknowledges that in adapting Mayes' memoir she jettisoned anything uncinematic ... and nailed up a popsicle-stick frame of a story that can't support the weight of the movie's "love is just around the corner" theme.	The only real depth here is in Lane's ability to convey lingering heartache despite having little call to do so from the script.	Though formulaic and superficial, Under the Tuscan Sun is redeemed by Lane's vibrant performance.
This is voyeurism of a brilliant, deeply refined order. If the MPAA had a shot at rating Strickland's fantasy, they would try to condemn it without being able to explain why.	Nothing if not a mood piece, but amid its atmospherics and winking asides, it's also a fascinating portrait of a relationship.	At its core, this is one of the most incisive, penetrating, and empathetic films ever made about what it truly means to love another person, audaciously disguised as salacious midnight-movie fare.	Peter Strickland follows up his chilly giallo-horror Berberian Sound Studio with something altogether warmer and sweeter - though no less strange.	Sexy, funny, beguiling, and above all, humane, The Duke of Burgundy does for erotic euro-lesbian thrillers what Under the Skin did for sci-fi.	Stylish, sensual, and smart, The Duke of Burgundy proves that erotic cinema can have genuine substance.
One of a scant few true Fantasy masterpieces.	All in all, The Neverending Story is a silly fantasy movie that often shows its age, but as a kids' movie it still has enough exciting action and you-can-do-it attitude to earn itself a place in a family's DVD collection.	Only a certified grump could dislike this engaging fantasy that wends its way into the imagination and is a delight on most levels.	Classic fantasy, full of wonderful creatures and characters.	[A] marvelous, inventive, inspiring fantasy.	A magical journey about the power of a young boy's imagination to save a dying fantasy land, The NeverEnding Story remains a much-loved kids adventure.
...it tickles the funny bone often enough to merit serious consideration among lowbrow comedies.	A gross-out classic.	Given American cinema's current obsession with innocence and ignorance, at least this never romanticises its protagonists. They are genuinely, irredeemably, 100 per cent no-hopers.	Dumb & Dumber doesn't have the greatest of plots nor the most impressive direction there is, but it's hysterically funny, which is more than enough for me to recommend it heartily.	The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.	A relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors: Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.
Forget the dogs; who let this movie out?	It's all very cute, though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old.	It's playful, corny, silly, adventuresome and enjoyable.	Show me the mugging.	Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs, but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy.	A mediocre live-action children's movie, Snow Dogs is filled with cliched dialogue, tiresome pratfalls, and stale fish-out-of-water jokes.
Nothing much of any import or interest happens to get us to the end we predicted within the first two minutes, so if for some masochistic reason you do let your kid drag you to this, this would be a good time to catch a nap.	The press notes boast that the total production time was only 15 months, 'unheard of for a first-class computer animated movie.' Maybe there's a reason why that's unheard-of.	Happily N'Ever After is proof-positive that Europeans may have us beaten in soccer, wine and luxury cars, but they still can't make a decent 3-D cartoon.	Painfully devoid of charm, wit, and ingenuity, this interminable, tongue-in-cheek slough through Fairy Tale Land is so jaw-droppingly awful, the executors of the Brothers Grimm literary estate should consider taking legal action.	'I hate to tell you, but it gets worse,' one character promises midway through Happily N'Ever After. No kidding.	Happily N'Ever After has none of the moxy, edge, or postmodern wit of the other fairy-tales-gone-haywire CG movie it so blatantly rips off.
The speed with which a healthy, relatively young stud can morph into a tub of lard is as horrifying as it is entertaining to watch.	Super Size Me is essentially the perfect documentary...	I'm less certain that super smug Spurlock is a man with a mission than I am resolutely convinced that he's a man out to draw attention to himself.	Spurlock constructs the film brilliantly, maintaining a darkly hilarious tone while continually jolting us.	Spurlock's light touch keeps Super Size Me entertaining and educational, without sacrificing one for the other.	Entertaining doc about the adverse effects of eating fast food.
Absorbing, funny, exhilaratingly entertaining.	Puts you eye to human eye with struggling creatures neither fully god nor fully beast.	Serious, funny, frustrating and touching.	The most raw and real portrayal of how a rock group works...and how it sometimes doesn't.	A mostly terrific documentary about a mostly terrible album. Despite derisory poor-me whining, it captures fragility and fear in Metallica's questioned relevancy, considered disbandment and the closest things to tears they can muster for each other.	Fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how Metallica survives one of their more turbulent periods.
Quantum -- the 22d 'official' Bond picture, 24th including the rogue Bonds -- is never less than engaging.	A hyperactive James Bond whose attention-deficit antics ought to resonate with the restlessness of the Joystick Generation.	Rather than feeling lean and mean, the film just feels rushed and short, as if the filmmakers were simply shrugging, "that's it... that's all we've got right now."	I mean it as a cockeyed compliment to the reborn Bond franchise, then, when I say that Quantum of Solace is an unnecessarily cramped arena for such an interesting cat.	Hats off to Daniel Craig. Those attempting the next Hollywood video game adaptation would do well to take note.	Brutal and breathless, Quantum Of Solace delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action. Not as good as franchise reboot Casino Royale, but still an impressive entry to the Bond canon.
The film has no discernible rhythm, little in the way of wit, and the plot plays like Myers considered it an unpleasant obligation.	So sari, Mike Myers. Your spoof of "Bollywood" stinks.	Believe me, I'm as surprised as you are that I wound up sort of enjoying it.	It's a rare film that makes a reviewer consider giving up the movies altogether. My own Waterloo came forty-five minutes into The Love Guru when I briefly considered stabbing out my own eyes so that I wouldn't have to watch it any more.	For a comic genius, Mike Myers sure aims low.	The Love Guru features far too many gross-out gags, and too few earned laughs, ranking as one of Mike Myers' poorest outings.
Directors Martha Shane and Lana Wilson in this topical documentary ably tackle in a fair-minded and detailed way the controversial issue of third-trimester abortions.	After Tiller takes a compassionate look at a highly impassioned situation.	No matter which side of the abortion issue you're on, prepare to be emotionally devastated.	More than simply informative (which it most certainly is), After Tiller is a reminder that seeing eye-to-eye is rarely as impossible as we might think.	The movie takes a calm and intellectual approach to an inflammatory subject, elevating what could have easily come off as propaganda into a reasoned and thoughtful work of journalism.	After Tiller applies empathy, honesty, and graceful understatement to a discussion that all too often lacks them all.
Sentimental and surprisingly uncomplicated, Ladder 49 seems a disservice to the very folks it wants to extol.	There's a message in [this film]. Not only are firemen swell guys, they're swell HETEROSEXUAL guys.	An overly manufactured would-be tearjerking package that will surely give less savvy moviegoers the illusion that they've watched an Important and Meaningful Film.	A better name for "Ladder 49" would have been "Chutes and Ladders," like the game...	The problem with Ladder 49 is that it wants to be a tribute more than it wants to be a movie. It's mostly exposition; no true narrative exists.	Instead of humanizing the firemen, the movie idolizes them, and thus renders them into cardboard characters.
It seems that the filmmakers were so intent on getting the look and sound right that they forgot to put much effort into delivering an entertaining or even okay story.	Scooby-Doo could have been a total disaster, but winds up being some fun summer entertainment.	"Scooby Doo" is, God help us, a faithful adaptation of the wretched series.	Get out your pooper-scoopers.	Unless you're an AOL Time Warner board member, there's nothing to like about this insipid live-action version of the 1970s cartoon series.	Though Lillard is uncannily spot-on as Shaggy, Scooby Doo is a tired live-action update, filled with lame jokes.
Ephron has crafted a movie that is bursting with butter and sweets yet ends up completely bland.	Channeling Julia Child had to be a challenge for Meryl Streep, and I do not mean just getting that distinctive voice down. Streep not only nails the voice, but the body language as well. ...And amazingly, she embodies the great chef's spirit.	Julie & Julia is a heartfelt, deliciously shot, and beautifully designed romp, studded with fine performances that are endearingly cheery, inspirational and funny. It's a must-see for anyone who loves to eat.	What makes this film memorable and pleasurable, above all, is the ebullient performance of Meryl Streep as Julia Child, unlikely culinary trailblazer and TV star.	The joys of the Julia parts are cumulative, and addictive. The Julie parts keep forcing us to go cold turkey.	Boosted by Meryl Streep's charismatic performance as Julia Child, Julie and Julia is a light, but fairly entertaining culinary comedy.
[The film's] hauntingly slow rhythms underscore the immanent violence and impotent rage that cripple already attenuated lives.	Long, masterfully executed shots accompanied by minimal dialogue and a richly expressive soundtrack; subdued performances punctuated by violent bursts of emotion; and a confident trust in the combination of stark realism and unadorned melodrama.	This is a fascinating film that, once seen, is hard to dislodge from your imagination.	The pace is deliberate, sometimes slow, but the whirlpool pull of this tragic psychological thriller is irresistible.	Ceylan orchestrates all the elements of his film into a gripping experience of manipulation and retribution, with an ironic final twist.	Exploring the effects of a family's dealings with an underhanded politician, this crime drama avoids showing the violent outcomes of its characters' misdeeds, resulting in a lingeringly potent film.
Tony Manero, Vincent Vega, Charlie Wax. Travolta has his franchise now! Gleeful killer Wax makes Bond and Bourne look like clumsy amateurs. Roaring fun.	A strong plot and some super cool tough-guy dialogue makes this an entertaining and engaging film	an over-the-top mixture of bad-ass verbal bluster, two-dimensional villainy, martial arts mayhem, and absurd action setpieces	From Paris With Love is even more mindless than Taken and is more fun than the recent Edge of Darkness. But that still leaves it lagging far behind Morel's District B13.	From Paris With Indifference is more like it.	Thought not without its charms -- chief among them John Travolta's endearingly over-the-top performance -- From Paris with Love is too muddled and disjointed to satisfy.
A real eye opener; it offers a devastating critique of the present status of the war on drugs.	All in all, it's one of the best (though not the best) films of the year.	There's enough here to keep anyone in awe.	An Altmanesque multi-layered narrative that covers every aspect of the illegal drug trade between Mexico and the United States.	It should be mandatory viewing for absolutely everyone ... especially those involved in the war on drugs.	Soderbergh successfully pulls off the highly ambitious Traffic, a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around.
Regardless of the fact that The Aviator may not be Scorsese's best work, it is unquestionably a creative piece of moviemaking.	It's history and biography and, as Scorsese, Logan and Orson Welles before them affirm, a distinctly American story.	It's stylish and fleet, and even though it's meticulously detailed, Scorsese's devotion to technique never weighs it down.	This undoubtedly is the movie Scorsese set out to make, and he made it exceedingly well. Still, we can fault him for choosing to celebrate its subject instead of examining him.	This is a thrilling picture that merges [Scorsese's] gritty style and his adoration of old-fashioned Hollywood. The production design alone makes the film a must-see.	With a rich sense of period detail, The Aviator succeeds thanks to typically assured direction from Martin Scorsese and a strong performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who charts Howard Hughes' descent from eccentric billionaire to reclusive madman.
...a tight, focussed suspense film...forcefully direct and simple...	"13 Tzameti" has you on the edge of your seat with a story that throws unexpected punches at every corner.	Biting into the dubious apple of the new market economy.	13 Tzameti flaunts a grim sense of the absurd that suggests a French new wave film infected with a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism.	While Hostel reeked of xenophobia, 13 notes that often the boogeymen are in our own backyards, and that most are within a few paychecks of falling prey to them.	This starkly minimalist nail-biter of a thriller relentlessly builds up the tension and keeps the audience guessing.
A seamless comedy about a priggish, upper-crust beauty who finally gets her comeuppance and learns some tolerance.	Cukor's direction flawlessly picks up on defining character traits, and all the intricate detail makes watching this movie feel like you're an invisible gatecrasher at the Lords' party.	Screwball romance is lots of fun for older kids.	It has been a long time since Hollywood has spent itself so extravagantly, and to such entertaining effect, upon a straight upper-crust fable, an unblushing apologia for plutocracy.	The Philadelphia Story is a classic movie featuring three of the silver screen's greatest and most enduring stars.	Offering a wonderfully witty script, spotless direction from George Cukor, and typically excellent lead performances, The Philadelphia Story is an unqualified classic.
There can be little doubt that a whole new generation is about to discover the charm, wit and fun of Maverick.	This is a rollicking, Saturday afternoon adventure, the quintessential summer movie.	It may make the $100 million, but it is not a well-made film.	Mildly amusing - for about 35 seconds.	Somewhere about halfway through Hour Two, you might find yourself looking at your watch and wondering, 'Like, when is this movie going to begin?'	It isn't terribly deep, but it's witty and undeniably charming, and the cast is obviously having fun.
The interviews are fluid and snappy, and there's plenty of footage that encapsulates just how enraptured Jonestown was with Jim Jones' vision.	Jonestown is a somber and non-exploitive reconstruction of the events that led the members of the Peoples Temple.	Ultimately, the film doesn't entirely answer the massive 'why' at the center of this story -- that answer died on that day in 1978 -- but it's a haunting exploration of an event of unspeakable sadness, which still resonates decades later.	The film says just as much about the state of American politics, the emergence of a mass media and the perceived sanctity of religion as it does about one of the world's lesser-known demagogues.	It is a frightening epitaph for what is surely one of the 20th century's most heartbreaking cautionary tales against giving one up to the will of another.	Director Stanley Nelson avoids editorializing and sensationalizing in Jonestown, letting the CIA photos and film speak for themselves, and giving a voice to the surviving victims.
Funny, even perceptive, adult/family comedy.	Here is a comedy that treats the problems and delights of real life with respect, insight, warmth and remarkably sustained wit.	The performances are all wonderful, each actor having received some sort of acting plum and each giving it his all. Director Ron Howard is very good at comedy, and his timing is expert throughout the film.	Always makes me cry- touching and funny	Parenthood is so nice and so fun that you just want to put aside concerns about its manipulation and its sanitized version of kids' struggles. If you can do that, then this feel-good effort will work for you.	Bolstered by a delightful cast, Parenthood is a funny and thoughtfully crafted look at the best and worst moments of family life that resonates broadly.
The comic relief never wears out the dramatic relief, and vice versa. It is low. Come for the sheep whizzing in MacFarlane's face-we're even now for "We Saw Your Boobs." Stay to see Theron handling a battering husband rather aesthetically.	A Million Ways to Die in the West feels like about 80 minutes of material was padded out to 110 minutes.	The problem isn't just that MacFarlane is a bad actor, but that Anna's character makes absolutely no sense.	They could have just called it A Million Jokes Die in the West So That Six May Work.	Perhaps Seth MacFarlane thought that this would be a Blazing Saddles for a new generation, yet A Million Ways to Die in the West belongs way, way on the other side of the western comedy spectrum.	While it offers a few laughs and boasts a talented cast, Seth MacFarlane's overlong, aimless A Million Ways to Die in the West is a disappointingly scattershot affair.
Pretty darn good, despite its smarty-pants aura.	Becomes richer, deeper and more interesting than just a coupling of naked bodies on screen.	Sex ironically has little to do with the story, which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never, ever, leave a large dog alone with a toddler. But never mind all that; the boobs are fantasti	A visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification.	A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel.	Beneath the gratuitous nudity lies a complex and visually striking movie.
It's all very corny and much of it's almost alarmingly overbaked... Yet it works.	Sappy fun	An otherwise fine sports fantasy is dragged down by an overindulgence in sentimentality.	The Natural is an impeccably made, but quite strange, fable about success and failure in America.	Robert Redford isn't playing a 1930s baseball hero ... he's playing an instrument of God.	Though heavy with sentiment, The Natural is an irresistible classic, and a sincere testament to America's national pastime.
[Audiard] combines a flair for enlivening genre conventions with a careful approach to his characters.	Their fascinating interdependence gives way to a power struggle built on unspoken trust and a series of daring demands.	May be the finest thriller/romance hybrid of the new century.	Devos and Cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension, while never really vocalized, is palpable.	"Read My Lips" surprises by making the viewer care more about the characters than the plot.	A clever and offbeat character study about two people discovering each other.
...The speeches are so deadening, I thought the projectionist had slipped in the last reel of a John Sayles picture.	The film may be more of a sad commentary on the human condition than traditionally sad in the manner Arcand intended.	Like an alchemist, Arcand has transformed a film of ideas into an emotional experience.	The movie is brutally funny and ironic about the way this corrupt world is manipulated by the cynical Sébastien.	Arcand does a fantastic job of establishing these folks to the point where we really feel like we know them...	A moving and heart-felt film from director Denys Arcand.
Miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise, expertly plucking tension from quiet.	At its best when the guarded, resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center.	An ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation.	Sometimes scary, sometimes sad and always thought provoking.	At heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance.	Alias Betty works both as a gripping thriller and as a precisely drawn character study.
Breaking through any period piece mustiness with piercing insight into the emotions and behavior of her characters.	A heavenly delight.	Silence and stillness, as well as the restrained desire of its lovers, are given their due. After the clatter and rush of the summer flicks, patience is demanded but also rewarded.	Campion's big-sisterly encouragement of Cornish's lovely, openhearted performance -- and Whishaw's well-matched response -- results in a character instantly, intimately recognizable to anyone remembering her own first love.	If John Keats is the catalyst who inspired Miss Campion to make this film, and us to go see it, it is Fanny Brawne, the bright star of the film's title, who makes it worthwhile.	Jane Campion's direction is as refined as her screenplay, and she gets the most out of her cast -- especially Abbie Cornish -- in this understated period drama.
The acting is as nimble as the footwork.	Easily one of the more delightful, charming and comical imports of the past couple of years.	No mere feel-good movie, it's a feel-great movie.	The whole movie plays as if AbFab and My So-Called Life were put into a blender, with the director standing above it slowly pouring a bucket of hot-pink paint into the mix. I couldn't stop smiling.	I liked Jess and her family, but why did the movie have to be so formulaic and predictable?	Inspiring, compassionate, and with a sly undercurrent of social commentary, Bend It Like Beckham is a lively feel-good movie that genuinely charms.
Shore and Wilde have done an admirable job in re-imagining Wilde's play as a movie, and they've created a wrenching, thoughtful entertainment that incorporates considerable comic relief.	The performances are solid throughout, and the writing is straightforward and tight.	Funny, well made, and thought provoking on many levels.	A coming-of-age movie with soul and substance.	Get Real is a sweet-natured coming-out comedy from England that seems to be coming out about 10 years too late.	An authentic portrayal of homosexuality in high school, Get Real is an engaging dramedy that doesn't sermonize its audience nor trivialize its characters.
A subterranean survival epic that expertly tightens the screws even as one wishes it would keep a tighter mouth-clamp on its increasingly whiny characters.	Here and there an image of spectral beauty, assisted by the 3-D technology, floats into view and captures our imagination. But the script, which really should've been called "Sanctimonium," has a serious case of the bends.	There's no real story here, just a series of gruesome yet weirdly casual deaths, taking place in what looks like the inside of a very big stomach.	Falls somewhere between the disaster genre and the horror genre ... but it's not campy enough for the former, and not scary enough for the latter.	Predictable. But the chills and thrills work, and it is gorgeous to look at.	Sanctum is beautifully photographed, and it makes better use of 3-D technology than most, but that doesn't make up for its ham-handed script and lifeless cast.
Playing beautifully both to fans and haters, Williams' Sy is a character you don't know whether to hug or go vigilante on his ***	Robin Williams fans have seen all the faces and heard all the voices before, but rarely have so many skills combined to forge one creepy, unforgettable character with such uncharacteristic subtlety.	It's a tightly organized film, and you can see why it was a hit at Sundance. In fact, it may be the ultimate "Sundance" movie.	One Hour Photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight.	There are weird resonances between actor and role here, and they're not exactly flattering.	Robin Williams is very effective in this creepy, well-shot thriller.
The film mostly revels in nostalgia and feels numb.	...only marginally entertaining.	Brian De Palma's version blends style, violence and a host of fine character portrayals into a rousing, point-blank period film.	A big film, an exciting film, and it will likely be the big film of the summer.	Few old TV shows have been brought to the big screen with such élan as Brian De Palma's majestic adaptation of the 60s small screen classic The Untouchables.	Slick on the surface but loaded with artful touches, Brian DePalma's classical gangster thriller is a sharp look at period Chicago crime, featuring excellent performances from a top-notch cast.
I was overwhelmed, I was caught up in its headlong energy.	Altered States explores the human drive to leave the body behind, to be born again, and to experience in the mind things that were once thought divine.	Visually dazzling loopy drug film.	Trippy, odd and more than a mite inaccessible, but you sure as heck won't be bored.	William Hurt at his weirdest	Extraordinarily daring for a Hollywood film, Altered States attacks the viewer with its inventive, aggressive mix of muddled sound effects and visual pyrotechnics.
One of the better new movies in town, and better in a genre -- science-fiction -- that at the crucial middle level where the history of movies is made, if not written, has recently been not so much bad as invisible.	the film is a highly satisfying mix of satire and suspense	Passable entertainment, but it's no fun watching the likable, witty Cornelius and Zira become hairy martyrs.	This second sequel serves as little more than a light appetizer with a memorable and poignant ending.	It works fairly well as the central movie of the franchise but will have little to offer non-devotees.	One of the better Planet of the Apes sequels, Escape is more character-driven than the previous films, and more touching as a result.
Adapted from the 1949 memoir by two children of pioneering efficiency experts Frank and Lilliann Gilbreth, the film now has a title that doesn't really make sense, but it gets modern-day mileage for its even more improbable premise.	It's rare to see a film that is not just squeaky-clean in content, but in its very philosophy. The fact that it's also a funny, warm, entertaining film is almost just icing.	Surprisingly mean-spirited, unfunny and features possibly the most annoying ensemble of child actors in recent memory.	By starring in three of the worst comedies of 2003, Steve Martin has officially turned himself into the Anti-Comic.	The laughs are strictly budgeted in this TV-tuned family outing.	In this family of twelve children, much chaos ensues, but little hilarity.
The film seems pitiless as it records every detail but, as you watch a man who clings to life and an ambulance driver whose search for a hospital becomes a mythic quest, what you're left with is compassion.	It's supposed to be about a Kafkaesque experience. Instead, it is a Kafkaesque experience. Why are we here? Is everything absurd? Is anyone in charge?	... dark and overlong drama ...	The Death of Mr. Lazarescu seems effortlessly observed, even improvised, but it's actually a wonder of choreography, rhythm and social commentary.	A real-surreal odyssey through medical metropolis-as-inferno.	Shot in naturalistic style, this is a powerful indictment of absurdity and indifference in the face of human suffering.
There might not be that much insight, but there certainly is plenty of geriatric spunk.	[Albert] Maysles has a rich subject matter and tells the story of Iris Apfel's remarkable career, her marriage to husband Carl, who celebrated his 100th birthday during the making of "Iris," and her lasting influence on the fashion business.	At the heart of "Iris" is love, between Iris and the camera, Maysles and his subject, and Iris and Carl. They nailed it, this crazy life, and they're still getting a kick out of it.	The documentary leaves little doubt that Maysles was captivated by Iris Apfel, and it's probable that you will be too.	Warmly reveals Iris Apfel is more than her owlish glasses. . .Followed for a year+. . . Maysles's legendary cinema verité technique is most effective at watching her shop.	A small, insightful feature with a deceptively thoughtful thesis, Iris adds a bittersweet postscript to director Albert Maysles' filmography.
a gem that should not be missed.	Director Jafar Panahi has long been an eloquent and passionate representative for Iranian women. But judging by this deeply poignant comedy, they may not need a mouthpiece much longer.	Offside is a slow slog through bloated scenes with little happening. Framed and shot like a crude documentary, it proceeds in long, clunky takes, as if an editor couldn't be bothered.	A phenomenal work... the sort of satire where reality is its own punchline.	full review in Greek	A spirited film that explores gender politics with comedy, intelligence, and a variety of interesting characters.
Plays like The Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland crossed with a middling episode of "The Muppet Show" guest-starring David Bowie … suffers from a distinct lack of charm.	The chaotic narrative proceeds in fits and starts, and the sights and sounds are often dated, but somehow the film's wit and wonder linger in the mind.	Wonderful, magical cult movie for kids.	If, like most of its fans who caught up with the film through VHS and afternoon television airings on the ABC, then seeing it on the big screen will surely rank as one of the most eye-opening, fantastical experiences of the year.	Great energy and creativity went into the construction, production and direction of this movie, but it doesn't have a story that does justice to the production.	While it's arguably more interesting on a visual level, Labyrinth provides further proof of director Jim Henson's boundless imagination.
...a triumph of evidence on how one person's actions can begin a groundswell of change.	There are moments when The Interrupters feels like a real-life version of The Wire, with weary heroes trudging forever uphill to make their ugly world a slightly better place. The problem is that it's a very repetitive film.	Once again, James' trustworthy work demonstrates the power of paying attention.	Reality movie-making at a high point.	A tour de force of editing that's similar in novelistic scale to Steve James's high school basketball epic Hoop Dreams.	Impeccably crafted and edited, The Interrupters is a tough and honest documentary about street violence that truly has the power to inspire change.
Blood Work finds [Eastwood] on auto-pilot -- delivering what we expect so lazily that most of it feels like a bloated tv cop-drama from the 70s.	A worthwhile thriller.	By the end of the film this fascinating character study looses all credibility at the hands of an age-old, Hollywood stereotype.	Eastwood returns to the crime beat one more time with rudimentary potboiler material.	Far-fetched and trite.	Blood Work is a routine, but competently made thriller marred by lethargic pacing.
Peosay appears to have taken the Dalai Lama's non-violent philosophy to heart. Rather than rage, his film radiates sadness over a singular way of life in danger of imminent obliteration.	If you're not at least a little bit moved by some of the more heart-rending stories told here, you might need to have your (metaphorical) heart checked.	Part political thriller, part National Geographic travelogue, Tom Peosay's documentary is a distressing look at China's 50-year repression of the people of Tibet.	A polemic posing as a documentary, but an effective one.	Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion will make even the most apolitical viewers want to hoist their own Free Tibet banners.	Makes no effort to do more than present one side of its story, but does it so passionately and persuasively that the viewer almost cannot help but be moved.
it could have been worse	The film's directors, David Moreau and Xavier Palud, bring nothing new to the table, and they aren't even particularly adept at reheating the leftovers.	The Eye remake rolls off Hollywood's Asian horror assembly line like expired goods that have been repackaged.	The real movie is Jessica Alba as a blind girl... Even the story of an eye transplant recipient would be cool, watching her adjust to the world of vision. Luckily, the bulk of the movie is that. That makes it classy and grown-up.	Turns out seeing dead people can still be kind of a thrill.	Featuring wooden performances and minimal scares, The Eye is another tedious remake of an Asian horror film.
One of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved.	A small, quiet movie, full of surprises and powerful character moments.	A decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies.	The sisterly writing team of Karen and Jill Sprecher create that deadly form of cinema, the play mistaken for a movie.	A piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness.	Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is an intelligent and poignant look at lives intersecting.
Panahi's latest film about the downtrodden of Iran explores the humiliations of class distinction...a thought provoking film	There are a couple of engaging sequences...but indeed the remainder is mostly mediocre, and ultimately forced.	An incisive portrait of one man's quiet rage at, and heartbreakingly violent response to, social inequality.	A work of poetry	Jafar Panahi's "Crimson Gold" is a worthy entry into the pantheon of that country's contribution to the art of filmmaking.	A slow-burning, riveting film about Iranian class differences.
This new Sherlock Holmes movie asks the question, "What if Sherlock Holmes belonged to Fight Club?"	...a sporadically amusing yet thoroughly tedious misfire of nigh disastrous proportions.	The whole movie is kind of old-fashioned but also kind of modern at the same time, and I think that contrast is a big part of its appeal.	Proof that Guy Richie can still make good films, though it's not without flaws.	It's entertaining, but it's also a bit goofy -- Holmes here is a Victorian 007.	Guy Ritchie's directorial style might not be quite the best fit for an update on the legendary detective, but Sherlock Holmes benefits from the elementary appeal of a strong performance by Robert Downey, Jr.
The possibility of a fourth film is alluded to in the screenplay, but let's hope the filmmakers decide to leave that one where it belongs -- in the crypt.	Though it tries to juice up its mojo with currently popular Asian themes and martial-arts sequences, this Mummy seems a teeny bit musty.	I've read Choose Your Own Adventure novels with better narrative cohesion. And better dialogue, chemistry, and drama too.	I mean, honestly, how does somebody screw up a Yeti attack?	Violent action sequel should've stayed buried.	With middling CG effects and a distinct lack of fun, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor finds the series past its prime.
In the end it doesn't move you to action, and for activist cinema, that lack of energizing fervor is a bit of a problem, the longest yard between something good and something great.	As he did in Traffic, Gaghan intertwines his disparate subplots with impeccable pacing -- his screenplay is a model of how to arrange scenes so that each one ends leaving you wanting to know more.	A gorgeous, well-acted (by a gaggle of successful directors, in Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and Thomas McCarthy), Soderbergh-y undertaking, but it's going to go over like a fart in church.	Stephen Gaghan signe une %u0153uvre nйcessaire qui arrive au bon moment pour agrйmenter un dйbat sans que cela ne paraisse trop opportuniste.	Syriana best movie of the year	Ambitious, complicated, intellectual, and demanding of its audience, Syriana is both a gripping geopolitical thriller and wake-up call to the complacent.
All in all, a decent time at the movies.	Pierce Brosnan takes his third Bond tour, far from the worst, but also far enough from the best in the long line to make you wonder why he bothers.	Either Pierce Brosnan is starting to get the hang of being Bond or I am just starting to think of him that way, but he seems more natural than he has in the past.	a good flick	The score, by composer David Arnold, is the best in over a decade.	Plagued by mediocre writing, uneven acting, and a fairly by-the-numbers plot, The World Is Not Enough is partially saved by some entertaining and truly Bond-worthy action sequences.
Whilst not as atrocious as some other films that have opened this year, the truely woeful story and quality of Silent is saved only by its occasion moments of visual flair, and its all over effective creepy atmosphere.	When everything starts being explained, the mystery evaporates and the world of the game loses its eerie bafflement.	As a fluke, I took my mom (also named Rose) to the screening. She doesn't like SF or horror and doesn't even know what a video game is, yet she ended up really liking it! How weird is that?	It's one of the best video game adaptations I've seen in years.	Visually arresting but only sporadically enthralling.	Silent Hill is visually impressive, but as with many video game adaptations, it's plagued by inane dialogue, a muddled plot, and an overlong runtime.
It often seems endless in the possibilities of its human observation.	Boasting a career best performance by Jack Nicholson in the lead role, Rafelson's movie is a penetrating study of American alienation.	Five Easy Pieces (1970) is a moody character study of an alienated, misfit drifter. It tells the story of a rough-neck California oil rigger	The film, superbly directed by Rafelson, shifts the late 1960s hippy drop-out genre into the Ingmar Bergman class: it's cerebral, yes, but also moving and witty.	A key turn-of-the-decade film, with Nicholson railing against waitresses and barking at noisy dogs as Rafelson observes seedily picturesque roadside America.	An important touchstone of the New Hollywood era, Five Easy Pieces is a haunting portrait of alienation that features one of Jack Nicholson's greatest performances.
A serious treatment of the Superman comics...	Superman, The Movie is a rousing screen version about America's foremost folk hero.	Vem envelhecendo bem justamente por compreender que, mais do que respeitar o espectador (e respeita), é fundamental respeitar seu próprio universo.	Superman is a pure delight...	The person we will remember the most is Christopher Reeve as Superman, and this is the way he should be remembered . . . You will still believe a man can fly.	Superman deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast Christopher Reeve to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon.
[Director Cate] Shortland directs with an almost hypnotic focus, favoring Lore's immediate experience over the big picture.	Worthwhile, but so subtle that it's frustrating.	An intimate study in the loss of innocence. Just as Somersault launched Abbie Cornish's career, Lore will no doubt do the same for lovely German newcomer Saskia Rosendahl, whose sensitive and poignant performance captures every complexity	Lugubrious, snail-paced, dramatically inert wartime drama.	In the chaos of 3rd Reich's end. . .contemporizes the look and feel of overwhelmed, exhausted teens sifting through continuing lies and denials of the truths by everyone.	Newcomer Saskia Rosendahl gives an astonishingly assured performance in the title role, and director Cate Shortland establishes a delicate, disturbingly ominous tone in the powerful World War II drama Lore.
Leaves behind a surprising afterglow and allows you to appreciate Joe Strummer's warmth.	Compelling viewing, even for people who don't care a bit for the punk scene.	[Director] Temple succeeds in creating a portrait neither glowing nor damning, but representative of a remarkable man.	'Should you stay or should you go' really is the ultimate question.	One of the most compelling documentary portraits of a musician yet made.	Displaying Joe Strummer warts and all, The Future is Unwritten succeeds as both an engrossing documentary and a comprehensive examination of one of music's most legendary figures.
Cera proves that he can also do more than capitalize on his boyish face.	Michael Cera can't forever play a teenage boy in search of lust. That's a shame, because there are a lot of lousy movies in this genre, and he's in the good ones.	Perhaps this all works better on the printed page, where readers don't actually have to watch the character behave so rudely. (Or better before Cera rewrote much of the script.)	It's not earth-shaking, but it's diverting and polished.	A fresh, funny take on the classic coming-of-age tale, and a chance for Cera to show us what he's made of.	It may not entirely do its source material justice, but Miguel Arteta's Youth in Revolt is a fun, funny comic romp that lets Michael Cera stretch a little and introduces filmgoers to a major find in Portia Doubleday.
For a piece of propaganda, this has a lot more artfulness than you'll recall, replete with quiet moments of public mourning and a stirring flag-hoisting (dyed red on the new print, too).	As agitprop, Potemkin is a masterpiece. As art, it leaves something to be desired.	The direction of Sergei Eisenstein is original and powerful.	If you only ever see one silent, this is the one it should be.	Potemkin is a vital viewing experience that transcends its landmark/milestone status.	A technical masterpiece, Battleship Potemkin is Soviet cinema at its finest, and its montage editing techniques remain influential to this day.
Improves when it takes a more serious tone and Zaza and Judith develop into deeper characterizations.	Takes a look at an Old World, passionless arrangement in a way that is at once so biting and so brutally honest that you chuckle first, then shudder.	'...young, savvy cinematic sensibility framed by the limitations of a conservative, unrelenting culture.'	Using an endearing cast, writer/director Dover Kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships, both sexual and kindred.	A closely observed, somewhat funny, ultimately very sad movie.	An observant black comedy about arranged marriages and tradition.
It's too drawn-out, too talky and, at the most crucial moment, needlessly implausible, to sustain its humor and large dose of violence.	I didn't particularly want to like Freeway, but I couldn't help myself. Reese Witherspoon made me.	[The] characters are crisp and fascinating, and the movie has a great anything-can-happen B-movie excitement feel to it.	Both grimly funny and thought-provoking.	Shockingly dark and nasty take on the Red Riding Hood tale.	A modern update on the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, Freeway is an audacious black comedy with a star-making performance from the young Reese Witherspoon.
It validates my faith in the disreputable.	Apart from a few nerve-jangling moments at the start and some snazzy digital effects, this is about as pointless and unnecessary as sequels get.	Gruesome and suspenseful, it could be interpreted as timely commentary on U.S. overconfidence in Iraq.	28 Weeks Later doesn't match the impact of its predecessor.	The movie has some vivid shock touches and the scenes of depopulated London are queasily strange. Still, this is really about a grimly ravaged couple and two kids put through hell. Your idea of fun? Munch on it.	While 28 Weeks Later lacks the humanism that made 28 Days Later a classic, it's made up with fantastic atmosphere and punchy direction.
Burton's direction ...l is episodic and tonally uneven in its acting, but he socks over an emotional payoff with the film's conclusion.	Fails to engage	Burton fancies the fantasy more than he does a meaningful story	Belabored oddity that is one long-winded tall tale illustrated with hammy, artificial sets and gee-whiz acting.	A minnow of a movie camouflaged within the gaudy spines and barbels of some exotic species...	A charming father-and-son tale filled with typical Tim Burton flourishes.
[The] twist is worth the price of admission ... But ripping headlines out of today's newspaper and turning them into a movie rarely makes for an entertaining outing.	To call Traitor deeper than the average Hollywood thriller may not be saying much, but the film deserves credit for trying to both challenge and entertain its audience.	Traitor or Patriot? Terrorist or hero? The answer is subjective and what I like about this complex drama is that we become party to both sides.	Cheadle and Pearce are equally good in their roles, and their characters are given real feeling through Nachmanoff's pungent script, which provides the viewer with significant background and depth on the two leads.	The Traitor manages to get right is what so many other post-9/11 films got wrong: it does not confuse criticism of American policy with an attack on American ideals.	Despite another reliable performance from Don Cheadle, Traitor suffers from too many cliches and an unfocused narrative.
We have here a movie that's pitch-perfect one minute and awkwardly schmaltzy the next.	The cast is strong and the irregular structure works perfectly. Welcome back, Mr. Reiner.	Flipped is essentially a Hail Mary pass designed to remind us that director, producer and co-screenwriter Reiner is the guy who made Stand By Me.	The central character is so mealy and formless that you hope he'll get hit by a truck or otherwise disappear, replaced by a character with whom you actually want to engage.	This is a slow, pretty, one-dimensional undertaking. The story is free of any real conflict or depth -- it's just kind of big and shiny, not unlike an expensive Hallmark greeting card.	While not without its nostalgic charms, Rob Reiner's sometimes awkward adaptation of Wendelin Van Draanen's childhood novel doesn't reach the heights of the director's earlier work like Stand By Me.
Tarsem has found a home for his endlessly unique visions, and (wouldn't you know?) it's beyond artifice and stealing toward art.	Visually sumptuous but marred by a fragmented tale.	It's like a Terry Gilliam fantasy directed by Zhang Yimou and reimagined by a child...	Dazzling and delirious, The Fall is a celebration of cinema, of old-fashioned storytelling and globe-hopping spectacle.	There's no doubt that Tarsem's a visionary director. Now he needs to envision a worthwhile script for himself.	More visually elaborate than the fragmented story can sometimes support, The Fall walks the line between labor of love and filmmaker self-indulgence.
Both fantastic and flawed...	I daresay most viewers will enjoy themselves. I already look forward to the next one.	...recognizes that it's okay to present scariness, gloominess and sadness, as long as you present strong, pure hearted children whose inherent cleverness cuts through it all.	This is a beautifully designed, impressively directed film with exciting action sequences and terrific comic performances from its cast.	You can't make entertainment lemonade out of this lemon of a movie.	Although it softens the nasty edges of its source material, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a gothic visual treat, and it features a hilariously manic turn from Jim Carrey as the evil Count Olaf.
Lame scatalogical gags and worn pop-culture parodies abound, but the CGI animation romp is somewhat redeemed by the scene-stealing appearances of several supporting characters.	Rental material, at best.	A foursome of digitally animated zoo animals escape the inner city confines of Manhattan's Central Park Zoo in search of freedom that's not be all it's cracked up to be in this well-defined children's comedy.	...an engaging little diversion that maintains its charm with repeat viewing.	Highly recommended for kids and adults.	Though its story is problematic in spots and its humor is hit-or-miss for the adult crowd, Madagascar boasts impressive visuals and enough spunky charm to keep children entertained.
Hausner's film feels authentically quiet and slower-paced for the time period ...	Jessica Hausner's Amour Fou frames German Romanticism from a female perspective, gently poking fun at the true story of the selfish, pompous poet Heinrich von Kleist and his suicide pact with Henriette Vogel in 1811.	There's no blood pumping through Hausner's characters' veins.	If this is intended as a sly satire of Romanticism's extremes it works a treat.	One thing's certain: This is no swoony love story. It intoxicates all the same.	Amour Fou risks overpowering its deceptively impactful story with its remarkable visuals, but ultimately forms a fascinating whole.
The unobtrusive visual style respects both the human characters and the wider landscape, with Davaa shooting her compositions in medium and long shot.	Think of this as Old Yeller in Outer Mongolia.	The friction between her real-life protagonist clan's traditional customs and the outlying modern world remains the backbone of Davaa's ethnographic cinema.	Unless you're an absolute sucker for puppy dogs and precocious girls, you might find your attention wandering.	More successful as a documentary than a drama, this offers a gently absorbing glimpse into nomadic Mongolian life.	A sparse, hauntingly beautiful journey across continents and cultures.
Azumi may be an outstanding assassin, but the makers of this movie killed any chances of her being the next great action hero.	Sempre auto-indulgente, Kitamura estende o filme alйm do ideal e dilui o impacto das boas seqькncias de aзгo. Sua sorte й ter Aya Ueto, que mantйm o pъblico interessado.	Ryuhei Kitamura is 37, but he makes films like a 15-year-old fanboy. That is, he has no sense of story, his visual style is basically point-and-shoot, the boys are cool and rebellious and the girls are cute.	Compared with his geekily gonzo comic book/samurai/zombie splatterfest Versus, Ryuhei Kitamura's Azumi (itself an adaptation of a popular manga) is surprisingly tame and lucid.	Nothing can lift the glaze from your eyes through the endlessly recurring hokey fight scenes of the movie's interminable 128-minute running time.	This adaptation of the popular manga series offers exquisitely choreographed violence -- and little else.
A remarkable true story, North Face is another dramatic demonstration that sport and politics are indeed often fused, welded together by man's triumphalist nature	Ssuspenseful, meticulously crafted, harrowing and thrilling. It's an incredible true story about courage and the power of the human spirit.	North Face" is something of an old-fashioned epic shot with modern wisdom and technique, a man vs. nature flick that also weighs the importance of the individual vs. the social while exposing the mean cost of vicarious thrills.	One hates to be overly hyperbolic about a movie in February, but let's just say I'll be very impressed if a movie grips me with its tension as much as did this for the rest of the first quarter of 2010 (how's that for an ad pullquote?).	Anyone who loved Touching The Void will be moved by what turns into a quest for survival. This film has a bigger budget, more spectacular shots, a touching love story and a historical backdrop of the Nazi thirst for glory.	A tense and gripping spectacular piece of snow-bound historical German film-making.
Tacky and cartoonish.	Great stunts and a cool theme song, but the Harlem scenes aren't quite superfly enough for me.	It can't quite muster an explosive third act to match previous jaunts, but Moore had got his feet under the table.	I can see how many people can be entertained by this ludicrous film, but not because it's good. It features an outstanding performance from Moore and has an enjoyably bad Blaxploitation thing going on here, but not much else.	I know I probably shouldn't like Live and Let Die, but I do. This crackpot entry, the eighth, in the long-running James Bond series, is figuratively all over the map...[Blu-ray]	While not one of the highest-rated Bond films, Live and Let Die finds Roger Moore adding his stamp to the series with flashes of style and an improved sense of humor.
Not remotely scary, unless one considers the direction, script, most of the acting!	The real sacrilege is letting neophyte director Rupert Wainwright play minister to such a hopelessly convoluted script!	...a cathedral of cliches. Can a church sue a movie?	Stigmata is so bad it ultimately leaves you with the age-old question 'If there is a God why would he permit a film like this to be made?'	A derivative, pretentious rock video with a half-cocked, quote-unquote religious melodrama.	The story is unconvincing and the acting is weak.
The key problem of this acting exercise is that we can sense what must come, and sadly it does.	A film for grown-ups in which actions have consequences and consequences aren't resolved with a lecture or a hug or a gun.	A movie for grownups about four childish adults.	Uncompromising in its depiction of two marriages beyond hope.	[Y]our expectations of climax, resolution, consolation fall away and you're quite simply present in every detail of every moment.	We Don't Live Here Anymore is often overly moody and grim, but it's made watchable by the strong performances for its four principal actors.
There's something in the way that Old Dogs is brazenly, proudly lazy that makes it truly reprehensible	A spastic, noxious comedy, Old Dogs is scattershot and out of control, bludgeoning the audience with all sorts of eye-bulging mugging and dire cliché. It's insufferable and lazily directed.	Getting your uvula pierced would be less painful than watching Old Dogs.	Does no one know how to film physical comedy anymore?	There are no new tricks in Old Dogs, a broad and frenetic family comedy which puts John Travolta and Robin Williams together with two cute kids in a cozily predictable family-comes-first scenario.	Its cast tries hard, but Old Dogs is a predictable, nearly witless attempt at physical comedy and moral uplift that misses the mark on both counts.
As good as Nicholson and Fletcher are, the film simply wouldn't work without the ensemble cast that incorporates Forman's improvisational style	My basic quibble with the film is that it's part and parcel of the movies' unfortunate tendency to romanticize mental illness.	There's a lot here. But with a classic like Cuckoo's Nest, too much is never enough.	I enjoyed the picture because it is an action romance, worked out in wonderfully inventive detail and presented with mesmeric immediacy by one of the screen's most resourceful directors.	Viewed 30 years after its release, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains a very good motion picture, although one that perhaps just misses the pinnacle of greatness where its reputation suggests it resides.	The onscreen battle between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher serves as a personal microcosm of the culture wars of the 1970s -- and testament to the director's vision that the film retains its power more than three decades later.
I think if you're going to have a David Hasselhoff type of character and you're going to have the flatulence type of humor, then just go in that direction. Don't try to put in all this sappy stuff.	For Sandler, the transition from MTV cool to VH1 nostalgic seems natural, but the emotion and the longing that accompany nostalgia are still lost on an actor with limited range, trying mightily to improve himself.	With Click, Sandler has taken about three leaps backwards from Punch Drunk Love and 50 First Dates.	The latest Adam Sandler assault on the art of film is one of those films -- the kind where multi-millionaires explain to you that money can't buy happiness.	Michael never thinks big like changing mankind for the good. He would rather click-freeze a guy and pull down his pants to embarrass him. THAT's a Sandler laugh.	This latest Adam Sandler vehicle borrows shamelessly from It's A Wonderful Life and Back To The Future, and fails to produce the necessary laughs that would forgive such imitation.
A saga of blood feuds, betrayals, vendettas, and a lot of fighting The film is entertaining but more macho than intelligent.	Genghis Khan's lost decade fuels a handsome fantasy.	There's never enough detail to make these historical figures come to life in a compelling way.	For a motion picture about man who changed the world on his own terms, one would think his life story would be a riveting experience, not something that requires a pot of coffee and occasional magazine breaks to enjoy.	You might wonder how Bodrov could fail to make every minute of Genghis Khan's extraordinary life near edge-of-the-seat involving, but there are some dull stretches before the pace picks up again.	The sweeping Mongol mixes romance, family drama, and enough flesh-ripping battle scenes to make sense of Ghenghis Khan's legendary stature.
Affectionately conceived, imaginatively staged and highly entertaining.	The director ... has a clear knack for big action set pieces.	'Once Upon A Time in Mexico plays like a delirious combination of A Fistful of Dollars, The Revenger's Tragedy and Airplane.'	Convoluted and surprisingly dull.	Goes nowhere, furiously.	Violent, pulpy, loopy fun, with Depp stealing the show.
The Wolfpack explores its scenario exclusively through the voices of its subjects, and all the cryptic limitations that entails.	[VIDEO ESSAY] You can't help but root for these highly articulate and reserved kids to make good in the real world. You just might be hearing more from the "Wolfpack" as filmmakers in their own right.	Wolfpack falls short in various aspects: in the formal way because it feels like a reality show and in its chronology. [Full review in Spanish]	Takes a surprisingly tender approach to the material, never casting blame or making comments.	What a sad, strange, intoxicating movie.	Offering a unique look at modern fears and our fascination with film, The Wolfpack is a fascinating -- and ultimately haunting -- urban fable.
Rarely does a movie make me so dearly wish I could come unstuck in time.	The Time Traveler's Wife is told with a tenderness that's unusual in a major motion picture but that leads mostly to dullness.	An uninspired alternative to comic book pandemonium and solemn family dramas, a gloppy serving of late summer corn.	Good cast plus weak script equals so-so movie.	Like Henry, there are elements from the best-selling book that have simply disappeared. Humor, for one. A deeper texture. This is less of a movie than it is a glammed-up revolving door.	Though it may satisfy fans of the novel, The Time Traveler's Wife's plot contrivances and illogical narrative hamper its big screen effectiveness.
This film is a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption -- the modern high action adventure against which all others must now be measured.	Allows for a certain worldliness, cautiousness, and darkness in Indy's character. He's far from reckless or noble.	It is the classic film [by] Lucas, Spielberg...back before they were replaced by automatons put here by aliens.	The purpose of the exercise. If you can't love this film, you have no business loving movies at all.	It is intensely watchable, with the relentless accumulation of effects used here for the purposes of eliciting suspense rather than provoking comedy.	Featuring bravura set pieces, sly humor, and white-knuckle action, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most consummately entertaining adventure pictures of all time.
Derrickson didn't make any major mistakes, but he also didn't find a way to make The Day the Earth Stood Still meaningful for a modern-day audience.	Sending a flying v-sign right at the splendid Robert Wise original from 1951, this daft and pointless sci-fi remake has very little to recommend it.	A boldly mediocre remake of the 1951 sci-fi saucer-man movie.	Another reason to see the original. In this disappointing remake, it's time that stands still.	Derrickson and his team take a much-loved sci-fi classic and, even if they can't improve on the original, at least rework it in intriguing ways.	Heavy on special effects, but without a coherent story at its base, The Day the Earth Stood Still is subpar re-imagining of the 1951 science-fiction classic.
I thought the pacing was off and the characters were drawn too purely dark.	Very entertaining.	The trouble with The Ref is that it keeps running out of steam, so it seems to develop a new plot wrinkle every seven minutes. Typically, it'll run through the new idea until it runs out of steam again, then invents yet another one.	The Ref is one of those rare movies that seem to have everything going for it -- a promising director, terrific actors and an original, unapologetically grown-up script -- yet somehow still turns out to be a phenomenal drag.	The Ref is a powerfully funny adult comedy. It skewers marriage, suburban values and the trendy belief that everyone is a victim of something.	Undeniably uneven and too dark for some, The Ref nonetheless boasts strong turns from Denis Leary, Judy Davis, and Kevin Spacey, as well as a sharply funny script.
Daddy Day Care is one of those 'trailer' movies: All the good stuff, such as it is, is shown in the previews. But padded to feature length, the movie is mediocre.	Nothing that happens in the story will surprise anyone who's been watching movies for longer than the last two weeks.	Daddy Day Care is a manufactured film which is willing to capitalize on the fact that a sucker of a filmgoer is born every minute.	Maybe it's about time Murphy fired his agent and tried reviving his career.	Supporting players save "Daddy's" day in this pleasant, fitfully amusing family comedy which entertains despite an inconsistent script (Geoff Rodkey) and insipid direction	Daddy Day Care does its job of babysitting the tots. Anyone older will probably be bored.
Anyone looking to lose themselves in an engrossing fairy-tale world will be richly rewarded.	The emotions seem almost as manufactured as the sets.	Children hasn't enough of a human dimension to be 'fun' itself, but it's still warped enough to amuse anyone with a tilted frame of mind.	The City of Lost Children is a series of associated visual stimuli so imaginative and omnivorous that their spectacle has the effect of wearing us out. Nevertheless, if you think of yourself as warped, you really must see this.	Directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro have created a genuine phantasmagoria, and each of the film's stunning set pieces is more wildly imaginative than the last.	Not all of its many intriguing ideas are developed, but The City of Lost Children is an engrossing, disturbing, profoundly memorable experience.
Garry Marshall, how could you? You have made a mockery of a movie that bears the name of my birthday. I take this as a personal affront.	Another year, another holiday, another opportunity for Garry Marshall to turn all the innovation of Robert Altman and P.T. Anderson and the like into dreary, commercial crap.	All human life is here in predictably two-dimensional form, ready to confront 2012 with a brave face, a throbbing heart and a head unclouded by economic worries.	Same crap, different day.	Not much to celebrate in dull 'New Year's Day'	Shallow, sappy, and dull, New Year's Eve assembles a star-studded cast for no discernible purpose.
Maybe the movie sounds like a drab and worthy slog through misery, but it's alive, it feels true, and it got to me.	I read of thousands of women from Eastern Europe who are lured into virtual slavery. I hope some of their clients will attend this movie, even if for the wrong reasons, and see what they are responsible for.	The film's achievement ... is to bring us as deeply as anyone since Japan's great Kenji Mizoguchi has into the mind and heart of a woman who, culturally as well as economically, is too easily checked off as a commodity.	Goes too far in depicting the humiliation and cruelty heaped on Lilja	It's Moodysson's dark sense of humour to make [Lilya's] heaven the hell of merely poverty and insurmountable ennui.	A tragic, hard-hitting story about a teenager trapped in a life of prostitution.
An immaculate and utterly gorgeous murder mystery with the trifecta of wonderful direction, great acting, and a plot that twists and turns at every such occasion.	The bits never add up to anything resembling a satisfying whole and while you keep expecting a film with a cast of this caliber to eventually pull a rabbit or two out of thin air.	Guys will envy Norton, whose greatest trick has got to be his ability to materialize Jessica Biel out of thin air.	The pleasure of The Illusionist lies in its luxuriant belief in old-fashioned verities like character and storytelling; it's as thin as a sheet of marbled endpaper and as cleanly crafted.	Dogged by an inert, stale aura that overcomes everything and everyone in the movie.	The Illusionist is an engrossing, well-crafted story of mystery, magic and intrigue that is certain to enchant, if not hypnotize, audiences.
This simplistic teen drama features an engaging young star but doesn't miss a "follow your dreams" cliche.	A cool blend of Puerto Rican and Nuyorican rhythmic, racial and family ties that bind, Feel The Noise likewise taps into a hot fusion of African derived sounds and sensibilities that connect those multiple cross-continental roots together.	How do you say "sappy Horatio Alger tale" in Espańol?	Reggaeton has officially come of age: The burgeoning subgenre now has a terrible, opportunistic exploitation movie to call its own.	First-time screenwriter Albert Leon appears to have turned for music industry insight not to his famous producer (who has no excuses) but to other music-themed movies (Mariah Carey's Glitter, perhaps?).	Despite the different musical genre, Feel the Noise is as generic as any music-themed film that has come before it.
The only worthwhile character is bad guy J.P. (Joel David Moore), a gaming prodigy with a Gollum-like multiple-personality disorder... J.P. suggests a subtle, unconscious awareness of how stupid the whole movie is.	Grandma's Boy is what would result if Adam Sandler and his high profile co-stars bailed on a movie and the understudies took over.	No one here has the slightest idea what being elderly actually means or that old folks may once have been (and may still be) far hipper than the young men and women looking at them with fond incomprehension.	A brain-dead piece of slacker swill, worse than the worst Sandler, Schneider or Spade movie ever made.	There is no movie. There is only the fact that Adam Sandler has cronies, and Adam Sandler gets what he wants.	A gross-out comedy that's more gross than comedic, Grandma's Boy is lazy and unrewarding.
Predestination is a hair-raising, emotionally resonant thriller that fleshes out Heinlein's minimalist conceptual piece with strong characterization and an absorbing story line about domestic terrorism and murder.	An ambitious, slow-to-reveal, and overly meditative failure.	One of the few truly thought-provoking science-fiction thrillers to emerge in the last few years. Snook and Hawke are excellent.	A stylish sci-fi adventure anchored by strong performances from Ethan Hawke and Australian newcomer Sarah Snook.	A funny, affecting, twisted tale, which demands you pay close attention to every throwaway detail.	Fun genre fare with uncommon intelligence, Predestination serves as a better-than-average sci-fi adventure -- and offers a starmaking turn from Sarah Snook.
If you want to get a sense of how this differs from its immediate competition, Lords of Dogtown, look no further than the roles played in both by America Ferrara.	Not everything is resolved in this gem of a movie, but one thing comes through with stunning clarity -- the importance of having good friends you can count on.	All four stories are heartfelt, and this cast of able and awfully likable girls can work the comedy and coming-of-age drama without going sappy.	You may not literally laugh or cry, as the ads promise. But you'll have a good time watching the dream-fulfilling denims make their comic-romantic rounds.	By creating some endearing and genuine teenage characters, the movie really gets to you by the end. ... I cried.	This adaptation of a beloved novel charms with its heartwarming tale of friendship and young adulthood; realistic portrayals of the lives of teenage girls lend the comedy-drama sincerity, and may capture hearts outside the female-centric demographic.
These things no longer surprise or tantalize us as they once did. In a very short time, science-fiction films have developed their own jargon that's now become a part of the grammar.	Ridley Scott's new cut won't change the way people think about the movie, but it reinforces the film's strengths without alienating the series' biggest fans.	What makes Alien truly terrifying is Scott's vision of a future where the line between man and machine is disappearing.	Still one of the creepiest, scariest, most shocking films ever.	It remains a benchmark of extra-terrestrial horror, and gave us a bona fide A-list star in the shape of Sigourney Weaver.	A modern classic, Alien blends science fiction, horror and bleak poetry into a seamless whole.
The Karate Kid Part III is a brave but misguided attempt to restate the lesson through a narrative ploy that nearly always works, but here produces no more than recycling.	The unevenness of The Karate Kid movies reaches its peak in The Karate Kid Part III...	From hero to punk in 2 hours.	Morita still charms, Macchio still tightropes between petulence and raw optimism, whilst the fight scenes are competent enough to offset the woeful romantic sub-plotting.	The series finally runs out of steam	Inspiration is in short supply in this third Karate Kid film, which recycles the basic narrative from its predecessors but adds scenery-chewing performances and a surprising amount of violence.
It's every bit the crowd-pleaser its predecessor was.	"Analyze That" is one of those crass, contrived sequels that not only fails on its own, but makes you second-guess your affection for the original.	De Niro needs to play another mobster like Martha Stewart needs to take another stock tip, but he broadens his already-big performance as a tough mook who gets all touchy-feely.	It's a choppy mess. Comedy without rhythm is barely comedy, a point proven by the outtakes that run during That's closing credits. They're funnier than 90% of the film's actual content.	While it's fun to see DeNiro poke fun at the image that he's helped make so famous, the film just doesn't have enough of a storyline to keep your interest	The one joke premise is stretched a bit thin in this messy sequel, but a few laughs can be had here and there.
Lack of sympathy for the beautiful but flaky heroine undermines the dramatic framework of "House" like a swarm of hungry termites.	The most assured English language debut to hit screens since the equally dark and creepy American Beauty.	House of Sand and Fog doesn't deliver on the gut level of contest, and neither does it offer any other terms in which it does deliver for the audience.	A balanced tale of the American Dream gone awry, made compelling by outstanding performances from Kingsley and Connelly.	Pacific Heights with Oscar aspirations.	Powerful and thought provoking film.
... both ferocious and lyrical, a moody horror film with the frontier community romanticism of a John Ford Western and the violent ferocity of a Sam Peckinpah film.	As much as it is a horror film and western, it is equally and perhaps more pronouncedly a romance.	Bigelow's artful handling of the magic and menace of the night is hauntingly apparent.	The great Kathryn Bigelow made her solo directorial debut, and managed to emphasize the relationships between the characters while using the gory showstoppers as support.	Seductively lensed, sparely scripted and superbly performed, this does away with Gothic nonsense to offer a modern take on the undead myth.	Near Dark is at once a creepy vampire film, a thrilling western, and a poignant family tale, with humor and scares in abundance.
A magnificent new edition of the Coppola film.	Where Apocalypse Now once strained for greatness without quite reaching it, this new version of the film, assembled by Coppola and his longtime editor, Walter Murch, has greatness firmly within its grasp.	The new version adds a weight and depth lacking in the original cut.	Almost an hour of new footage has been added to the film, making an already long film even longer, but not better.	Those who loved the original Apocalypse Now will find more to admire. Those who found the original self-indulgent and pompous may now find it even more so.	The additional footage slows down the movie somewhat (some say the new cut is inferior to the original), but Apocalypse Now Redux is still a great piece of cinema.
Great fun to watch -- and not just for kids.	A wondrous, mind-boggling and impossibly clever movie that may, given a decade or two for hindsight, emerge as the most remarkable film of this high concept era.	Supremely entertaining -- especially for adults.	If the pleasures of Who Framed Roger Rabbit are mostly incidental, they are certainly more than considerable.	A spectacular blend of live-action and animation.	Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an innovative and entertaining film that features a groundbreaking mix of live action and animation, with a touching and original story to boot.
High production values, and a cast that includes Joan Cusack and Stanley Tucci, elevate the movie above its after-school-special limitations.	This classy, heart-on-its-sleeve movie is packed with laudable life lessons and Depression-era trivia.	Kit is sweet without being sappy, cute without being cloying.	Kit Kittredge is a dutiful bore.	The packaging looks good for the most part. But there's still some assembly required.	Refreshingly sweet and sincere, Kit's doll-and-book-inspired do-good mystery may be geared towards the tween girl but will please audiences of all ages.
More zombies, more babes, and yes - more dogs covered in K.C. Masterpiece . . . Sometimes less is more, but sometimes more is REALLY more.	Not ingenious by any stretch - the dialogue has moments of being undercooked and times where it's pared too close to the bone to leave more room for action.	First-time director Alexander Witt is content to supply quick cuts of incomprehensible motion instead of lingering shots of the undead horde; any suspense he attempts to create is quickly supplanted by histrionics.	Might not be quite as loud and dumb as its predecessor, but it's darn close.	The undead are back to stumbling in the dark, sometimes even in blurry slo-mo, making the many packs of them about as terrifying as the mobs waiting for Matt and Katie outside the Today studio.	Resident Evil: Apocalypse has lots of action, but not much in terms of plot or creativity.
When a true comic masterpiece comes around that's truly a cause for celebration. Start celebrating: it's here.	This is as brilliant a deconstruction of any genre I've seen since Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.	It's so effortlessly formed, so wholly its own entity that you consistently find yourself giddy with satisfaction at how good the film makes you feel. In a domain that's forgotten how to satisfy, Hot Fuzz is the very definition of a crowd pleaser.	What those hilarious Shaun of the Dead guys did for zombie flicks, they do for buddy-cop movies in Hot Fuzz. Be careful not to call it a spoof, though.	... as if a cop movie spoof had been awkwardly rammed into a seriously splatter film, with a big, violent blowout finale to blur the lines between the two.	The brilliant minds behind Shaun of the Dead successfully take a shot at the buddy cop genre with Hot Fuzz. The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody.
Carlos is exciting entertainment, even if its subject's two-decade reign of terror is reprehensible.	Carlos deserves mention alongside the greatest suspense thrillers ever made.	Carlos suggests that the genre-hopping Assayas could maximize his own ambition even within the tight confines of a prison drama.	Directed by the eclectic Olivier Assayas, it's a three-part made-for-TV movie that offers compelling watching but not much insight.	Carlos was like a terrorist version of James Bond, a high-living, jet-setting playboy terrorist for hire.	Despite its hefty running time, Carlos moves along briskly, thanks to an engaging story, exotic locales, and a breakout performance by Edgar Ramirez.
The film's knotty relationships and crisp dialogue are surpassed only by Douglas' captivating turn as a troubled heel whose pathetic behavior fools no one, least of all himself.	How to root for Michael Douglas' lost soul	Douglas gives a tour de force performance here and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. While I couldn't really buy Kalmen's behavior based on his motivations, Douglas does a tremendous job of selling this character anyway.	The film courageously shows its reprobate hero sliding further, not redeeming himself.	A truly impressive portrait of self-destructive, smooth-talking alpha males, and a testament to an actor who waltzes across that Peter Pan-syndrome tightrope with the greatest of sleaze.	Built around a singularly unpleasant main character, Solitary Man needed a flawless central performance to succeed -- and Michael Douglas delivers.
The film at first plays like a refresher and throwback to Hayao Miyazaki's Kiki's Delivery Service, before revealing itself to be less minimal than minor.	The Ghibli studio is in transition, but "Marnie," despite some gentle moments of reflection, is a ghost shadow of its previous masterworks.	To those film lovers attuned to quiet moments and emotional nuance, this film has a shine all its own. The old-school hand-drawn animation celebrates sweeping landscapes and but also the telling detail, revealing character through spare gestures.	It's a deeply emotional film... following the Ghibli fashion of allowing its female leads to be more than what meets the eye.	Taken as the punctuation mark on Studio Ghibli's oeuvre, it's underwhelming. Taken on its own terms, it's ... still underwhelming, but significantly less so.	When Marnie Was There is still blessed with enough visual and narrative beauty to recommend, even if it isn't quite as magical as Studio Ghibli's greatest works.
Nippers will love it (it did incredible opening weekend business in the States) but adults may find themselves idly dreaming of gin traps.	Arguably the most irritating novelty act in record history gets a CGI-updating...and the result is pretty annoying itself.	Soul-numbing.	...disposable junk that'll probably be forgotten in a month.	With such a thin plot, the CGI here is adequate yet underwhelming, and the same can be said for the gags	Though cutely rendered, Alvin and the Chipmunks suffers from bland potty humor and a rehashed kids' movie formula.
Doesn't escape the prison of its uninspired story, but the impressive visuals often make you think it does.	Grotesque extravagance and psychologically disturbing imagery of the highest quality are brilliantly melded to produce a rare masterwork of captivating visuals.	Director of commercials and music videos Tarsem Singh is like a toddler at Christmas: He's far more interested in messing about with the pretty, shiny wrapping than he is with the actual toys themselves.	Put The Cell's plot under a microscope and you'll discover mutant DNA strands from a host of other films, most notably The Silence of the Lambs and Altered States.	Writer Mark Protosevich and director Tarsem Singh, both making their feature debut, have crafted the year's first masterpiece, an insanely ambitious movie that miraculously fulfills every one of its ambitions.	The Cell offers disturbing, stunning eye candy, but it is undermined by a weak and shallow plotline that offers nothing new.
It's colorful, enjoyable and tame enough for the entire family.	Handsomely set in 15th-century France, it gracefully folds in all sorts of 20th-century values.	There are some nice enhancements to the yarn, like the stepsisters not being particularly ugly (one even turns out to be an ally), and the prince not wanting "those certain obligations that come with privilege."	Veering wildly between farce and suds, the movie never makes up its mind whether it's a spoof, a soap opera or a feminist pep talk.	The freshness of the entire affair and the exuberance of its execution, bolstered by sweet chemistry between Barrymore and Scott, goes a long way in charming the viewer.	Ever After is a sweet, frothy twist on the ancient fable, led by a solid turn from star Barrymore.
For every dork who has stood before the home stereo speakers and banged away on an invisible instrument, here at last is validation.	The film is a lovingly hilarious portrait of a bizarre and endearing pastime.	Sure, there is an infectious goofiness in watching a grown man in a red robe and Hello Kitty breastplate rock out on an imaginary ax. But the gag is spread pretty thin.	Nary a dull lick in the entire 80 minutes.	I wouldn't exactly call Air Guitar Nation the next important documentary, but as a colorful look at an admittedly goofy activity, the flick's a pleasant little winner.	It's up for debate how serious or ironic its subjects are, but Air Guitar Nation is nonetheless a funny and exciting documentary with a killer soundtrack.
Well and truly geared to a female audience who are likely to savour the fanciful plot and neatly wrapped feel-good denouement.	Every turn of Letters to Juliet is obvious and expected, even insufferable.	Doesn't have a lick of cynicism -- it's as pure of heart as they come. A fine ideal, but it feels as flat as a pizza.	Moviegoers don't like surprises in their romantic comedies, and this one plays it particularly safe.	The feel-good Seyfried movie of the year -- though that's not such a hard feat when your two other yearly releases include a Nicholas Sparks weepie and a twisted Atom Egoyan psycho-thriller.	Letters to Juliet has a refreshingly earnest romantic charm, but it suffers from limp dialogue and an utter lack of surprises.
Jaw-dropping and eye-popping (literally, at one point), "Django Unchained" is a prime example of the glories that can result from a master filmmaker working at the peak of his powers.	Incendiary and proud of it. The work of a master at the top of his game.	Django Unchained is pure, if not great, Tarantino.	Django Unchained is classic Tarantino.	Possibly Tarantino's most thoughtful and even political film to date.	Bold, bloody, and stylistically daring, Django Unchained is another incendiary masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino.
Graced with honest performances by the entire cast, The Italian is nevertheless a frustrating disappointment that promises much more than it ultimately delivers.	[Kolya] Spiridonov carries himself with such sweet, soulful determination that it's impossible not to root for him.	A waif's doleful eyes make easy tools of manipulation, and, though The Italian is guilty of abusing them for viewer approval, the final shot movingly restores their importance.	Full of cold truths and warm sentiment, this is a Dickensian tale set to the contemporary rhythms of post-Communist Russia.	The hardships and setbacks are just grim enough to be effective without plunging the viewer into Russian despair.	Poignant and unforgettable, The Italian stands out from other European melodramas. Like its extraordinary child lead, this Russian drama about an orphan's search for his birth mother is small in size and monumental in pathos.
Hopefully that audience won't be fooled by this cast's potential and the clever concept; the final product here is anything but fabulous.	Shame on English for wasting an opportunity to make a modern-day classic.	Like real women, this goes on. And on and on. For almost two hours. God, does it go on.	Diane English's abysmal remake of George Cukor's 1939 femme classic will have fans of the original growing claws.	The most disappointing aspect of The Women is how few laughs it delivers.	The Women is a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original.
Ava DuVernay won a best director's award at Sundance for Middle of Nowhere, a prize that seems fitting for the sort of film that has the kind of gravity and authority that sneaks up on the viewer.	Burrows deep into a lower working-class, primarily female African-American milieu and culture rarely presented onscreen with any sort of realism or understanding.	Its unadorned simplicity belies the exquisite thought, craft, and heart that only could have made such an accomplishment possible.	Solidly acted but aloof and slow as molasses.	This isn't about dramatic revelations and charge confrontations. DuVernay, who also wrote the original screenplay, has made a film about those moments lived between the decisions...	Wise, compassionate, and beautifully acted, Middle of Nowhere offers an early testament to writer-director Ava DuVernay's startling talent.
As a TV sitcom pilot, Head of State might have potential, but, on a multiplex screen, the execution (if not the premise) is thin.	It's mostly just bland and occasionally embarrassing.	[Chris Rock] knows what is funny and how to get a laugh, and there is enough energy in the proceedings to carry him through this lightweight entertainment.	What hampers Head of State is a weak script that's nothing more than a watered-down Cliffs Notes interpretation of political satire.	Head of State, wacky jokes and all, turns out to be too softball. It goes for easy laughs when it should be going for blood.	Head of State squanders its potentially ripe premise with watered-down satire and formulaic gags.
Can we call a moratorium, please, on movies about pampered kids with a lot of free time in which to concoct guilt trips to lay on their hard-working parents?	Most will be staring at their own watch, wondering how to get the last 92 minutes of their life back.	The clock doesn't actually stop during Clockstoppers, but time does seem to crawl.	...infused with entertaining energy and written with an adult-friendly crispness that's especially rare in movies aimed squarely at pre-teens.	Absurda, mas divertida, a premissa confere um certo grau de interesse ao filme, que ainda se beneficia do tom adolescente descompromissado.	A pleasant diversion for the young teens, but a waste of time for anyone older.
It's a subtle contribution to the literature of oppression, opposition and prison and to the never-ending discussion of art and its relationship to life.	As for Panahi, I could watch him for hours. With his film, its title, with his dignity and strength of purpose he mocks the stupidity of the regime's censorship.	What constitutes imprisonment and what constitutes a film?	[A] courageous act of artistic provocation...	Sure it is -- and a great one at that.	Through simple means and filming, This is Not a Film presents a vital political statement and a snapshot of life in Iran as enemy of the state.
Nice scenery; miserable storytelling.	Little substance beyond one or two nifty visual sequences.	It's like watching other people play video games.	Packs spectacular imagery and high-energy action into a tight 90 minutes.	It's too great of a fluid, exciting animation epic to be forgotten or lambasted.	Great visuals, but the story feels like a cut-and-paste job of other sci-fi movies.
Watts' quietly intense performance is the best thing about Veil.	Largely Masterpiece Theatre moviemaking, but of a very high order...an elegantly appointed, intelligently played picture that does Maugham's period piece proud.	This version has that element the previous films lacked: a true understanding of Maugham's belief that true love and purpose are inseparable.	The combination of a good story, fine acting and location shooting make this worth seeing.	The always surprising Watts creates a woman at once contemporary and retro. And Norton, as a producer as well as star, concedes enough space for Schreiber and the effortlessly fascinating Jones to earn their own spotlights.	Visually, The Painted Veil has all the trappings of a stuffy period drama, but Norton's and Watts's deft portrayals of imperfect, complicated characters give the film a modern-day spark.
Downey Jr. makes it all worthwhile.	Iron Man 2 is as good as the 2008 original and may be even better.	This one may provide some temporary thrills but they are empty ones that will largely be forgotten within a couple of days.	Iron Man 2 could have been just another action sequel if it weren't for Robert Downey Jnr delivering the complexity and self contradictory nature of Tony Stark, a man who is aware of his flaws but is not weighed down by them	Iron Man 2 emerges as a movie that's at war, not between Iron Man and his surfeit of enemies, but between two different movie-making instincts.	It isn't quite the breath of fresh air that Iron Man was, but this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed plot.
The boys in The Band were the real stars of the show, and seeing The Last Waltz again is to remember just how versatile they were.	[Gathers] so much talent into one theater that the stage buckles and the subject drops out of sight.	It might be the best concert film of all time.	The filmmaking is superbly controlled yet spontaneously alive.	There is a dazzling array of talent on display here, and the film surely has its memorable moments. But it articulates so little of the end-of-an-era feeling it hints at.	Among one of, if not the best rock movie ever made, The Last Waltz is a revealing, electrifying view of the classic band at their height.
Great screenplay; highly recommended. [full review in Spanish]	As self-aware black-and-white, nouvelle-vague-tribute fever dreams go, Güeros is surprisingly beautiful, inventive and convincing.	Risky, fresh, irreverent and visually clever. [full review in Spanish]	A witty, emotionally authentic comedy/drama that heralds the arrival of a true filmmaking talent in first-time feature director Alonso Ruiz Palacios.	With "Güeros", Alonso Ruizpalacios, succeeds to find a place between artistic and commercial cinema.	A striking effort that synthesizes disparate influences with inventive flair, Güeros marks a bold step forward for modern Mexican cinema.
Pontypool is a sinister symphony told in three distinct and very diverse macabre movements.	For a while, this claustrophobic little horror movie is a dark little treat.	A film that wrings its terror not from gruesome imagery or sudden visual jolts but through a smart psychological rendering of our universal fear of the unknown.	The judicious use of humour makes the fear seem all the more real.	An original take on genre movies of its kind.	Witty and restrained but still taut and funny, this Pontypool is a different breed of low-budget zombie film.
Amistad is a picture you will not want to forego.	Spielberg nearly capsizes the story with his customary emotional overkil...Still, the story of Cinque...and the rest of the Africans trying to get home is powerful.	Amistad is an earnest examination of one race's fight for their rights and their freedom.	Brief moments of visceral fire allow glimpses into the rousing movie this could have been.	Spielberg errs on the side of right and moral decency, and as a cinematic essay on a subject of universal validity plus eternal currency, it deserves -- and justifies -- genuine praise both as entertainment and as history lesson.	Heartfelt without resorting to preachiness, Amistad tells an important story with engaging sensitivity and absorbing skill.
The Scorch Trials is trying to pack a lot into its running time but it still feels like a bridge between two better movies.	The world is bigger, the stakes are higher and there's a lot more to sink your teeth into.	For all the running that goes on in "The Scorch Trials," the continuation is strangely inert.	Just a prolonged series of mediocre action scenes cobbled together. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)	Builds and enhances its world and characters impressively. New ties are created, surprising conflicts emerge. You'll be invested enough for the final installment,	Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is an action-packed sequel at the cost of story, urgency, and mystery that the original offered.
The technical language, weaponry and pounding exchange of gunfire contributes to a gruesome realism without sensationalizing it.	Scenes encapsulate thrills and adrenaline rushes but our lack of emotional investment in the characters leaves an empty, hollow feeling.	Gunfire. Lots of gunfire.	It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.	Viewers who wander into the theater looking for a good old-fashioned shoot-'em-up will get a lot more than they bargained for: This is an emotionally draining experience along the lines of "The Killing Fields" and "Saving Private Ryan."	Though it's light on character development and cultural empathy, Black Hawk Down is a visceral, pulse-pounding portrait of war, elevated by Ridley Scott's superb technical skill.
There is a warmth and wit and insightfulness here that brings the film significantly up a few notches from the usual fare on this subject, and the performances are all excellent.	With an eccentric charm that falters only in a few places, the movie makes a strong statement against conformity and the franchising of America by celebrating a cast of characters and a storyline that don't fit into a mold.	Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom and his fine cast have endowed the story with a good deal of behavioral truth and unstressed comedy.	Suggests that the true heroes are those people who day by day must tend to misfits, and do so with love, tenacity and a determination not to go terminally sour in the process.	As a formula movie, it is a failure. As an interesting and likeable piece of offbeat filmmaking, it's a very pleasant -- if modest -- success.	It's sentimental and somewhat predictable, but those are small complaints, given the tender atmosphere and moving performances at the heart of What's Eating Gilbert Grape.
Game Over.	...the film has been infused with a myriad of shamelessly over-the-top elements that inevitably become quite tough to take.	Bizarre, surreal, and ultimately less engaging than playing Pong with a blind man...	OOOF!!!!!	In its noisy, pointless way, Street Fighter does come close to the frenetic meandering of a video game scenario -- which is precisely the problem.	Though it offers mild entertainment through campy one-liners and the overacting of the late Raul Julia, Street Fighter's nonstop action sequences are not enough to make up for a predictable, uneven storyline.
'It's a bomb!' Dr. Evers gasps when she first realizes the potential power of the alien force. Any audience member will agree whole-heartedly.	Avoid.	A super bore.	simple, but well paced.	A waste of time and talent.	This is an insult to the Sci-fi genre with no excitement and bad FX.
In the tradition of Christmas with the Kranks and Jingle All the Way comes Deck the Halls; another Christmas lump of coal sure to dampen the yuletide glee of anyone pumped for the holidays.	As long as atrocious, fake-pine duds like this keep making their money back, there's no such thing as a Christmas that's too commercial.	The quintessential Hollywood Christmas movie. It's Grumpy Old Christmas.	The gags land like lumps of coal, but at least the unnatural mounds of fluffy white snow remain unsullied in the dreck.	...one of those dreadful, pandering, seasonal pictures that sneaks into theaters, Grinch-like, and makes off with tons of cash each year.	Relying on flat humor and a preposterous plot, Deck the Halls is an unnecessarily mean-spirited holiday movie that does little to put viewers in a holiday mood.
Not exactly high-concept, but it is silly enough to be amusing.	Cats & Dogs is adorable, and at times quite clever, but is strictly for the kitties. Er, kiddies.	No es una gran película ni seguramente hará historia, pero si ofrece un muy buen rato de esparcimiento familiar	While the flatness of characters may bore grownups, it's an entertaining flick for kids.	A piece of formulaic fluff that will no doubt draw lots of families to the multiplex this Fourth of July holiday.	A great concept, but the movie fails to develop the characters and some of the jokes are hit-or-miss.
This lively Klasky Csupo production is a convincing amplification of the popular Nickelodeon series.	It all adds up to a cheekier Lion King on a lower budget. But what you miss in spectacle you will make up in laughs.	Surprisingly, the film is a hilarious adventure and I shamelessly enjoyed it.	On the whole, it delivers what it advertises.	There's barely enough plot here for a 22-minute TV episode and not nearly enough for an 88-minute movie.	A pleasant enough kids flick that adults may even enjoy.
... the movie has a good heart, and that's what we respond to.	Garcia gives a wonderful impression of a life-hardened non-actor finding his voice by drawing upon his own experiences.	Consider the unpretentious 'City Island' fine counter-programming to the CGI monsters, bland romantic comedies, randy teens and spandex superheroes that clog the megaplex.	The slice-of-life comedy City Island is a charming throwback filled with authentic characters.	Deceptively funny, a blithe mix of smarts and feeling that never panders to the audience.	Raymond De Felitta combines warmth, humanity, and a natural sense of humor, and is abetted by Andy Garcia and an excellent ensemble cast.
Simultaneously gripping and emotionally engaging thanks to pacey direction, a smart script and terrific performances from a fine ensemble cast.	Contagion is, by and large, about as enthralling and compelling as a typical episode of CSI: Miami.	Chilly, but not chilling, Steven Soderbergh's story of a worldwide pandemic is oddly antiseptic.	Contagion presents a frightening reality, and leaves you with something to think about.	Contagion keeps us at a distance: Rarely has the death of millions seemed so inconsequential.	Tense, tightly plotted, and bolstered by a stellar cast, Contagion is an exceptionally smart -- and scary -- disaster movie.
With 'real' Harry Potter fighting wizards all over the planet, what fun it is to have animated characters take on the big bad dragons that plagued Vikings for years.	Adults and children alike will fall in love.	Dragon is a solid comedy-adventure, though a few more laughs would have been helpful. It will delight kids and amuse their parents.	While not quite up to the bar set with Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks Animation again proves that Pixar no longer stands alone at the top of CG animated storytelling.	Dragon burns to satisfy a broad audience with a searing blend of rollercoaster action, winning comedy and actual emotion.	Boasting dazzling animation, a script with surprising dramatic depth, and thrilling 3-D sequences, How to Train Your Dragon soars.
The movie's rhythm is jumpy, accelerated and alive.	Dolan is not going to let you forget who's boss. As for myself, I quit.	Mommy is first and foremost a mother-and-son story, but it's also a surprisingly delicate exploration of lonely lives, and the temporary islands of companionship that make them bearable.	Although the performances are outstanding, and there's plenty of Dolan's trademark vigour, it's a long and at times overindulgent examination of a hyperactive teenager, his white-trash mum and their kindly neighbour.	There's not much more to Mommy than these anguished character studies. They go round and round, yet a narrative never coalesces.	As challenging as it is rewarding, Mommy finds writer-director Xavier Dolan taking another impressive step forward.
This film has madness running all the way through it, a madness that seeps from story into reality and back again.	surrealist cinema begins right here	The influence of Robert Wiene's Caligari is so great that it threatens to obscure the work itself.	Groundbreaking, but less a good film than a good idea for one.	This freshly 4K-ed masterpiece of German Expressionism deserves to be seen on the big screen. Track it down and be rewarded with possibly cinema's first ever twist ending.	Arguably the first true horror film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari set a brilliantly high bar for the genre -- and remains terrifying nearly a century after it first stalked the screen.
"Bridge of Spies" is a neat encapsulation of America's great commercial director pushing for sophistication while sticking to familiar beats.	When Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks get together the results can be harrowing and epochal like in Saving Private Ryan or they can be desultory and dull like in The Terminal. Bridge of Spies sits at an unsatisfying spot in between;	Entertaining and thought provoking, Bridge Of Spies gives real historical events a human face, and rates as a surprising crowd pleaser in the process.	Hanks does this sort of thing so well that it's mostly a pleasure to go along for the ride.	Confirms that when it comes to historic dramas, Steven Spielberg is still the best.	Bridge of Spies finds new life in Hollywood's classic Cold War espionage thriller formula, thanks to reliably outstanding work from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.
The 1980 drama hasn't aged well.	With the skill of a practiced surgeon, Redford gradually peels away the protective layers of his characters, exposing their flaws, their darkest fears and ultimately, their innermost feelings.	Story of emotional honesty is best for older kids.	Better than forever being dismissed with a huffy "I can't believe that beat Raging Bull".	It is an extraordinary achievement in an unforgettable film.	Though shot through with bitterness and sorrow, Robert Redford's directorial debut is absorbing and well-acted.
I never liked this. I never will. My apologies to all its diehard fans.	A dated, rarely funny celebration of being spoiled and white.	Ramis, Landis and their colleagues created a party film that's deeply rooted in the soil of popular culture.	A masterpiece in anarchy.	John Belushi's raucous toga party isn't for young kids.	The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Live's irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate.
A wonderful, comic fantasy that helped launch Hanks to stardom.	The movie is cute, light, and fluffy, perhaps not the laugh-fest I had remembered but enough to get by.	Line up a row of Howard's films and ask someone to choose. Chances are, their hands will fall to Splash as often as any other	Hannah does wonders with her thankless job, flitting tiny moments of joy and confusion across her face.	It's also very funny, thanks largely to Candy in the lecherous fat sidekick role, and a string of set pieces that show Hannah as, quite literally, a fish out of water.	A perfectly light, warmly funny romantic comedy that's kept afloat by Ron Howard's unobtrusive direction and charming performances from Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah.
A fascinating and eccentric character study, and study of unconventional relationships fueled by fetish...	The Graduate by way of humiliation and water sports.	Secretary is a piffle. I didn't hate it. And I wouldn't have been upset if the film had broken and the last 30 minutes were forever lost to me.	If this is an accurate portrayal of BDSM, it seems like a bit of a bore - but I think that's the point.	Shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character, is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic.	Maggie Gyllenhaal impresses in this romantic comedy with a kinky twist.
I did find myself laughing at times, and if you are a Jiminy Glick fan, you will too.	If I could do a celebrity interview with Martin Short and ask one question, it would be 'Why?'	It didn't work. There's not a movie here.	Martin Short himself is one of the funniest men alive, or can be, and has been. But Jiminy Glick needs definition if he's to work as a character.	There's a method to the madness after all.	A television sketch streatched to feature length.
It's an extraordinarily entertaining piece of work.	A masterful film about the magic of performance and the foibles of the artists behind it.	If you do not like Gilbert and Sullivan - however, if you love G&S, or even just like them, then you will enjoy this movie very well.	It ranks with Ingmar Bergman's filming of an onstage performance of Mozart's The Magic Flute.	Admittedly, at 160 minutes, it's probably too much of a good thing. But, given that so many of the film's scenes consist of productions of Gilbert & Sullivan musical numbers, who's going to complain?	A thoroughly entertaining character study and a great success for Mike Leigh.
... the best movie of 1998...	The elaborate, soaring Beloved may alight on the ground with a tap rather than a thud, but land it does, after a harrowing, breathtaking flight.	Demme succeeds uncannily well in bringing the novel's pulse to the screen.	A knot of fierce emotions that is left for the viewer to untangle. Make the effort.	A first-rate adaptation!	A powerful, emotional and successful film adaptation of the original novel.
Don't get me wrong. Street Kings clips along with brutal efficiency, but the plot that sets up Tom for a frame-up is, in critic parlance, a strain on credulity.	Street Kings is buoyed by the spirit of Keanu Reeves, who never fails to astound, at least this critic, by being consistently better than he's given credit for and nearly always better than most of the films in which he appears.	Fans of Keanue Reeves and Forest Whitaker will appreciate Reeves' heavy screen time and Whitaker's performance, but both actors deserve material that doesn't leave the viewer queasy and in need of a long shower.	Like so many thrillers with crooked moral backbones, Street Kings glamourizes the very behaviour it's condemning, lest audiences get bored by too much talk and not enough killing.	Watchable thriller with a surprisingly good performance from Keanu, although the plot isn't nearly as clever as it thinks it is.	Street Kings contains formulaic violence but no shred of intelligence.
The unrestrained (and rather excellent) trailer for Todd Field's Little Children would have us believe that the Whore of Babylon (possibly Kate Winslet) is coming for us on NJ Transit, with Pandora's Box in hand.	The success Fields has with this film comes through the uncomfortable intersection between comedy, melodrama and tragedy. Oh, and romance.	This is one of those films that sneaks up on you and offers some wonderful surprises in storytelling and performance -- and the performances are truly astounding, particularly from Winslet and Haley.	Wilson's overgrown adolescent, Winslet's bored, discontented wife and Haley's creepy, self-loathing sex offender are complex, deeply flawed characters -- they're the 'little children.'	Blame Field (remember, Perrotta also wrote the knifelike Election), for facing the material too squarely.	Little Children takes a penetrating look at suburbia and its flawed individuals with an unflinching yet humane eye.
Tarr says this is his last movie. And it feels like it. After you've ended the entire world, not with a giant planet collision like Lars Von Trier did in Melancholia but by simply shooting out the lights, what else is there?	The framing, lighting and composition are masterful, and the use of long takes from the omnipresent roving camera generates an extraordinary energy.	Ohlsdorfer and his daughter are incidental, elements in a landscape, unable to affect it or their fate, no matter their puny efforts to maintain routine, perhaps the most alarming sign of their so-called civilization.	"The Turin Horse" is an existential provocation to its audience, demanding that we consider the effect of man's judgments against nature and ultimately against ourselves.	Through Tarr's meticulous vision, these ordinary hardships take on cosmic weight; this is tedium vividly rendered.	Uncompromisingly bold and hauntingly beautiful, Bela Tarr's bleak parable tells a simple story with weighty conviction.
Another shrewdly gauged study of our capacity for deception and self-deception from A Separation's auteur. Emotionally devastating.	A remarkable film that deserves as much acclaim as Farhadi's award-winner.	A drama about guilt and responsibility set against the backdrop of male domination in Iranian society that even affects the secular and well-educated milieu depicted in this gripping drama.	It has taken six years for this terrific film to work its way back to us, and if possible I think it's even better and more relevant in 2015 than when it was made.	Digs painfully deep into gender politics among modern-day middle-class Iranians.	About Elly offers viewers performances as powerful as its thought-provoking ideas, and adds another strong entry to Asghar Farhadi's impressive filmography.
A Tex Avery cartoon of hyperbolic gore, which gets funnier with each disgusting new sight gag.	I wish I could say that I loved it, but at the risk of offending every fanboy out there, I'm afraid I have a red caro-syrup covered bone to pick with it.	If you are a little squeamish then this is not the film for you, however those of a nervous disposition need not worry as Jackson is definitely playing for laughs.	One of the true classics of splatterdom. Sickeningly wonderful.	Originally released as Braindead, this gory, maccabre satire of 1950s New Zealand society is yet another proof that Peter Jackson is one of the sharpest, most skillful directors working in the genre; a good companion piece to Meet the Feebles.	The delightfully gonzo tale of a lovestruck teen and his zombified mother, Dead Alive is extremely gory and exceedingly good fun, thanks to Peter Jackson's affection for the tastelessly sublime.
Burton's first feature revels in the weird, the unpredictable, the infantile and the absurd. A dazzling debut.	Fair warning: this movie could induce terminal boredom in adults and rot the minds of the young.	The filmmakers create a zany and surreal world for Pee-wee yet it all seems perfectly natural and credible. Plus, it's all infused with a subdued yet rampant silliness that's enchanting.	Goofy, silly, and just plain funny.	Burton demonstrates his knack for building seemingly dynamic meta-worlds inside our own world, depicting Pee Wee's own journey as exciting, harrowing, and often times scary.	Pee-Wee's Big Adventure brings Paul Reubens' famous character to the big screen intact, along with enough inspired silliness to dazzle children of all ages.
Despite some gags which use the benefit of hindsight too much for their own good, this is a smart piece of filmmaking which suggests Linklater is already one of the more formidable talents of the 90s.	You gotta love a movie, flaws and all, that's all about cars, bongs, hot girls, kegs, misdemeanors, rock and roll all night and party every day!	For a film like this, casting is everything, and the players are quite appealing.	Linklater shreds the very fabric of what's expected in a teen comedy.	Succeeds on its own terms and reflects American culture so well, it becomes part of it.	Featuring an excellent ensemble cast, a precise feel for the 1970s, and a killer soundtrack, Dazed and Confused is a funny, affectionate, and clear-eyed look at high school life.
The human toll of such ruthlessness comes through as Watts and Penn, bolstered by sharp dialogue, create attractive, smart, sympathetic characters.	If you watched the news while all this was going down, you don't really need to see this movie, but it's good that it exists.	The script, based on memoirs of their experience by Wilson and Plame, has two stories to tell -- the run-up to Iraq, and the portrait of a marriage under fire -- and combines them very adroitly.	Fair Game serves up impeccable politics with a bit too much righteous outrage and not quite enough solid drama.	Gripping real-life spy movie Fair Game, a sober and sobering account of the double-dealing of the Bush White House in the run-up to the US invasion of Iraq.	It struggles with the balance between fact-based biopic and taut political thriller, but Fair Game brims with righteous anger -- and benefits from superb performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.
For all its japes and jokes, the movie is really about exhaustion of the spirit: sitting in a bleak hotel suite at 4 a.m. with the bad taste of last night in the mouth and the feeling that tomorrow will not be a better day.	This Is Spinal Tapa comedy, but its consideration of the transience of fame and the band members' denial is ineffably and movingly sad.	Perhaps the first, and certainly the best, entry into the mockumentary genre.	It stays so wickedly close to the subject that it is very nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.	A mediocre satire of heavy rock bands.	Smartly directed, brilliantly acted, and packed with endlessly quotable moments, This Is Spinal Tap is an all-time comedy classic.
The very existence of Larry the Cable Guy would seem like a pretty good argument against the concept of Intelligent Design.	Toilet humor, jokes about paraplegics and serious overacting make this lowbrow comedy an irritating watch.	It's not a movie; it's a cause for dismay.	The job involves an upcoming cooking contest, a sleazy mayor, a corrupt restaurateur and a supporting cast of characters so ugly, stupid and hygienically revolting that they make Larry seem almost tolerable.	It was only a matter of time before [Larry] got his own critic-proof movie.	An aggressively lowbrow vehicle for its titular star, this gross-out comedy fails to "git-r-done."
Promises to be one of the summer's best date movies.	What is it about dance, that most joyous of arts, that inspires so many bad movies?	Although Dance With Me disappoints on almost every level, it still leaves you mildly elated...	Kris Kristofferson was actually cast as an experienced dance instructor -- and a man with actual emotions.	A sufficiently ebullient piece of eye candy that can stand on its own two nimble feet.	Shallow script, weak direction.
Shotgun Stories defines the classic western phrase 'doing what a man's got to do' as both a moral imperative and a biological compulsion.	Like his fellow Mason-Dixon minimalist David Gordon Green (the film's producer), [director] Nichols favors mood and ellipses over momentum and explanations, which gives this contemporary Hatfields-versus-McCoys narrative a beguiling, drifting atmosphere.	Shotgun Stories has a flawless cast, but it's the peculiarity of Michael Shannon that keeps it from becoming too obvious.	Good natural performances.	There is indeed something mythical, even scriptural, about the struggle among the seven Hayes brothers in Jeff Nichols' remarkable Shotgun Stories.	Thanks to a talented cast and its uncommon depth, Nichols' debut manages to rise above its overly familiar plot.
Not only Shyamalan's scariest and funniest movie to date, but also his most accomplished.	Though the result is too idiosyncratic to be regarded as just one more summer-movie whiff, those who see it may feel a need to act like a pool lifeguard and blow the whistle on Shyamalan.	What is most annoying about "Lady" is that no one ever considers the possibility that nothing magical is actually occurring.The film starts out silly and just gets sillier.	despite the childlike nature of the story, Lady in the Water will prove too confusing for most kids, which is a shame, since they're also the ones most like to greet that giant-eagle business with something other than a derisive laugh.	Lady in the Water is unmistakably a setback, as well as a warning to potential detractors. You are, it seems, either with M. Night Shyamalan or against him, and this time I must take up residence in the latter camp.	A far-fetched story with little suspense and unconvincing scenarios, Lady In The Water feels contrived, pretentious, and rather silly.
Gruesome yet imaginative teen psychosexual drama.	This incredible film may be director Peter Jackson's masterpiece.	What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.	The movie that first got Jackson & Winslet noticed	17-year-old Kate Winslet made her film debut in this compelling blend of true crime and dark fantasy...	Dark, stylish, and captivating, Heavenly Creatures signals both the auspicious debut of Kate Winslet and the arrival of Peter Jackson as more than just a cult director.
The film is uncharacteristically rigid and pious for Hitchcock; it feels more like a work of duty than conviction.	Even middling Hitchcock is a cut above most thrillers.	Far superior to the 1934 version, The Man Who Knew Too Much, underestimated at its 1956 release, should be considered as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.	The result is a typically memorable Hitchcock thriller, with great dialogue, building tension, and innocent people forced to get themselves out of trouble on their own.	A road trip with James Stewart and Doris Day traipsing from Morocco to London, it's two hours of red herrings and intense scenes, one of the least apologetic adventures he ever made.	Remaking his own 1934 film, Hitchcock imbues The Man Who Knew Too Much with picturesque locales and international intrigue, and is helped by a brilliantly befuddled performance from James Stewart.
Starts off like a lean, mean Walter Hill movie but ends up going a bit Blazing Saddles.	The suspense that director Patrick Hughes manages to mount remains low-grade throughout and the plot never becomes entirely plausible.	Red Hill is another heartening sign that the new generation of young local filmmakers have genre audiences clearly in their sights.	Yes, this is the land of Mad Max, so the stunts and explosions are of the highest order.	Powerful central performances drive this impressive Oz thriller which features death by boomerang.	Though its attempts to rework genre conventions may fall flat with some, Red Hill is a beautifully shot, tightly paced thriller that marks a strong debut for director Patrick Hughes.
a beautiful film both emotionally and philosophically, not to mention aesthetically	The last segment of Kiewsloski's Three Color trilogy (Blue, White) is the jewel in the crown, meditative and mystical as the others yet warmer and more accessible in large part due to Jacob and Trintingnant's appealing performances.	In this final installment of a glorious trilogy ... [Kieslowski] has saved his greatest for last.	This is the director at the top of his game.	It's a marvellous culmination of the trilogy, which together make some of the most fascinating stories in film.	A complex, stirring, and beautifully realized portrait of interconnected lives, Red is the captivating conclusion to a remarkable trilogy.
A sweet, soulful and satisfying film.	the presentation [of mountain music]evokes its deep emotions and a beauty that comes from life experience, not the pre-packaged pap courtesy of slick marketing types.	This is very PC and almost ruins the music.	This film is like a good read, as disarming in its predictability as it is in its assorted surprises and colorful ambience.	Has moments of great poignance, which outnumber the moments of predictable melodrama often enough to make the film compelling.	The story may be a bit too melodramatic, but great performances abound in Songcatcher. The real reason to see the movie, however, is the hypnotic music.
The technical virtuosity pouring from every frame is astounding.	Inception is one of the most original, thought-provoking, intense, mind-blowing pieces of entertainment I have ever seen. I would pay money to watch people's reactions.	If you think "Lost" was complicated, let's just say it's kitten chow when compared to this.	Even minor roles are filled by sterling talent (including Michael Caine as Cobb's mentor), which is testament to the originality and precision of Christopher Nolan. His is a mind that's definitely worth getting lost in.	For all of its capacity to bewilder and befuddle, Inception still must be endorsed purely on the strength of its ambition, and the awesome heights to which it sometimes soars.	Smart, innovative, and thrilling, Inception is that rare summer blockbuster that succeeds viscerally as well as intellectually.
Keeps its word.	Promises is one film that's truly deserving of its Oscar nomination.	A gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn Jerusalem.	An earnest, roughshod document, it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history, and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool.	A powerful and heart-rending documentary.	A heartbreaking and illuminating look at the Israeli and Palestinian conflict through the eyes of children.
The Host begins with a dry, frequently absurd comic sensibility, but steadily grows darker, more intense and truly thrilling.	A colorful dissection of the fiendish creature genre that touches on a number of contemporary themes.	click for full review	The film's limber and inventive director Joon-ho Bong keeps The Host creeping and leaping for its entire two hours, which are filled with incident after incident, alternately terrifying, ridiculous, suspenseful and wry.	A perfect mixture of the silly and the grave.	As populace pleasing as it is intellectually satisfying, The Host combines scares, laughs, and satire into a riveting, monster movie.
Suffers from unfortunate delusions of being an action movie that quickly overtake its potential as a comedy.	Steve Carell is square-jawed-deadpan perfect as the title character.	What do dithering tv weathermen do when they retire? They must take their lame, witless banter and their awkward timing to Hollywood to write and direct movies. That might explain Get Smart, one of the latest in a long line of humid, mediocre, tire	A mishmash...looking more like a Roger Moore Bond parody. There are numerous airplane stunt sequences, explosions and gunfights...(that) fatally bleed the character-driven humor of the original series.	Una comedia de acción irregular aunque pasable, que no llega ni por asomo al ingenio de la serie original pero que se puede ver gracias a Steve Carell.	Get Smart rides Steve Carell's considerable charm for a few laughs, but in the end is a rather ordinary Summer comedy.
The moment this movie began to go wrong, so wrong, was when the word 'angels' started working its way into the script.	Denzel Washington has the almost impossible task of holding together a convoluted picture that's only intermittently suspenseful and not very engaging emotionally or intellectually.	Despite stylish direction and some strong performances, the film ultimately becomes just another formulaic thriller -- and one with a very disappointing ending.	Fallen will sell tickets on the strength of its appealing cast and high-impact camera work, but will probably fade from the scene more quickly than its demonic villain does in the story.	Despite the dimly-lit scenes, I found the story intriguing right up until the very unsatisfying conclusion.	Has an interesting premise. Unfortunately, it's just a recycling of old materials, and not all that thrilling.
Whether the movie's message is Travers-approved or not, the emphasis on joy and empathy proves heartening, even today.	Julie Andrews' first appearance on the screen is a signal triumph and she performs as easily as she sings, displaying a fresh type of beauty nicely adaptable to the color cameras.	The grace of the effects makes it some kind of classic.	Mary Poppins is definitely worth popping for. (40th Anniversary Edition)	Mixed bag of great sequences and cutesy overkill.	A lavish modern fairy tale celebrated for its amazing special effects, catchy songs, and Julie Andrews's legendary performance in the title role.
Where's Wayne's World when you need it?	Fast-paced, nonsensical, and often hilarious!	Another scattershot adventure with a few good chuckles but not quite as funny as it believes it is--or should be.	...doesn't so much try to send up other spy films as it tries to one-up its own predecessor in this second go-round.	Scatological doesn't even begin to describe it. Heather Graham is crap too.	Provides lots of laughs with Myers at the healm; as funny or funnier than the original.
What a fresh and interesting take on the drama that lurks beneath the numbing façade of empty small-town American life.	Justine is flawed like all the rest of us, and Aniston brings this humanity to the forefront, creating one of the most realistic heroines in recent history.	You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions - disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions.	A fine cast can't quite rise above a story without enough heart.	This film has plenty of bad attitude for sale, but the black humor only delivers sporadically on the laughs.	A dark dramedy with exceptional performances from Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal, The Good Girl is a moving and astute look at the passions of two troubled souls in a small town.
It's worth catching the film just for Sedaris' performance. Surrounded and sparked by all the show's familiar characters (most played by the wonderful TV cast), she's a marvel of inspired grotesqueness.	Maybe a half-hour dose was just right, because the film's pacing is torpid and many of the jokes fall flat.	The movie never makes good on its promise of unbridled humor, but nonetheless connects with enough stabs of parody to keep it mildly entertaining.	The jokes are so sketchy and silly it quickly passes the point of wretched excess.	Not surprisingly, the film version contains about 30 minutes of hilarity, and they're stretched out at least as far as Jerri's ill-fitting slacks.	Occasionally funny, but little more than a jumbled, overextended episode of the TV show. Still, Candy devotees won't be disappointed.
Val Lewton's most brilliant and subtly sexual horror films ever made.	A Val Lewton classic that proves in horror, the less you show, the scarier the movie.	As well as being scary, the film deals intelligently with sex and the psyche.	The scariest American horror movie of the 1940s.	High-contrast frightfest with nervy lighting and production design and a well-maintained air of dread.	Influential noir director Jacques Tourneau infused this sexy, moody horror film with some sly commentary about the psychology and the taboos of desire.
Rescued from its inclination to smug, celebrity-testimonial- driven hagiography by Gehry's own considerable charm and infectious enthusiasm.	Pollack uses the film to show the a wide sampling of Gerry's stunning work, buildings that seem to defy the laws of gravity.	Director Sydney Pollack tries to pry open Gehry's head and allow the audience to see the world from his perspective.	An engaging, if incomplete, tribute that gives the director, as well as the subject, the opportunity to shine.	An intelligent, lucid and affectionate sketch of one of the world's leading architects.	This affectionate, casually framed portrait of the acclaimed architect reveals him to be an engaging, likeable subject.
Portman and the audience are stranded in the middle, on the outside looking in, with nothing to do and patience increasingly wearing thin.	Without much effort you can imagine the corkboard littered with index cards mapping out the political clashes this cast is asked to act out in their robotic interactions.	Shot mostly in close-ups, it's a fascinating road movie with an absurdist allegorical finale.	The milieu he chooses -- essentially one long, queerly prosaic car ride to nowhere -- robs the film of much of its dramatic force.	...never seems to gain much emotional traction throughout its meandering female road trip, despite some provocative subject matter.	The symbolism in this cinematic metaphor on conflicts in the Middle East becomes so overbearing that it's hard to care about the characters or their plight.
The film's power should reside in this agonised human dilemma, but in the end it becomes a rather self-important shaggy dog story.	There's a strong, unsettling sense of disease that runs through Take Shelter, the best drama of the year so far.	Shannon makes the man's dilemma plain and moving, and that gives Take Shelter a resonance that last long after the final fade out.	What you think may depend on your tolerance for movies that openly flaunt their metaphorical ambition.	Rod Serling would have been proud.	Michael Shannon gives a powerhouse performance and the purposefully subtle filmmaking creates a perfect blend of drama, terror, and dread.
Hill and Tatum ... have a Laurel-and-Hardy-like implausible chemistry that keeps you laughing pretty much no matter what they're doing.	It works well enough, more often than not, though heightened levels of raunch and chaos seem not so much meta as frantic.	Hill and Tatum remain a hilarious, unusually winning combination. They're two different flavors of nonsense, worth ordering twice.	A brazen sequel that's both slightly disappointing and a reliable, often riotous "laffer" in the old Variety trade-magazine parlance.	Maybe not up there with Gremlins 2: The New Batch but certainly one of the funniest sequels ever made.	Boasting even more of the bromantic chemistry between its stars -- and even more of the goofy, good-natured humor that made its predecessor so much fun -- 22 Jump Street is the rare sequel that improves upon the original.
Trespass is a crime, and so is this movie.	[A] putrefying piece of genre junk.	The opening 20 minutes are enjoyable enough, but then pure lameness causes the whole thing to come to pieces.	The way [Nicolas Cage] chews into the hysterically overwrought dialogue qualifies as a guilty pleasure in its own right.	Is "Trespass" the moment when we give up, and accept the path Nic Cage has chosen for himself? Or should we just keep averting our eyes, until he's done cashing easy checks?	Another claustrophobic thriller that Joel Schumacher can churn out in his sleep, Trespass is nasty and aggressive, more unpleasant than entertaining.
Theatre director Max FСrberbШck could hardly have picked a more intense and heartbreaking story for his cinema debut.	It reminds us that the Holocaust continues to be a vital source for singular, inspirational stories.	Färberböck's film is ambitious and tells a fascinating story about the unlikeliest of relationships, but it's unfortunate that there wasn't a bit more bite .	This is a showcase for the two female leads, who are superb.	A striking, poignant, and seductive saga of a Jewish lesbian in love with the dallying wife of a Nazi officer and mother of four.	A gripping examination of sexual taboos, set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany, bolstered by a subtly shaded script and a strong cast.
[Director] Gavras knowingly handles [protagonist] Kervel's little flashes of sympathy for the cause.	The film beautifully captures the interplay between self-involved parents who expect their children to embrace their beliefs and the free-thinking young girl with a mind of her own.	The young heroine is rather humorless, but Gavras's intelligence and skillful touch are evident throughout.	The film lacks a sympathetic character even in its eternally petulant child protagonist and is lax in differentiating who's who.	What makes this film a real gem is Kervel's brilliant performance, personifying this stage of growing up with a perfect balance of bratishness, bright intellect, humour and innocence. She's a revelation.	Blame it on Fidel is a charming comedy of manners, class, and politics, elevated by a remarkable performance from lead child actor Nina Kervel.
One of the best animated features in the Disney stable, this was also the box office smash that saved Walt's studio during the precarious post-war period.	the mice are the reason to see this movie	It's Lynchian--Buńuelian, too.	Disney, while sticking to the particulars of the most famous rags-to-riches story of them all, also introduced a host of delightful new characters.	A trim hour and change worth of Gerber life lessons.	The rich colors, sweet songs, adorable mice and endearing (if suffering) heroine make Cinderella a nostalgically lovely charmer.
I never once doubted that I was in the hands of a master filmmaker.	[Jauja features] some gorgeously observed tableaus but also stretches of dry tedium, hemmed in by a layered and mannered aesthetic.	Alonso's films are as much about men moving through the landscape, leaving behind the rules of civilization to become lost in the wilderness.	At its most powerful, Jauja suggests the surreal Western violence of Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian in the way Alonso gradually folds the action into a waking nightmare.	For all its evocation of the 'classical' western, Jauja also, at moments, conjures a chilled-out Alejandro Jodorowsky -- less obviously surrealistic but no less provocative in its core propositions.	Jauja will prove haunting for those lured in by its deliberate pace and lovely visuals, though it may test some viewers' patience.
A movie in which the intelligence is supposed to be artificial, but it's the emotions that feel that way.	A really interesting and thought provoking story.	It turns out that Kubrick was right. The problems this story presented couldn't be solved after all.	You're encouraged to ponder complex questions while enjoying an amazing ride.	Involving and exasperating, stressing that the desired fusion of two spirits could, in this case at least, generate only friction.	A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism, A.I. is, in a word, fascinating.
A gorgeously photographed, sun-baked fable about a rural vendetta.	After a certain point, no one is right and no one is wrong, both sides have boundless grievances, and it's the audience that wants to run away with the circus.	There isn't a line that doesn't echo with heavy meaning or a character that has a life outside his or her dramatic purpose in this allegory.	A bleak, beautiful cinematic fable driven by the brutal logic of blood feuds and transformed by an overpowering sense of wonder.	Full of poetic imagery, dazzling photography and heartfelt performances from a mostly unknown cast.	Visually poetic, Behind the Sun is a powerful statement about cycles of violence.
Bailey and Barbato are, as always, master showmen, fixing their story in time with a rhinestone-flashing flair that's both vividly remembered and relentlessly motive.	It's funny, unnerving and sad.	A sharp documentary that has comedy, tragedy and, yes, a glimpse of Linda Lovelace's party trick.	...if you are an adventurous filmgoer and can stand the challenge of the controversy, you'll get an eye opener.	A history lesson that challenges many preconceptions.	A documentary on the film that brought smut mainstream, Inside Deep Throat is gaining praise as an entertaining look at a pop culture milestone. However, some critics say the film could have gone a little deeper into the people involved.
In a year when the franchise watchword is 'dark', this delivers the full noir with a side order of dementia.	Both in and out of the suit, Bale owns the role in a way none of the previous three Batmen did.	There has never yet been a Batman story with quite this kind of psychological trauma. If Ingmar Bergman had ever directed a superhero movie, it would have looked quite a bit like this.	Perhaps one of Batman Begins biggest joys is the casting against type of Gary Oldman [who] makes his piloting of the Batmobile one of the film's biggest rushes.	A part of a laudable trend to give comic-based movies a kind of cinematic upgrade -- using actors instead of stars, and giving the material to interesting directors.	Brooding and dark, but also exciting and smart, Batman Begins is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes.
Amarcord, easily one of Fellini's masterpieces, is at once a personal memory film and a more detached social scrutinization of Italian society, specifically the political isolation and cultural provincialism that helped Fascism rise to power.	...for long lasting imagery this nostalgic remembrance is highly entertaining and just may hook a newcomer to foreign film.	Fellini's ability to compose a frame that oozes baroque drama and vitality is almost unparalleled and Amarcord more or less succeeded for me in evoking a time period through the eyes of a young boy...	Fellini is so bountiful with incident and observation that he makes most other film makers seem stingy.	[S]imply nonsensical to me. Fascists are idiots, Catholic priests are clowns -- I agree with this. So why don't I feel it?	Ribald, sweet, and sentimental, Amarcord is a larger-than-life journey through a seaside village and its colorful citizens.
Ferociously stupid and often very funny.	Prepare to be dazzled, we are told in the first few minutes, as fireworks are lit in eager anticipation. But the fireworks fizzle big time, as does this tedious, tired comedy that is short on appeal and laughs. Wacky and low-brow it is, but fun it ain't	With a little help from his friends, [Samberg] has landed his jump with ease the first time on the ramp. Rod would love it. Hells yeah.	Aims to be goofily anarchic...but it's sloppily written, lazily staged and annoyingly dumb...like a home movie slapped together by a bunch of half-addled bar pals.	...just the sort of stuff an unapologetically idiotic comedy needs.	A few funny scenes can't save the disjointed Hot Rod, which is too silly and sloppy to hold up.
Those familiar with the era to which Reed aspires will sit through Down with Love enveloped by a feeling of fondness and affection.	The ensemble's comedic timing is impeccable.	Reed never quite decides if his film is an homage to the pre-ratings code ingenuity and fabulous '50s design of those films or a parody of their dated silliness.	Luscious, inventive, and always dreamy.	McGregor and Zellweger obviously relish playing these roles, and their gusto is infectious.	Looks great, but Zellweger and McGregor have no chemistry together, and the self-satisfied, knowing tone grates.
Tomboy is a lovely reminder that the French have long been famous for a quite different sort of film-about children.	There's a real feeling here for the doubts of the young and for the way an initial fib grows and grows.	A tender, sensitive French drama rich in hazy atmosphere.	'Tomboy' makes its points about gender identity and confusion without resorting to cheap laughs or overwrought drama.	"Tomboy" is tender and affectionate.	In tune with the emotion and tribulations of childhood, Tomboy is a charming movie that treats its main subject with warmth and heart.
Superbly directed, brillliantly written and featuring a terrific central performance from Brian Geraghty, this is a thoroughly engaging drama that packs a powerful emotional punch.	Geraghty renders a gutsy, extraordinary portrayal that fully reveals his potential as a sensitive, risk-taking actor with leading-man confidence.	An engaging and moving tale.	Not much seems to have changed in the world of urban heterosexuals since Hal Salwen's 1995 techno-prophetic classic Denise Calls Up.	For any film, let alone a debut, to address difficult subjects with this much insight, humor, and humanity is almost miraculous.	This promising debut from writer-director Kyle Patrick Alvarez is anchored by a startlingly honest and tender performance from Brian Geraghty that helps make Easier with Practice more than just another road trip drama.
A slapdash, gross-out good time if you're up for some rude 'Hangover'-style shenanigans to go with your heaping helpings of '80s nostalgia.	It's passably funny in spasms, but in the end the outright vulgarity palls and you wonder what the two leading ladies in the cast, Collette Wolfe and Lizzy Caplan, thought of it all. Not much, I'd say.	Hollywood nam ovim filmom pokazuje da, s vremena na vrijeme, zna stare ideje iskoristiti na svje i zabavan način	For the most part, this is a really goofy and fun piece of work, and Cusack hasn't been this good in years.	The nonsensical-as-Sarah Palin-quotes comedy zaps you straight to the mid-1980s, when cinematic orgies of pure hyperactive insanity such as Weird Science were not only possible but commonplace.	Its flagrantly silly script -- and immensely likable cast -- make up for most of its flaws.
A suburban sales executive reaches a dead-end and must re-evaluate his life while practicing the salutary art of letting go.	In the end, Everything Must Go is something of a consciously static study in sadness, both well-made and wearying.	It's a genuinely unexpected performance, one of those things that you never would have predicted, but once you see it you realize it's perfect.	This is a bittersweet, quietly powerful drama about a man at the end of his rope who must decide whether to start climbing or let go.	A gratifying story with a quietly powerful performance from funnyman Will Ferrell.	It may not improve on the Raymond Carver short story that inspired it, but Everything Must Go resists cliche and boasts a pair of magnetic performances from the perfectly cast Ferrell and Wallace.
A perfectly judged, strikingly beautiful film, but also a lunatic enterprise which invites - even welcomes - befuddlement as much as wonder. A true original.	A reminder that cinema can still challenge you, rather than just placate you.	Like Primer, Upstream Color will benefit from repeated viewings, from the ability to rewind, review, rethink. Dive in.	Upstream Color builds a stunning mosaic of lives overwhelmed by decisions outside their control, of people who don't understand the impulses that rule their lives.	If Upstream Color is not quite the masterpiece we were hoping for, it's a film with its own affectless mystery and chill.	As technically brilliant as it is narratively abstract, Upstream Color represents experimental American cinema at its finest -- and reaffirms Shane Carruth as a talent to watch.
German kickboxer-turned-director Lexi Alexander's brutal, unsparing portrait of disaffected youth running rampant amid the football stands and terraces of jolly old England.	A colossal misstep at every turn; the sort of film bound to appeal more to one who knows not a thing about football and the UK than one with even the slightest knowledge.	Unfortunately, the beatings are often more interesting than what's caused them.	A well-intentioned but ultimately calamitous attempt to analyse the so-called 'English disease.'	At its best, the movie navigates an intriguing moral tightrope between the fetishization of bloodshed and the outright condemnation of it.	When it comes to the subculture of soccer thugs, Green Street Hooligans lacks sufficient insight, and instead comes off as a Fight Club knock-off.
Talk To Her manages to be female-centric even as it explores the lives of men.	Sad and beautiful, sly and funny, clever and controversial.	Almodovar uses the characters' unlikely predicaments to show how we define ourselves by narration, but his story is so overdetermined that ultimately the two men seem as constrained as their brain-dead sweethearts.	Humanity is intricate, contradictory, fathomless here, and the filmmaking just as rich.	This is a complex, beautiful film that is, in the end, more warming than chilling, one that people will be talking about for a long time to come.	Another masterful, compassionate work from Pedro Almodovar.
City of Ghosts doesn't quite work, but it has its moments, and some of them just may be worth the price of admission.	Despite setting a nicely taut and tense mood throughout this psychological thriller, Dillon ultimately fails with the story.	can be criticised of many things, but wasting locations and local talent is not one of them	Dillon's film musters gobs of atmosphere and touristy menace without attending much to story or character.	There is so much to admire in Matt Dillon's City of Ghosts that the feeling left over after watching it is an unsettling sense of disappointment and unfairness.	Atmospheric, but that's about it.
Corajoso em sua abordagem narrativa, Bergman cria um dos mais densos dramas psicolзgicos do Cinema, quebrando as convenушes da linguagem para expressar idжias e sentimentos.	Persona probes the depths of the human psyche, even as it examines the ways in which people tell stories and create new realities. Its themes are timeless, and it still holds up today.	Not a movie, but a Film. And a Great Film it is. As good as any.	Ingmar Bergman's most actively astonishing film.	One is forced to spend much more time in examining these women than in getting to understand them. They are treated as objects not subjects -- an attitude which, whether intentionally or not, is relevant to contemporary corruption.	Arguably Bergman's finest film, Persona explores the human condition with intense curiosity, immense technical skill, and beguiling warmth.
I was torn watching this film. You feel Brando's pain, and yet it is the fundament of all those great performances.	A first-rate, first-person dissection of his life by the talented, charming and oft-troubled actor, Brando.	It's a pleasure to watch, serving up Brando as a model for other artists who aspire to sincerity and honesty in their work.	The film is unique in that it is all Brando all the time, so we get to spend a couple of hours (and a lifetime) with the man.	The man who emerged as a robust but sensitive star in the 1950s offers much frank introspection, some of it no doubt inspired by the late-life family tragedies with which Riley bookends his film.	Listen to Me Marlon offers a fascinating look at the inner life of a Hollywood icon, told in his own words.
It is the best courtroom melodrama this old judge has ever seen.	Otto Preminger, no stranger to ruffling moral-watchdog feathers, never succumbs to the sleaziness inherent in the material, instead turning out an intelligent and tightly controlled drama that ranks as one of the all-time great courtroom procedurals.	To me Remick's damaged, dysfunctional presence is the really subversive thing about the picture. And Stewart's grandstanding attorney propels this long film to its final verdict.	The strengths of the film are too numerous to mention. The story is fascinating, the script well constructed, and the performances fabulous.	At 160 minutes, Anatomy is longer than the subject warrants, but the pace seldom slackens -- thanks to the competence of Director Otto Preminger.	One of cinema's greatest courtroom dramas, Anatomy of a Murder is tense, thought-provoking, and brilliantly acted, with great performances from James Stewart and George C. Scott.
One of the great rock 'n' roll documentaries. Val Kilmer is astounding.	It seems more the glorification of an alcoholic jerk than a cautionary tale.	The film is an absurdity -- muddled, self-serious, alienating, a stone drag.	The whole movie is white hot, lapped in honeyed golds, evilly blue and black or drenched in those swoony, fiery reds. The Doors blasts your ears and scorches your eyes.	Much of the movie is ridiculous: Stone has never known restraint. But it's also enjoyable in a jittery, hyperbolic way, and parts of it are undeniably moving.	Val Kilmer delivers a powerhouse performance as one of rock's most incendiary figures, but unfortunately, Oliver Stone is unable to shed much light on the circus surrounding the star.
The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is director John Ford's most famous epic drama - the classic adaptation of John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning, widely-read 1939 novel.	The Grapes of Wrath was often named the greatest American film, until it was dethroned by the re-release of Citizen Kane.	This brilliant film shows us a family of enormous dignity and commitment.	Like To Kill a Mockingbird, [it's] one of those rare motion pictures that perfectly captures the essence of its source material without compromising it in any way.	Captures the stark plainness of the migrants, stripped to a few possessions, left with innumerable relations and little hope.	A potent drama that is as socially important today as when it was made, The Grapes of Wrath is affecting, moving, and deservedly considered an American classic.
The whole plays better than that would suggest, largely due to Jackson's imagination and commanding skill.	Is there an iPhone App for the afterlife? If not, the celestial CGI that Peter Jackson deploys to cringe-worthy effect in The Lovely Bones could probably suffice.	Peter Jackson's adaptation of Alice Sebold's best-selling novel hovers just this side of Ghost Whisperer kitsch but remains compulsively watchable.	Rarely has a film launched by a killing seemed so insistently alive.	Misses the nuances and emotional hub of the bestselling novel by concentrating on the crime and psychedelic shots of heaven.	It's stuffed full of Peter Jackson's typically dazzling imagery, but The Lovely Bones suffers from abrupt shifts between horrific violence and cloying sentimentality.
A requiem not for Nader but for a time when politics wasn't a dirty word; for that reason it is required viewing for all citizens, concerned or no.	Eschewing narration or direct questioning, the directors instead employ a vast archive of consistently engaging clips from Nader's many congressional battles.	This fascinating documentary examines the issues raised by Nader's runs for the presidency...that shone a powerful light into our grubby political shadows, and also played a part...that twice put George W. Bush into the White House.	It does vividly capture the ambitious advocate as not just an outsider, but a stymied and stunned political pariah.	An entertaining tour of this endearing, infuriating absolutist's life and legacy.	A compelling documentary that humanizes the controversial, polarizing politician.
With the release of Stanley Kubrick's enigmatic space spectacle in 1968, the science-fiction film finally came of age.	I assumed that this was what all movies ought to be: treasures for moral and aesthetic contemplation that did not provide all their answers on first contact.	Pure unadulterated sci-fi and there's nothing like it and probably never will be again.	2001 lingers on the mind like a tall, black riddle: Where are the new bones, the new tools, that will take us higher? Do we even deserve them?	brilliantly conceived	One of the most influential of all sci-fi films -- and one of the most controversial -- Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity -- and folly -- of mankind.
Succeeds in capturing a personality with all its infuriating and inspiring facets.	It's a well-told, well-mounted movie, though not one that challenges the standard diagnosis of the creative personality.	Conveying all the artist's rage, ego and madness, [Harris's] Pollock packs a wallop.	Harris does a brilliant job playing the tortured, uncommunicative painter.	a plodding glimpse of the latter part of Jackson Pollock's life	Though Pollock does not really allow audiences a glimpse of the painter as a person, it does powerfully depict the creative process. Harris throws himself into the role and turns in a compelling performance.
Poor Amanda Seyfried. One of today's most lively and expressive young actresses, she finds herself stuck between two lifeless pieces of wood.	Mixes the melodrama of Twilight with the hokey horror of The Village but falls short of being 'so bad its good.' It's just not good.	Not as awesomely awful as Twilight, though director Hardwicke dwells in the same overwrought, teenage fever-dream, while her cast embraces the campiness as if knowing they've signed up for a giant blot on their CVs.	Have you had questions about the motivations of the wolf, or suspicions about Grandma? Have you pondered the sexual connotations of this age-old fairy tale? Me neither. Just the same, someone has made a movie about...	With this film and the first "Twilight," Hardwicke has shown that she doesn't have much talent for direction and that she isn't that good a judge of material if this is the kind of film she keeps choosing.	Amanda Seyfried is magnetic in Red Riding Hood's starring role, but she's let down by her uninspired leading men and a painfully cliched script.
I liked this one because of its young performers, the evocative island setting (filmed in Rhode Island), Alexandre Desplat's lovely score and Robert Yeoman's slightly grainy cinematography.	Anderson never loses his core themes - young love, the need to escape, the bind and bluster of family. His "Kingdom" may not be large, but it is perfectly appointed.	It's a fable about what it feels like to be 12 years old and afflicted, from head to toe, by a romantic crush the size of a planet.	Intermittently amusing, distinctive, not always easy to digest	Magical Moonrise a Romantic Delight.	Warm, whimsical, and poignant, the immaculately framed and beautifully acted Moonrise Kingdom presents writer/director Wes Anderson at his idiosyncratic best.
Presents a sickening chorus of accounts not just of rape but of institutional betrayal, of a system that's utterly failed to protect or serve those who've joined it.	If this enrages you, it should.	A disquieting investigative essential documentary that sheds light on the massive problem of rape and the systemic cover-ups in the US military.	The Invisible War is a crushing indictment of a system that is way off the rails.	The film delivers a sledgehammer blow to the audience, with an experience every bit as shattering and overwhelming as one might infer from the subject matter.	The Invisible War is a vital and frank expose on sexual assault in the U.S. military, shot by master filmmaker Kirby Dick (This Film is Not Yet Rated).
An emotional triumph.	...the movie is, on the whole, just not that interesting.	Bahman Ghobadi's third film presents a harsh account of war, displacement and deprivation that is saved from utter bleakness by a tough, earthy lyricism.	The perpetual motion only temporarily staves off a pervading, self-evident despair.	Whatever your feelings about the war in Iraq, it's impossible to not be moved by the displaced, maimed and killed children left in the conflict's wake.	Set in Iraq after the fall of Saddam, Turtles Can Fly is being hailed as extraordinary, moving, and lyrical.
Araki's discovered a mellower mood, and who'da thunk it? Silence suits him.	Delicately balances the sordid and rough with the childlike and fantastic...	Reveals the pain and suffering wrought by sex offenders who prey upon children.	Sweet and disturbing at the same time.	The audience has gotten the point roughly 90 minutes before the characters do.	Bold performances and sensitive, spot-on direction make watching this difficult tale of trauma and abuse a thought-provoking, resonant experience.
Whoosh!! Days of Thunder just streaked in, fast as a race-car paint job and about as flat.	Days of Thunder wants to be an action drama, but it's really just a star vehicle of the most rudimentary sort, with nothing to offer Cruise except a chance to look pretty and chant time-tested punchlines.	The plot is like a comfortable old pair of blue jeans. It may not be very challenging, but you can feel right at home with it.	The racing sequences lack the adrenaline-inducing thrills of Maverick and Goose's antics, but the chemistry between Kidman and Cruise is heady.	Like the previous Simpson-Bruckheimer pictures, it's designed to give audiences an overdose of the thrill of victory; it wants us to jump out of our seats, pumping our fists in the air and roaring for the hero to pulverize his opponents.	Days of Thunder has Tom Cruise and plenty of flash going for it, but they aren't enough to compensate for the stock plot, two-dimensional characters, and poorly written dialogue.
May not be a breakthrough in filmmaking, but it is unwavering and arresting.	For those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s, the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed.	A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy.	Scores by marshaling facts that speak for themselves. And they don't speak kindly.	Um retrato fundamental do homem que certamente deve ser uma espécie de 'mentor espiritual e intelectual' de genocidas como Rumsfeld, Rice e cia..	This compelling unauthorized biography takes a muckraker's view of the controversial diplomat.
A conjurer's trick that delights for about an hour, then spirals into idiocy.	Fun but make few demands on moviegoers.	'The major twists and turns are relentlessly predictable and register as sharply as being poked by a stick of margarine. The Recruit needs to undergo some more training from the Hollywood creativity department.'	The Recruit is serviceable spy fodder made a great guilty pleasure by Pacino's 'OK, no Oscar here, let's have some fun' performance.	Roger Donaldson's The Recruit represents the cool, jaded spy flick our dissatisfied generation needs today. And that's a good thing.	This polished thriller is engaging until it takes one twist too many into the predictable.
Despite the grievous mood integral to telling the story of the McCourt family, Angela's Ashes never descends to a level of complete despondency.	Larded with folksy humor and patronizing empathy.	There is something so compelling, so forceful and even so humourous about McCourt's life journey that the film lifts us out of the Limerick gloom it depicts.	A dreary, ultimately punishing adaptation of Frank McCourt's memoir, where every other scene has somebody either getting sick, puking or dying.	Admirably performed.	In spite of its attempts to accurately record Frank McCourt's memoirs, the onscreen adaptation fails to capture any of the drama or humor of his life.
A sometimes plodding but often vibrant look at the fall and rise of Walt Disney Pictures	The contrast between these more candid moments and those of the polished professionals is evocative, reminding us that this is a story about how the development within a corporation affects the individuals inside.	Waking Sleeping Beauty will matter only to those who grew up on Walt Disney's animated films. In other words, all of us.	Instead, it's a fascinating look at how a group of talented, flawed individuals managed to pull together for a while and make some beautiful and lasting films. There's something kind of magical about that, too.	Essentially a Jeffrey Katzenberg take-down piece, Don Hahn's fragmented documentary about the massive changes at Disney Studios between 1984 and 1994 doesn't dare go near touchy subjects like Disney's blood-draining takeover of Manhattan's Times Square.	It doesn't probe as deep -- or tell as many hard truths -- as it could have, but Don Hahn's look at Disney's rebirth offers a fascinating and surprisingly candorous glimpse into the studio's past.
A disgusting account of what the evil Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans stands at the center of this Oscar-laden weepie about macho buddies from a small industrial town.	[It dwarfs] almost any other film that deals with the ugly reality of war.	Overlong, but with moments of greatness.	The film's depiction of a senseless war remains relevant as long as power-hungry leaders continue to play Russian roulette with the lives of young soldiers.	Michael Cimino's Oscar-winning epic The Deer Hunter brought the emotional, homefront legacy of the Vietnam War vividly to life for audiences around the world.	Its greatness is blunted by its length and one-sided point of view, but the film's weaknesses are overpowered by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken.
The deeply affecting situation is explored with lyrical artistry, touching drama and remarkable performances in Away From Her, the impressive directorial debut of Canadian actor Sarah Polley.	Even if the rest of the film was a complete dog, ,i>Away From Her would be worthwhile simply because it gives Julie Christie so much screen time.	The whole film grows on you. Polley's trademark as an actress is that she gives nothing away at first; you have to watch an entire movie to know everything she's thinking and feeling. Away From Her unfolds with that kind of restraint.	Sarah Polley's sad, wise and simply dazzling directorial effort beams with warmth.	It's a gorgeous acting job from Christie, striking those moods of frustration, depression, and infirmed calm so vividly.	An accomplished directorial debut by Sarah Polley, Away From Her is a touching exploration of the effects of Alzheimer's, in which the tender wisdom of Polley's script is beautifully complemented by a wonderful performance from Julie Christie.
The acting is extraordinary.	Its accomplishments are astounding, as are its flaws, but even its shortcomings are worn as proudly as scars from a bloody street battle.	Gangs Of New York is a magnificent film, and is challengingly about more than the sum of its' parts.	Une fresque impressionnante par moments, qu'il faut voir pour le début et la fin, en pardonnant Scorsese pour le centre.	Brilliant but devastating. High schoolers and up.	Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance.
A clever, complex, and poignant success is as astonishing as it is satisfying.	What's remarkable about 12 Monkeys is that, despite its decade-hopping abandon, the film makes a chilling kind of narrative sense.	One of the qualities that makes 12 Monkeys so good is the fact that it is almost too complicated to explain.	Constantly surprising and consistently unsettling.	12 Monkeys seems to go down smoothly without compromising anything or dumbing itself down.	The plot's a bit of a jumble, but excellent performances and mind-blowing plot twists make 12 Monkeys a kooky, effective experience.
Powerhouse performances by Chris Cooper and Laura Linney highlight this taut political thriller.	After the lumbering self-importance of The Good Shepherd, this lean, self-effacing portrait of an organizational black sheep is welcome.	It's stunning how much drama Breach is able to evoke with only a few, angry words.	...suspenseful and calculating. As a stimulating thriller padded with cynical mind games, Breach flourishes with its vivid dosage of prestige and paranoia.	A compelling piece of fictional journalism, blending real elements and storytelling with a rare finesse.	Powered by Chris Cooper's masterful performance, Breach is a tense and engaging portrayal of the FBI's infamous turncoat.
We remember the quiet, empty passages, the sun rising across the desert, the intricate lines traced by the wind in the sand.	A movie with scope, tremendous clarity of vision and purpose; simply put, it is a film for the ages, an epic in every sense.	Released in 1962, it was pretty clearly the most intelligent spectacular within living memory. On its 40th anniversary, it's even better.	If ever there was a movie worthy of restoration and reissuing it is Lawrence of Arabia.	A very good film.	The epic of all epics, Lawrence of Arabia cements director David Lean's status in the filmmaking pantheon with nearly four hours of grand scope, brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography.
Kapur cunningly confuses gender roles, equates sex with death, and rattles through dark, stony passions with some considerable panache.	Not only makes the traditionally stuffy and aloof British costume drama accessible, but entertaining and exciting as well.	Blanchett is the shining jewel in an otherwise dull and tarnished crown.	Drama of the ascendancy of England's most powerful queen brims with great acting, brilliant direction.	This is the best film ever made about the subject of a British ruler.	No mere historical drama, Elizabeth is a rich, suspenseful journey into the heart of British Royal politics, and features a typically outstanding performance from Cate Blanchett.
But I'm a Cheerleader may seem too elementary to a sophisticated crowd	Too often she substitutes petulance for the curiosity and determination the role requires.	Dumb, heavy-handed satire.	Crushingly obvious and abysmally unfunny.	It's the year's funniest, most absurd sight gag.	Critics think that But I'm a Cheerleader could have been better. The acting is stiff at times and the plot is surprisingly unoriginal.
Michel Gondry's introverted and untethered whimsy becomes oppressive, and very quickly boring. ... 'The Science of Sleep' drifts away into woozy inconsequence.	With Science, [Gondry] conjures up some of the most surreal visual images you'll see in a movie this year.	An exceedingly fanciful film that's both more provocative and less successful than the Carrey piece.	The film is wonderfully innovative.	A whimsical, irrepressibly creative and playfully childlike confection.	Lovely and diffuse, Sleep isn't as immediately absorbing as Gondry's previous work, but its messy beauty is its own reward.
[S]et[s] back the noble causes of blasphemy, rational thinking, and humanism about a century... doesn't even have the nerve to be profane...	This is Jack Black and Michael Cera doing Jack Black and Michael Cera, the problem is that that was funny about three years ago and now it's just kind of predictable and boring.	The problem is not the historicity, or lack thereof, in a comedy, but the uneven pace of the humor.	It's a bit flabby and careless, but it's also gleefully stupid, and it has the ability to knock you off guard and make you giggle helplessly.	Mostly Year One moves along ploddingly, stepping frequently into bathroom humor and never quite funny enough to justify its high concept; when it's over, it quickly slips away.	Year One is a poorly executed, slapdash comedy in which the talent both in front of and behind the camera never seem to be on the same page.
Click to read the article.	As zany movies go, this one goes whole hog.	The story should be enjoyable for anyone in a wide range of ages.	Though the filmmakers romanticize farm life, they don't sugarcoat the realities.	The characters (both animal and human) are solidly conceived, and the storytelling and visuals are expertly fashioned.	The rare family-friendly feature with a heart as big as its special effects budget, Babe offers timeless entertainment for viewers of all ages.
Diamonds Are Forever doesn't carry the same quality or flair as its many predecessors.	The worst of the Connery Bond films.	Thanks to the clarity and cut of past 007 films, Sean Connery will sparkle forever. But with a dearth of action and only a fat paycheck as motivation, "Diamonds" feels less like a triumphant return and more like a cheesed-up cabaret version of Bond.	Big, silly and essential Bond.	This film is as over-the-top as they come.	Diamonds are Forever is a largely derivative affair, but it's still pretty entertaining nonetheless, thanks to great stunts, witty dialogue, and the presence of Sean Connery.
Boasts two bravura performances--from Newman, who finally -- and deservedly -- won an Oscar for Best Actor, and Cruise, who is a joy to behold. Watch for Forest Whittaker and Iggy Pop in colorful bit roles.	Pic has a distinctive pulse of its own with exceptional performances by Paul Newman and Tom Cruise.	A joy to see two masters (Scorsese and Newman) at ease with their work, and one, Cruise, in the making.	Word is that Paul Newman gave Iggy Pop the cold shoulder during the filming.	For the bulk of the run time, The Color of Money excels on its intended terms as a sexy genre picture, mostly thanks to an energetic star turn courtesy of Tom Cruise.	That it's inferior to the original goes without saying, but Paul Newman and Tom Cruise are a joy to watch, and Martin Scorsese's direction is typically superb.
Both a history lesson on the birth and death of an American city and a portrait of people who refuse to give up on a dream. It is also a grass-roots ecological tract made up of equal parts science, folklore and kitschy nostalgia.	It makes for a strange, but somewhat endearing, melange of the grim and comic.	If Metzler and Springer were on path to becoming environmentalists and their documentary was their thesis, they'd get an A.	If it's not likely to send you scurrying off to the place on your next vacation, it's still a fascinating, nutty story, a kind of Chinatown gone wrong (or gone more wrong ).	Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea is an engaging, entertaining snapshot of a long, tragicomic moment in American history.	Plagues And Pleasures is a thoroughly engrossing account, both humorous and disheartening, of a once bustling community ravaged by ecological change and human greed.
I was certainly happy to be trapped in the film's conceit, and the directors, Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, manage to convince us that we have witnessed an action movie, although in fact the quantity of violence is so minimal.	The movie's engine is the relationships and the characters' inner lives, all of it boiling with emotional intensity.	[Infernal Affairs] isn't a good guy versus bad guy film but one that shows good and bad, both, in the makeup of the players.	The twists offered in Infernal Affairs ... take the genre to enthralling new heights, guaranteeing that any future such efforts will have an entirely new bar for which to aim.	It's refreshing enough to make up for its occasional missteps in the storytelling department.	Smart and engrossing, this is one of Hong Kong's better cop thrillers.
Aspires to the whimsy and fantasy of The Wizard of Oz but doesn't really capture the magic… more a fond tribute to 'pure imagination' than a triumph of it.	Anyone who doesn't like the Oompa-Loompa song simply isn't human.	A polarizing, but classic piece of children's entertainment filled with whimsy, horror, comedy and imagination.	With a single gleam of his eye, Wilder pulls off more hints at a devious personality than all Johnny Depp's white make up, and bad wigs combined.	The passages in the mysterious factory, which should be Charlie's and our release from the oppression of the earlier scenes, are just as ugly as everything that's come before, so there's no contrast.	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don't always work but express the film's uniqueness.
Along the way, a powerful spectacle unfolds with serious class and feminist implications.	Too cold and cynical to be truly enjoyed but the old dog still has a few new tricks up his sleeve.	One's final impression is that aging legends make unreliable puppet-masters. And that it's all too easy for a desirable young actress to be left dangling in mid-air.	A Girl Cut in Two is a spry piece of work. Chabrol uses this sinister clown show as a means to puncture the media world's hot-air balloons -- as well as to highlight the hypocrisies of his favorite target, the haute bourgeoisie.	A Girl Cut in Two is a rich, textured divertissement from Claude Chabrol, a sinister master of the art.	Nouvelle Vague master Claude Chabrol balances subtle stabs of humor and biting class criticism to explore a love story and the seedier side of the haute bourgeois.
Frenetic and forced	It plays like a cross between Home Alone and The Breakfast Club. Pre-teens are sure to have a great time, and accompanying adults will, too.	Cycles of escape, recapture and punishment ensue, though a climactic infusion of Christmas spirit helps keep results merry.	The PG rating for Unaccompanied Minors doesn't stand for Pretty Good.	A ragged but extremely amiable family comedy.	Unaccompanied Minors, while featuring credible performances by its mostly young cast, is simply a rehash of other, funnier movies.
The film captures New York in all of its media-lashed uproar, [and] Paris in the spring has rarely looked so heart-swellingly gorgeous. But the most impressive natural wonder in the film is Meryl Streep [in] one of her most wickedly inspired comic perform	Killer cast, killer clothes, killer laughs. And best of all, you don't have to know the difference between Donna Karan and Donna Summer to delight in the film's wicked workplace politics.	A fun, entertaining date movie.	Streep's comic timing is so on-the-mark that she even manages to get a sizable laugh with the simplest line imaginable: 'Go.'	The Devil Wears Prada is to the cutthroat world of chic glossies what Swimming With Sharks is to the movie business: a satirical indictment of its industry, with naive lackeys serving as the spectator's surrogates through the glitzy abyss.	A rare film that surpasses the quality of its source novel, this Devil is a witty expose of New York's fashion scene, with Meryl Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own.
The transitional gears never grind. They just keep clicking until you know you're along for the entire ride.	The black American offers a brief, sharp bit of tragicomic business that only appears unrelated to Nino's dire plot. He has no idea who he is, and even when he finds out, he's committed to silence.	Strange, entertaining and disquieting.	Nothing quite prepares you for the unique experience of this film. It's an offer that you ... well, you know. Leave the gun, take the cannolis. Mangiate bene.	Try to connect the movie's two parts: the spry comedy and the deadly serious piece of Mafia business	Mafioso begins as an amusing farce and skillfully transforms into a portentous social drama.
Intelligent and affecting as the film is, it buckles under the weight of overexplicitness, a tendency to say more than it needs to.	What saves My Life Without Me from the status of a five-Kleenex weepie is the maturity of vision that permeates the writing and direction and shines through each performance.	My Life Without Me is a young person's movie about death, the sort of adolescent daydream in which you imagine your own demise.	A movie that is spare, candid and beautiful in every detail.	a warm, melting analysis of life through the cold eye of death.	Sarah Polley keeps this production afloat with her moving performance.
Breathlessly details the step-by-step evolution of an enigmatic musical artist within pop culture from the 1960s on to the avant-garde, though little about the man.	Scott Walker: 30 Century Man chronicles the career of musician Scott Walker, an enigmatic figure whose influence far outreaches his relative obscurity.	For Walker fans, I imagine 30 Century Man will come as a bit of a vindication, having the knowledge that they knew this world before it had been fully documented and made ready for public consumption	Scott Walker: 30 Century Man glosses over the depression and alcoholism that have bedeviled Walker as well as any relationships he might have had. But that doesn't make the film any less interesting.	Like the best music documentaries, Scott Walker: 30 Century Man blends grace and mystery. It should delight longtime Walker fans and introduce him to new ones.	Scott Walker: 30 Century Man is a stylish portrait of an influential artist that will fascinate fans and neophytes alike.
Flags has the guts to put honest quote remarks around 'the good war" and 'the greatest generation.' It honors the fathers and the lost sons by not simply raising a flag.	Marks Eastwood's continuing march to prove he's a modern John Ford.	War is hell, heroism is subjective, and seemingly insignificant events are exploited for the benefit of the power elite. Who knew?	The clichés undermine the power of the story.	There's a tremendous amount of material here, and the script covers too much of it, often confusingly.	Flags of Our Fathers is both a fascinating look at heroism, both earned and manufactured, and a well-filmed salute to the men who fought at the battle of Iwo Jima.
Although it doubtless will find more success in the DVD market, on the big screen Devil makes for bland viewing.	Devil is nothing very special or original, but it gets the job done briskly and economically.	At best a cheesy, unsatisfying thriller and, at worst, a waste of time.	It's not a great film. But it held my interest throughout and released me at just the right time. (Parental Review also Available)	This office building had so many employees. Not just the people renting office space, but a security staff, cleaning crew and maintenance. How are we having an economic crisis when there are so many jobs available in every skyscraper?	It's better than many of the other films M. Night Shyamalan has been associated with, but Devil never gets more than a few low-budget thrills out of its fiendishly promising premise.
Despite the snags, De Palma remains a virtuoso puppet-master, pulling the strings taut in a nail-biting robbery sequence, switching from micro to macro with Hitchcockian panache, and finally letting rip with a hell-for-leather climax.	A fun and diverting summer movie, well worth the price of admission.	Starts with a whimper... and, you guessed it... self-destructs.	I was riveted.	Knows enough about style that it's absorbing to watch even when nothing much is going on.	Full of special effects, Brian DePalma's update of Mission: Impossible has a lot of sweeping spectacle, but the plot is sometimes convoluted.
The "innocent man" notion has been copied and recopied for decades, but few have the minerals to stand with this one.	As an artist, Alfred Hitchcock surpassed this early achievement many times in his career, but for sheer entertainment value it still stands in the forefront of his work.	The 39 Steps was the first time everything just came together: the master's favorite themes, his sense of humor, his timing and rhythm, and his personal touch. With this movie, he emerged, fully formed.	All the fun of North By Northwest in a little over half the time, The 39 Steps is -- even for the umpteenth viewing -- absolutely unmissable.	Far more substance than other thrillers.	Packed with twists and turns, this essential early Alfred Hitchcock feature hints at the dazzling heights he'd reach later in his career.
Cedar, who was born in New York and now lives in Israel, has a mission of his own: to show the folly of war. He succeeds, even if the claustrophobic filming sometimes makes viewers feel as closed in as the Israeli troops.	Adapting his spare, intense, award-winning film from the novel by Israeli TV programmer Ron Leshem, Joseph Cedar has created a movie of tremendous power -- nerve-racking, astute, and neutral enough to apply to all soldiers, in all wars, everywhere.	Although there's muted criticism here of military strategy, script endeavors to maintain a politically neutral stance, sticking to the ground soldiers' points of view, rendered convincingly here by cast and third-time helmer Joseph Cedar.	Cedar... prefers to let his expansive set and hard-boiled characters tell the story from a ground level rather than implying a commentary... It's as if a weight were lifted, and the 132-minute film moves like a breeze.	Announces to North American audiences a major new talent in the form of 39-year-old writer-director Joseph Cedar.	Beaufort is a deeply observant and meditative war film, masterfully rendered by director Joseph Cedar.
They compensate for the inevitable decline in shock potential by tripling the overall velocity. Hot damn, does this thing ever move.	[REC] 2 smartly picks up right where the first one left off, and takes little time to reestablish momentum.	The sequel only adds further gimmicks to the already gimmicky haunted house formula of the original.	In our hearts we didn't expect [REC] 2 to be quite as good, but we really didn't expect a baggy, vaguely comic action romp which plays like a first-person-shoot-'em-up based on The Exorcist.	The film is entirely composed of helmet-cam and video-camera footage. It's formally interesting and pretty effective.	It lacks the surprising jolt of the first installment, but [REC] 2 almost maintains the original's chilling momentum -- and proves not all horror sequels were made equal.
Dalton is just a little TOO serious as Bond.	The stunts all look convincing, and the effect of the closing sequence is exhilarating.	Dalton plays a straight-faced, humorless, no-nonsense Bond -- all guns and no play -- and it makes for a very dull time.	This series' record of maintaining an admirable level of quality stays intact, even if this film might best be used as a cinematic appetizer to see before renting a tape of one of the Connery or Moore classics.	The thrills-and-spills chases are superbly orchestrated as pic spins at breakneck speed through its South Florida and Central American locations.	License to Kill is a sharp action picture -- it's darker than many of the other entries, with Timothy Dalton playing Bond with intensity -- but it still has some solid chases and fight scenes.
The film is suffused with his anguish over the state of our species, and our planet. Yet it ends with a change of heart and a turn of events that make a plausible case for hope.	Wenders, hoping to illuminate not just these images but the man who made them, has found an intriguing way to capture both Salgado and his work simultaneously.	Despite lacking any nods towards Salgado's artistic influences, The Salt of the Earth leaves you both traumatised and tantalised; his work can be difficult to take in at times, but there is no doubt you're left wanting more.	... a picture of the brutal life of survival in the worlds far beyond our shores...disasters, international conflicts, starvation, and exodus, even showing the Zo'é tribe hunting in the uncharted rainforest...a mesmerizing film not to be missed.	In a sense this is another Wenders road movie, only it spans an entire life and winds up in locations even more far-flung than usual.	While the work it honors may pose thorny ethical questions that Salt of the Earth neglects to answer, it remains a shattering, thought-provoking testament to Sebastiăo Salgado's career.
The truth lurking beneath My Kid Could Paint That is that your kid couldn't paint that.	Raises compelling questions about artistic 'authenticity,' the 'meaning' of modern art, the voracious and double-edged demands of the news media, the exploitation of children and the nature of faith itself.	Bar-Lev handles [the portrayal of the Marla hype machine] sensitively and with a minimum of contrivances. He examines his role, but avoids excessive self-reference.	My Kid Could Paint That is a welcome return to ambiguity in the documentary, while posing perhaps the year's most intriguing mystery.	My Kid Could Paint That is a fascinating portrait, as much about media manipulation, the art establishment and parenting as it is about a little girl who happens to like to paint.	Director Amir Bar-Lev grapples with exposing the authenticity of four-year-old Marla's paintings at the sake of burdening her publicly shamed family to transfixing results.
It's worth seeing simply to make the acquaintance of Tobias, a really extraordinary old guy.	Once the shock factor of [Tobias] having once eaten another human is over, the movie doesn't have much more to offer.	There's no denying the warmth of Schneebaum's encounters, or his engaging nature. Or the fact that you've never seen a documentary quite like this one, and aren't likely to again.	As [Schneebaum] explains the male-male relationships and the absence of stigma or judgment, the film soars.	A fascinating if somewhat unfocused documentary.	Keep the River on Your Right places the spotlight on a fascinating individual, Tobias Schneebaum.
Hanson and his three leading ladies have given us the gift of a finely crafted movie full of humbling and humorous truths.	The movie works neither as a comedy nor as a lame melodrama -- its entertainment value is embarrassingly feeble.	You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love every minute.	Very well written. All the supporting performances are good.	You can see that some of the stuff on the screen might have actually worked in print, especially for a certain audience. But so much more is gooey and lazy and just not especially smart.	Honesty and solid performances make In Her Shoes a solid fit for all audiences.
Transporter 3 is so bad it's good, and it knows it.	Makes good on its formula with no pretensions.	I had less problems with the characters and more trouble with the actual action, which felt really antiseptic to me.	All that inane chatter from Valentina detracts horribly from what is supposed to be going on in a Transporter movie -- mayhem.	A 'what not to do' guide when making an action film.	This middling installment in the Transporter franchise is a few steps down from its predecessors, featuring generic stunts and a lack of energy.
Talk to Me is an incisive portrait of a provocative figure. It comes very close to caricature, but remains human and lively.	constructs such a complete image of proud and passionate radio host Ralph Waldo "Petey" Greene that we immediately understand why the deep flaws in his personality could only have led to his downfall.	For all the wild controversy that Petey ignited in his time, Talk to Me ends up being as generic and watered-down as its title.	Poignant and often very funny, Cheadle deserves a clutch of prizes come awards season.	Alternates too deliberately between jaunty comedy and serious message-making.	A riveting look at the life of legendary DJ "Petey" Greene, Talk to Me goes beyond the typical biopic with explosive performances from Don Cheadle and Chiwetal Ejiofor.
It's worth seeing as a reasonably crafted suspense film, but a month from now I will barely remember it,	Despite the presence of all these action-flick cliches, In the Line of Fire works. Sure, it's no more than a formula movie, but it's an effective formula movie.	Directing each set-piece for all he's worth, Petersen highlights the plot with vivid details and invests several of the action sequences with moral/psychological dimensions.	Smooth and effortlessly entertaining political thriller. Eastwood & Malkovich deliver great work.	Eerie assassin and protector are perfectly balanced in this classy entertainment.	A straightforward thriller of the highest order, In the Line of Fire benefits from Wolfgang Peterson's taut direction and charismatic performances from Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich.
It's liable to get people hopping mad, whether or not they buy Paine's overarching conspiracy theory.	A spirited celebration of the deceased can honor the lost opportunity even as it challenges the living, breathing, concerned survivors to demand more from corporations, government, ourselves.	Like An Inconvenient Truth and Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, the movie is ultimately a nonpartisan warning.	The specifics create a sit-up-and-take-notice aura of doom that pervades the narrative much like Al Gore's impending disaster doc.	... an entertaining but sometimes disingenuous documentary ...	A searing indictment of big business and greed, Who Killed The Electric Car? is a well-tuned doc that simultaneously entertains and enrages.
Another magical experience that will have the mother's crying and the kids cheering!	With its colorful circus setting and quirky characters, this short Disney movie is easy to like, but it's Dumbo himself who steals your heart.	Dumbo was for Disney what The Old Man and the Sea was for Hemingway: a simple but powerful story that's brilliantly rendered and succeeds precisely because it is so simple, archetypal, and true.	Disney classic will still make you cry!	Small wonder Walt Disney often pointed to 'Dumbo' as his personal favorite in the Disney pantheon.	Dumbo packs plenty of story into its brief runtime, along with all the warm animation and wonderful music you'd expect from a Disney classic.
The movie is one giant, family-friendly folk-art fiesta, and more that, really, than a saga whose ins and outs wildly captivate or make us care.	While it's a tad busy and overloaded at first, it all pays off so nicely that I appreciate the total package.	Though the plot gets a bit congested, the film remains far less predictable than most of its kind.	Not even duff songs can mar The Book Of Life's rich design, sterling performances and cheering loser-done-good plot.	It's the film's colorful and detailed look that will be etched in the minds of many a viewer long after seeing the flick. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available)	The Book of Life's gorgeous animation is a treat, but it's a pity that its story lacks the same level of craft and detail that its thrilling visuals provide.
John Carpenter's apocalyptic thriller has aged remarkably well; its vision of Manhattan as a giant maximum security prison anticipates better-known dystopias like Blade Runner and Brazil.	The genius of John Carpenter includes his subtlety in composition. The man has always known that the best special effects are invisible and never detract from the story.	It's a rare film that has so many ideas and yet fails so consistently to make use of them.	Great B-movie fun.	The movie proudly wears its affection for crusty Sergio Leone archetypes and countdown-clock suspense sequences; Carpenter was Tarantino long before Tarantino was.	Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, Escape from New York is a strange, entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness.
A charming delight.	A charming entertainment.	Splendid MGM Lerner and Lowe musical classic in all areas: stars, music, and overall production.	One of the last great musicals to be written especially for the screen.	With so many outstanding performances in the film, it is to Maurice Chevalier's great credit that he is able to steal the show.	It may not be one of Vincente Minnelli's best, but the charming and flawlessly acted Gigi still offers enough visual and musical treats to satisfy.
Surprisingly poignant and unflinchingly honest.	Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.	What makes writer-director Lukas Moodysson's work head and shoulders above similarly-themed movies is the sheer unaffectedness of it.	High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?	Moodysson's story may be an old one -- the taboo romance between lovers from different ends of the school spectrum -- but his sharp script refreshes old themes.	A naturalistic depiction of teenage life, Show Me Love has a charming, authentic feel.
Batman was no longer torn from the pages of a funny book, but peeled off the bottom of a pair of Dr. Martens.	Batman Returns, though, is full of grim, Dostoyevskian undertones, not to mention a multitude of bloody, violent scenes.	It's the kind of film which has great stills but never quite comes alive when it actually moves -- likely to win at the box-office quicker than it does in the mind.	Comes closer than ever to Bob Kane's dark, original strip, which began in 1939.	Burton, once an animator at Disney, understands that to go deeper, you must fly higher, to liberation from plot into poetry. Here he's done it. This Batman soars.	Director Tim Burton's dark, brooding atmosphere, Michael Keaton's work as the tormented hero, and the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as, well, Christopher Walken make the sequel better than the first.
Moreau's nuanced turn as the title character ensures that the film is not a complete loss. She's very convincing, especially when there arise some questions regarding her mental stability.	Moreau's marvellous performance captures the vulnerabilities of a woman who never dares to dream that her work might be taken seriously and who seemed to spend a lifetime poised between the call of greatness and the threat of madness.	The film's complex portrait of Seraphine -- who is alternately angry, bewildered, funny, belligerent and tender -- feels as fresh and alive as her work still does.	Séraphine is a rare example of a film that does justice to the mysteriousness of artistic invention.	A naive, between-the-wars French painter is brought to vivid life in the satisfying fact-inspired drama Seraphine.	Seraphine is a well-crafted French film that effectively captures one woman's experience with art, religion, and mental illness, and features a brilliant performance from Yolande Moreau.
Formulaic, manipulative, hokey — and thoroughly rousing… the film's sincerity and poignance have a way of steamrolling over gaps in plausibility and logic.	A great underdog story, and you gotta love the flying crane.	A warm-heartened riff on the tried-and-true Rocky formula, and one of the better cinematic icons of the 1980s.	'80s classic is still fun for families with older tweens.	A surprise summer hit in the States, this is another film-making-by-numbers exercise in teenage wish-fulfilment.	Utterly predictable and wholly of its time, but warm, sincere, and difficult to resist, due in large part to Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio's relaxed chemistry.
Guest's satire of small-town America and amateur actors has a sly edge, it's not mean, and Guest never strips his characters of their dignity.	It's Corky's movie.	A very funny, very unusual ensemble comedy that falls somewhere between slapdash and brilliant, an improvised comedy with more hits than misses.	It keeps you laughing from beginning to end.	An ode to the hopes and dreams of every performer and a send-up of every bad performance around.	This riotously deadpan mockumentary about aspiring community theater performers never stoops to ridicule oft-ridiculous characters.
. Presumably slapped together in a whirlwind of utter indifference while Besson was otherwise preoccupied, "Colombiana" is a bitter bon-bon of a film that even the most dedicated members of his cult will find difficult to swallow.	We all love a steamy pile of frivolous nonsense now and then, but it has to move quickly or we lose interest, like a joke that stops being funny.	Saldana has star quality and action chops but the script is laughable and boring.	Columbiana is stupid, listless and too shy to be any fun. When you fail to make a well-armed, underwear-clad Zoe Saldana interesting, it seems almost intentional.	After opening weekend, 'Colombiana' will more than likely be buried in the shallow grave of other femme fatale action duds like 'Aeon Flux,' 'Catwoman' and 'Elektra.'	Zoe Saldana has the chops but she's taken out by erratic and sloppy filmmaking.
There's no substitute for bad taste. And this one has it double-barreled, both in the timing of its release and as a movie, one said to be loosely based on fact.	Inhumane? Yep. Sadistic? Sure. But it works where countless others of the genre have failed, by introducing people we get to know and care about before all hell breaks loose.	It is almost as if a hardcore survival horror film had been infiltrated (and slyly undermined) by the quieter mysticism of Peter Weir's Picnic At Hanging Rock...	Made with the intention to scare moviegoers silly, and it succeeds.	Despite the obvious influences of the original "Chainsaw," "Hills Have Eyes," "Last House," and other kidnap-terror films, you can't predict what is going to happen in this film.	Though Wolf Creek is effectively horrific, it is still tasteless exploitation.
For those of us old enough, it is another magical reminder of how these missions gave us some hope in very challenging times. For those of us too young, this will give you an idea of what it meant to watch those baby steps that led to one giant leap.	When it comes to the Apollo program, nobody relates the saga of men going to the moon quite like the corps of 24 who actually made the trip.	This magnificent documentary about the Apollo missions to the moon contains oodles of original, beautifully remastered NASA footage that has never been seen before.	It's a satisfying and heartening reminder of what a glorious thing a small group of men once contrived to do.	A fascinating, funny and moving documentary -- possibly the best screen exploration ever of the Apollo program.	Director David Sington poetically interwove 20th Century's cosmonautic history with its effect on the public's view of their country, their heroes and their future.
It tells a simple story -- an almost archetypal story -- but it does so with a lot of passion and technical sophistication.	Not even the incoherent mishmash of plot...can entirely dim the appeal of this match-up between a blue-eyed Punjabi and a blue-eyed Mexican of almost equal comeliness.	Basu strictly observes the B-movie convention of giving the audience an embrace, explosion, or chase sequence at regular intervals. If you don't like the genre, wait three minutes.	Kites is an aromatic, cinematic Indian mutton stew -- if that sounds different from usual movie fare, it is. It's a Bollywood mixture of romance, violence, action, music, and differing cultures and languages. Kites flutters and plummets.	Kites is, essentially, a love story. With exploding cars.	Thoroughly overwrought in true Bollywood fashion, Kites is deeply flawed -- and too effervescently charming to resist.
It appealed enormously to its target audience because it's just the kind of violence kids would like to get away with if they had no consciences nor fear of adults at all.	Joe Dante's most successful film, like William Castle crossed with Looney Tunes.	An enchanting yet savagely funny movie, Gremlins belongs alongside Ghostbusters as an enduring mainstream masterpiece from the summer of 1984. Just don't watch it after midnight.	A comic horror movie classic.	See website for more details.	Whether you choose to see it as a statement on consumer culture or simply a special effects-heavy popcorn flick, Gremlins is a minor classic.
[Y]ou come away with the impression that it actually does make his father proud.	For those of us who haven't previously been witness to adult film star Ron Jeremy's, ahem, body of work, Scott J. Gill's Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy is a strangely fascinating experience.	Though sharp and funny, Porn Star is (ahem) not very penetrating.	A documentary portrait that is as sad as it is funny.	Though generally sympathetic, the film manages (without stooping to clichéd moralizing) to suggest that being Ron Jeremy isn't the non-stop paradise his fans imagine.	Porn Star is both an entertaining and poignant documentary on the life of Ron Jeremy.
Warm, funny and works as a musical, too.	Kids will probably enjoy the sight of huge, bumbling teddy bears... Parents will exit wondering why this piece of unnecessary cross-promotion wasn't released straight to video.	Unlike Kermit & Co., the Country Bears are completely devoid of charm.	Less Behind-the-Music than After School Special, The Country Bears is thoroughly embarrassing.	Don't tell anybody, but I'm going to buy the soundtrack to The Country Bears.	Despite all the celebrities on hand, this spin-off from a theme park attraction still feels tired and hokey.
Finally -- with barely a half-hour left to go, Donnie Yen does his thing.	Flash Point comes loaded with cliches and immediately starts blasting them in every direction.	There's nothing that I dislike about FLASH POINT, but I do wish it could be even more than it is	Yen has developed a recent passion for mixed martial arts, and his more traditional punches and flying kicks are supplemented by some close-quarters Muay Thai kicks and even some jujitsu submission holds. Ultimate Fighting Championship fans will be happy.	Insensible.	Flash Point features some nice mindless martial-arts action, but too much of the already thin story treads familiar ground.
Part slasher-movie spoof, part self-reflexive Theater of the Absurd.	The movie takes that old genre into such consistently thoughtful directions that I was constantly amused.	Either of the film's sides - the horror comedy or the post-modernist commentary - probably wouldn't be enough to sustain the movie on its own. But with both facets taken together, writer/director Quentin Dupieux can have his cake and deconstruct it too.	The greatest meta movie about a killer tire ever made.	An essay on storytelling and spectatorship within When Inanimate Objects Attack schlock -- one infused with the haunting aura and disillusionment of a post-Easy Rider road movie -- Rubber is some kind of miracle.	A clever premise gets plenty of comic blood and violence, but its hampered by some questionable storytelling techniques from director Quentin Dupieux.
An amazingly complex and yet strikingly affecting look at love, life and memory that gives us one of the great movie love stories ever told.	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind continues to come up with such amazing visuals, but its real trick is that it makes us care for Joel and Clementine.	With a few adjustments of plot and premise, Gondry and Kaufman might have made their masterpiece here.	As techno-wacky and surreal as the movie gets, what gives it a genuine, beating heart is Kaufman's insight about relationships.	Misery wants company.	Propelled by Charlie Kaufman's smart, imaginative script and Michel Gondry's equally daring directorial touch, Eternal Sunshine is a twisty yet heartfelt look at relationships and heartache.
A dramatically solid, if talky, account of the controversial episode in the post-war world that spawned the phrase "the banality of evil", with strong performances from Barbara Sukowa and Janet McTeer.	...actors in supporting roles telegraph the controversies surrounding Arendt's personality as if they were attempting to literally touch the viewer's nose.	Like A Hidden Method, David Cronenberg's drama about Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Hannah Arendt takes seriously the life of the mind.	Barbara Sukowa delivers a beautifully modulated performance, showing the rigor of Arendt's thought and convictions while revealing the contours of a passionate woman with complex relationships.	A crisply measured character study with plenty of intriguing ideas, elevated by a terrific, finely calibrated performance by Sukowa.	Led by a powerful performance from Barbara Sukowa, Hannah Arendt does a commendable job of dramatizing the life of a complex public figure.
The use of Craven's name in the title is a cheesy marketing ploy and the secret to the fanged suitor's aversion to all things Christian is an even cheesier hoot.	This bloodsucker is, well, kinda sucky.	Bargain basement horror.	Director Patrick Lussier has a keen eye for color and knows how to compose a great-looking shot; unfortunately, Lussier also co-wrote and edited the film, effectively undermining his talent.	Just what we need: another Dracula movie!	This retelling trys to offer a different spin on the origin of Dracula. Unfortunately, there's nothing here audiences haven't seen before.
[A] clunky, fraudulent, yet apparently crowd-pleasing laugh-and-tear-jerker.	Directed and co-written by first-timer Jon Avnet, the episodic production manages to capture the fried-tomato flavor of the deep South without becoming too pushy or patronizing about it.	The script plods. Tandy looks as though she'd rather be elsewhere. The desire is understandable.	Fried Green Tomatoes is a case of a film acted with such skill and conviction that glaring problems of narrative, pace and structure seem like minor slips.	After all, it's not every day that one encounters a sensitive tale of sisterhood that also contains an element of cannibalism. For that alone, the movie deserves respect.	Fried Green Tomatoes' tearjerking drama is undeniably manipulative, but in the hands of a skilled cast that includes Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates, it's also powerfully effective.
Take the Lead is one of those inspiring teachers in the 'hood tales. And it's 'inspired by a true story,' which translated means 'as Hollywood cornball as humanly possible.'	A bogus, trumped-up 'inspirational' ending goes on forever and all but ruins everything.	The dance remains the same...Take the Lead has exactly two things going for it (each worth one star): the always entertaining Antonio Banderas and a lot of ballroom dancing.	Think of it as the fictionalized version of last year's engaging documentary Mad Hot Ballroom, with teen dancers and sexier moves. It is also more formulaic and clichéd, thanks to the predictable plot and theme.	The poster says 'Never follow', while the movie itslef follows every cliche in the book.	Banderas is charismatic in the lead, and the dance sequences are captivating, but the story is too familiar and predictable.
Few American debuts in recent years have announced a talent as singular as that of Behn Zeitlin, the blazingly gifted director and co-writer of Beasts of the Southern Wild.	A stunning debut that finds its dandelion-haired heroine fighting rising tides and fantastic creatures in a mythic battle against modernity.	All of the unique elements here never add up to a cohesive or satisfying whole.	An ambitious love letter to a Louisiana way of life that's being literally washed away.	It hews to no aesthetic or political party line. It is simply life, seen through the kaleidoscope eyes of a brave, imaginative child.	Beasts of the Southern Wild is a fantastical, emotionally powerful journey and a strong case of filmmaking that values imagination over money.
Handsomely shot and with a likable lead in Kuno Becker, it also suffers from a script so outrageously generic you could buy it at Costco.	This isn't just a great soccer movie; it's a great movie, period.	No points for originality, but Goal! scores three valuable stars for its warmth and wit.	Utterly predictable from the first frame, but nevertheless, a real crowd pleaser.	It is constructed of sports movie clichés but built on an unshakable foundation of earnestness.	Impressive sports action sequences are the highlight, as the run-of the-mill story invokes every known sports movie cliche.
Watching it is vaguely like watching someone explain how to play poker when you have never played it and in fact have no intention of ever playing it.	Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie keeps the kid-friendly spirit of the show while raising the stakes enough to justify a serviceable big-screen treatment.	A treat for the fervent young fans who remain, and a true test of devotion for their accompanying parents, who may need all the help they can get figuring out the storyline.	With the possible exception of ESPN-televised poker, watching somebody else play a card game is incredibly boring.	Yu-Gi-Oh! will make you go ugh!	Don't watch the TV show or play the card game? Then this movie is not for you.
Whatever the director asks of Cruz she delivers with poise and sincerity. It's easily her finest work, and one of the year's best performances.	Almodóvar's phantasms are emotionally anchored so the story never gets away from its characters -- just when you suspect he might have overplayed his hand he stages a clever, surprising inversion to tie the film together.	[A] vibrant film that's pure class, pure imagination and pure Almodovar.	Almodovar is back! Not that he ever actually left....	Volver admittedly remains a rather slight work, neither as flashy nor as wildly unpredictable as his past few films, preferring instead a quieter elegance and more intimate tone than Almodóvar's more elastic marvels of screenwriting architecture.	Volver catches director Pedro Almodovar and star Penelope Cruz at the peak of their respective powers, in service of a layered, thought-provoking film. This magical tragicomic melodrama may be Almodovar's most restrained work to date, but it still features his trademarks: a strong attention to color and detail, a celebration of the trials and tribulations of women, and, of course, the inestimable Carmen Maura. The lovely Penelope Cruz hasn't shone more brightly as she does here.
There isn't a single thing this movie attempts that every episode of Louie doesn't do better.	However, there's something ultimately unsatisfying about the experience of listening to stand-up comedian Mike Birbiglia tell the true story of his inability to marry his longtime girlfriend (played by the far-too-hot-to-be-with-him Lauren Ambrose).	Sleepwalk With Me is a disposably sweet 'Annie Hall' rehash that achieves its minor ambitions with unremarkable efficiency.	It all adds up to a fine, funny exercise in disheveled self-deprecation: a self-portrait of a guy who can't control a major portion of his life.	Mike Birbiglia's wonderfully deft "opening up" of his stand-up routine is a rare achievement in this genre and a supremely self-deprecating delight.	Laugh-out-loud funny and endearingly messy, Sleepwalk with Me overcomes its tonal inconsistencies to deliver a sweetly melancholic, amiably reassuring indie crowd-pleaser.
An affectionate look back at those heady days.	A dazzlingly crafted documentary.	The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture, the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative (and sometimes illegal) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults.	Dogtown and Z-Boys does precisely what a documentary movie should do: it makes its subject fascinating whether you actually give a damn or not.	Does a terrific job of evoking the electric magic of an extraordinary era.	Dogtown and Z-Boys is a colorful, exhilarating look at the skateboarding subculture.
It may be too happy and sweet for the cynical crowd, sort of a "have a nice day" movie, but if feel good films are your fancy it would be hard to go wrong with this one.	Hanks' film is about how all good things come to an end. The important thing is to enjoy it all while it lasts.	In the end, the movie simply clicks. It is a class act all the way.	Hanks or no Hanks this gem of a movie is definitely worth the time.	Rock on, Hanks.	A light, sweet, and thoroughly entertaining debut for director Tom Hanks, That Thing You Do! makes up in charm what it lacks in complexity.
Sci-fi fans expecting awesome effects and an interesting vision of the future are bound to be disappointed.	Gives up too early in its search to say something authentic.	A likable movie.	It's a step in the right direction for both its star and maker.	Bicentennial Man too mushy, heavy-handed.	Bicentennial Man is ruined by a bad script and ends up being dull and mawkish.
A kind of second cousin to Paolo Sorrentino's "Il Divo" (2008), "Bronson" shares that film's mechanical sense of ambivalent regard for its subject'	If you want to spend two hours with a psychopath who loves nothing more than getting naked and brawling with prison guards, this is for you. I prefer vintage Kurosawa.	An example of a film that is, in all likelihood, considerably more intelligent and interesting than its subject.	Bronson is one of those "based on a true story" dramatizations where the theatrically staged drama only gets in the way of the more interesting truth.	The kernel of an idea -- brutish antihero as irrepressible life force -- is trampled into dust by the showy Sturm und Drang of Refn's filmmaking.	Undeniably gripping, Bronson forces the viewer to make some hard decisions about where the line between art and exploitation lies.
Plays like a Three Stooges travelogue.	Solid family entertainment that alternates plenty of laughs with plenty of adventure.	A dead-on-arrival movie idea.	Despite all the audience-pleasing laughs and derring-do, it fails to take us anywhere we haven't been before.	A peppy, fast-moving, wafer-thin amusement that's fine for kids if you don't mind a lot of Three Stooges-style martial arts. For grown-ups, it's the equivalent of a 59-cent tin globe.	Hit-and-miss family fare that bares only the slightest resemblance to Verne's novel.
The helmer's subtle work with his excellent cast and Chris Menges' widescreen vistas of merciless West Texas landscapes help to temper the story's excesses.	Gives us little information about Pete and Mequiades, but plenty about the loathsome border patrol guy.	It attempts to cover a lot of territory just like the American border patrol in Texas, but its results are mixed, perhaps, not unlike the border patrol.	[A] long, kooky, immensely absorbing picture, which forges the elegiac cruelty of a Cormac McCarthy novel with the two-fisted machismo of a Sam Peckinpah movie, and comes up with an altogether new brand of Western mythology.	Tommy Lee Jones' stirring and deeply felt Three Burials proves one thing: Sometimes the most compelling films are the ones closest to the heart.	Tommy Lee Jones' directorial debut is both a potent western and a powerful morality tale.
"ParaNorman" is never less than entertaining, but you'll have to follow it into a strange purgatory between two opposing genres.	Paranorman has a unique look that's equal parts old school and cutting edge.	Unlike the polished universe of Pixar's "Brave" or countless other recent CGI efforts, "ParaNorman" maintains a delicate, handcrafted look that underscores its ideas.	One of the most original films of the year.	An entertaining and visually attractive family-friendly story.	Beautifully animated and solidly scripted, ParaNorman will entertain (and frighten) older children while providing surprisingly thoughtful fare for their parents.
Visually stunning, rich in detail, and filled with outstanding performances.	A obviedade da meia hora final compromete o impacto do filme - que, ainda assim, impressiona por sua escala жpica, por suas elegantes transiушes de tempo e зtimas atuaушes.	As one would expect from Leone, the film is a brilliant stylistic accomplishment.	Sergio Leone's cut is wonderful! Avoid the butchered theatrical version unleashed in the U.S.--I actually walked out on that indecipherable mess.	Great scene follows great scene with inventive direction for almost four hours.	Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting, and filled with great performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and James Woods.
Ali Larter is a fine performer and all, but when she's the big celebrity guest star of a movie, you know there's desperation in the air.	Opens with a horrific traffic accident, which seems apt since what follows is the cinematic equivalent of rubbernecking.	Even more than Part 1, the real stars of this movie are the elegantly choreographed freak accidents.	Decent at best this is a lighter, campier, but gorier sequel to the original.	Just a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs.	This sequel is little more than an excuse to stage elaborate, gory scenes of characters getting killed off.
Taken as a pair, the first two films ask a number of unresolved and unresolvable questions about causality, order, and intention; and taken as a pair, they're also a hell of a lot of fun.	The latest must-see, peer pressure, carve the logo on your head, designer blue jean experience.	Glum, claustrophobic and often oppressive.	The film ultimately relies on too many cheesy make-up routines in which characters play their older (and female!) selves which makes it not exactly the best movie in this series.	The film works best through its magnificent technical achievements (the visual effects received an Oscar nomination) and the inherent charm of Fox, Lloyd and, especially, the delightfully menacing Thomas F. Wilson.	Back to the Future II is far more uneven than its predecessor, but its madcap highs outweigh the occasionally cluttered machinations of an overstuffed plot.
A good story told with energy and efficiency.	This sounds like prime fodder for a fast-paced thriller, but the movie is actually something more special: a tender-hearted rumination on the loss of innocence among children.	A lyrical throwback to such movies as René Clément's Forbidden Games (1952) and other works of the humanist European cinema of a half century ago.	This is a different sort of horror film, where the known is infinitely more frightening than the unknown.	A visually magnificent film in which the camera will help you remember just how the world looks to children.	A well-acted and thrilling coming-of-age tale that captures a child awakening to the frightening world of adults.
It's crippled by a complete lack of chemistry between the two leads.	Sandler's worst effort to date.	Mr. Deeds is, as comedy goes, very silly -- and in the best way.	Nothing about this movie works.	What's surprising about Mr. Deeds, a remake of Capra's Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), is that it tries to be as earnest as its predecessor.	This update of Capra doesn't hold a candle to the original, and even on its own merits, Mr. Deeds is still indifferently acted and stale.
By turns tender and shocking, Iraq in Fragments strikes a rare balance between impromptu fluidity and feature-film narrative control, in the process resisting both partisanship and predigested points of view.	Visually arresting and deeply disheartening, James Longley's impressionistic documentary explores the pain of a shattered country by homing in on a few tiny shards.	James Longley's Sundance-winning documentary puts the camera uncomfortably close to scenes of abuse, violence, terror, cynicism and racial hatred amid the rubble of U.S.-occupied Iraq. But at the same time, its texture is frequently beautiful.	There are embedded journalists in Iraq, and then there is "Iraq in Fragments" director James Longley.	A documentary of stunning immediacy and marvelous images...	A stylistically bold, humanist take on the difficulties of post-invasion Iraq.
Visually fantastic, logically flawed and incredibly dull. Just like your friend's dreams.	Kon marries visual dazzle to unblinking pop existentialism in ways that make viewers' heads hurt so good.	This one jacks you into cyberspace, involving you psychically and physically.	Paprika offers a breathtakingly surreal journey. It's a film that may serve up mass destruction and ponder some nightmarish scenarios, but underneath it has a warm humanity and humor that's utterly endearing.	With a conventional invade-dreams/bend-reality plot, it's a bit of a bore.	Following its own brand of logic, Paprika is an eye-opening mind trip that is difficult to follow but never fails to dazzle.
A fish-out-of-water story with a bit of a freshness issue.	Always fully aware it need not involve big words or ideas to offer light entertaining fare even if there's only so far you can take such a predictable premise.	It doesn't pretend to be an awards contender, and yet, oddly enough this year, it's far more entertaining and astutely written than the majority of recent releases that are.	You see, city folk are like this, and country folk are like that.	It's as if the film is a no-humour zone, and any attempt at a laugh gets sucked into a cinematic vacuum of mirthlessness.	It gets a certain amount of mileage out of the inherent likability of its stars, but with an unfunny script and a lack of onscreen chemistry, Did You Hear About the Morgans? falls flat.
Psychological horror ensues, and how. I'd hate to reveal a single teardrop in this sharp chamber drama. It's all chill, no pill. The sun shines bright behind that vale of tears.	this dual character study, featuring a balls out performance from Moss and an eerie one from Waterston feels like so many other movies, everything from "3 Women"...to "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," yet defies coming into its own focus.	Well made, written, acted and crafted, it's the sort of movie that doesn't go down easy, takes no prisoners and leaves you hoping your own life will never resemble theirs.	[Perry's] gracefully disturbing execution conveys a tangible sense of the emotional violence and attrition that can underlie seemingly placid social surfaces...	Writer-director Alex Ross Perry conjures such a strong atmosphere around his characters -- and Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston are so powerful in the leads --that one gets sucked into their emotional conflict.	Led by a searing performance from Elisabeth Moss, Queen of Earth is a demanding -- and ultimately rewarding -- addition to writer-director Alex Ross Perry's impressive filmography.
Method Man ... proves to be a likable performer as he tosses off and wanders through How High's gags.	Totally witless.	Mark this one down as a matinee for fans of Method Man & Redman or of weed itself.	Either you find this stuff funny or you don't. I don't.	Aims low but smacks the funny bone considerably more often than it misses.	How High is a sloppily constructed stoner movie filled with lame, vulgar jokes.
Imagine Absolutely Fabulous without Edina and Patsy, or Dynasty without Alexis, and what have you got? The Informers.	Gregor Jordan's pointless adaptation of a Bret Easton Ellis book is successful only in the sense that it accurately mimics the emptiness of its subject.	We may not care about these cokeheads, but only rarely does Jordan fall into knee-jerk retribution.	The dialogue is laughable. Lines are spoken so languidly that the actors seem bored. Shattering revelations are delivered in the same monotone as casual patter.	Just because your characters are vacuous, less-than-zero types, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tone and structure of your movie has to adopt the same conditions.	As miserable and insipid as its protagonists, The Informers fails to provide anything to think about after the sheen of fake blond is gone.
Sidney Poitier is a beleaguered English teacher in this multi-cultural Mr. Chips	Even the weak moments are saved by Poitier, who invests his role with a subtle warmth.	The film has gone in and out of fashion, but it's old enough now to return to it with a clear eye, and see the strength beneath the kooky sentimentality.	It beat Dead Poets Society to the punch by over two decades.	Sidney Poitier stars in an excellent performance.	While it's a bit dated and overly schmaltzy, To Sir, With Love remains compelling because of Sidney Poitier's outstanding performance -- and the catchy theme song is a classic.
The quick cuts, swooping aerial shots, and images of wet T-shirt contests don't change what this is - a bunch of self indulgent 20-year-olds massaging their egos on camera.	Although filmed in Cancun, it might as well take place in the less appealing regions of the Jersey shore, as the camerawork is so dingy and the entire production lacks the appealing gloss of The Real World as it appears on MTV.	If you're a fan of reality shows you'll probably enjoy this movie. But do you really want to pay $10 to see something that you can watch on TV for free?	It's not quite the end of civilization as we know it, but it's not a good sign.	If you let yourself be immersed in its irrelevance, it actually has some enticing moments, which to some moviegoers might be the nipple-pierced twins' incestuous striptease.	The footage is predictable and rather tame, and most of the people are uninteresting.
Piper Perabo, who already used The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle to prove she can't act, solidifies it here.	Makes self-debasement in pursuit of self-fulfillment not just legitimate but fun.	Does Jerry Bruckheimer have the same nagging feeling of deja vu as he compares each new screenplay to those that have gone before?	Coyote Ugly 's main flaw is that it just isn't bad enough.	With all of its contrivances, clichés, and preponderance, Coyote Ugly might have well been taking place on Mars.	Well, the women in this film are incredibly attractive and flaunt that fact quite a lot. Unfortunatly, that's all there is to the film. The script is almost as big a joke as the charactors, and everything else follows the same path. If you're looking for a tease then see this flick, otherwise stay as far away as possible.
After 'Superbad' and 'Knocked Up', Judd Apatow has now pulled off the movie equivalent of the Triple Crown.	Very funny when focused on being a parody, but goes for the cheap laughs and shock jokes too often	This is a glorious tribute to the Shape-Shifter, a film that captures all the clichés of the musical biopic, then rises above them.	fantastic fun	The only gale-force laughter in later scenes comes when the hero meets the Beatles.	A parody that pokes fun at rock stars and reductive biopics alike, this comedy sings in large part because of stellar performances and clever original music.
Brings extraordinary honesty and keen emotional pitch to the family drama.	Zellweger and especially Streep both bring their roles to vivid life with a multi-dimensional blend of warmth, vulnerability, and underlying strength.	Thanks to Carl Franklin's clever direction, which always stays real close to the characters, what could have been a TV movie-of-the-week becomes a thought-provoking and touching film.	Sensitively written, fluidly directed and expertly acted!	Probably won't appeal to teens.	Solid performances lift this drama to a higher level.
As a salvo in the culture wars, Dukes of Hazzard is a dud, and as an actual movie it doesn't rate much higher.	Simpson recites her lines as though English were a language with which she is completely unfamiliar	It all backfires worse than the General Lee before a tune-up by Cooter.	Anyone who doesn't love the Dukes and their repetitive adventures won't find much of interest, and anyone who does is better off watching old episodes on CMT.	The Dukes of Hazzard is the latest evidence that, for Hollywood studios at least, there can never be too much of a mediocre thing.	A dumb, goofy, and vacuous adaptation of a TV show where plot is simply an excuse to string together the car chases.
Glorious romantic comedy.	Essentially a by-the-numbers Hollywood romance in the dopiest melodramatic tradition.	Sorkin starts his West Wing warm-up with a winning political rom-com.	Douglas and Bening are both wonderful.	A potentially good adult romance is undone by a preachy left-wing agenda.	A charming romantic comedy with political bite, Rob Reiner's American President features strong lead performances and some poignant observations of politics and media in the 1990s.
Alone In The Dark isn't going to set the world on fire, but it largely succeeds with what it has to work with. Just don't take it seriously and you'll have a fun time.	Alone in the Dark is amateurish at best and asinine at worst.	Trying to rehash this plot is like trying to describe a Jackson Pollock painting while drunk	As an audience-participation midnight movie, Alone in the Dark has potential.	Boll's vague X-Files rip-off isn't scary or exciting, but inadvertently he's made a movie funnier than a lot of the purported comedies Hollywood cranks out.	Inept on almost every level, Alone in the Dark may not work as a thriller, but it's good for some head-slapping, incredulous laughter.
The extraordinary athleticism and skills of these teenagers, all prime prospects for eventual NBA stardom, makes this a game you really want to see.	This is just a dull promotional video.	Although much of its archive footage from high school games shows up blurry, pixleated or in an otherwise raw form, it nonetheless clarifies the abilities of thoroughly committed young players executing their most impressive basketball skills.	Gunnin' for That #1 Spot is an on-the-fly record of a memorable moment in basketball history.	After the gimmicky audience-shot concert film "Awesome ... ," Beastie Boy Adam Yauch proves he can make a comprehensive, state-of-the-art docu of interest to basketball aficionados.	Beastie Boy Adam Yauch proves his worth as a director with Gunnin' for That #1 Spot, a fun-filled chronicle of the top high school hoopsters of 2006.
This 148-minute movie is best appreciated if you have already watched the first two movies or read the books. It is not intended to be a standalone film. Neophytes will find themselves lost and confused without sufficient background to fully appreciate...	Note to self: when masterminding evil conspiracy with connections to high government offices, store incriminating documents on a laptop without a wireless modem.	Unlike its two predecessors, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest boasts a briskly-paced opening half hour that proves effective at immediately drawing the viewer into the movie...	While Rapace remains a strong and captivating actress in the title role, the film is remarkably bad. In fact, it's easily one of the year's worst movies. Boring beyond belief.	I said hurrah for the books; I repeat it for the movies. And most of all, I say hurrah to Larsson for the extraordinary scope of his accomplishment and legacy.	Slow and mostly devoid of the stellar chemistry between its two leads, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is a disappointingly uneven conclusion to the Millennium trilogy.
William Blake may have once stated "The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom" but I'm guessing that if he ever had the opportunity to see the "Crank" films, he might have had second thoughts about that.	The constant escalation to [the filmmakers'] inventive insanity is so breathtaking, it's like a slap in the face to the tired hacks who make the glossy hidebound junk that passes for an action movie these days.	It's a hyperactive, relentlessly violent and po-faced mean S.O.B. - and I guarantee you'll 3/4 every minute.	The chaotic onslaught of gruesomely violent and graphically sexual exploitation is so ugly and ceaseless this time that it eventually numbs, and then bores, the viewer.	This Crank sequel fails to live up to the original in every way and that one didn't exactly set a high bar to begin with.	Crank: High Voltage delivers on its promises: a fast-paced, exciting thrill ride that doesn't take itself too seriously.
From the moment the arrest begins, the film is blunt and stunning, a completely absorbing, protracted nightmare.	A runaway powerhouse film packed with emotionally-gripping performances, outstanding direction and a script that challenges viewers like few other films have this year.	Michael B. Jordan portrays Oscar Grant as a complex and real person, making Fruitvale Station more than just the story of a death. In fact, it's one full of life.	At a time when the multiplexes are crowded with coarse comedy and inept spectacle, here's a homegrown movie that honors its subject and the medium.	Many will respond to the film as a gut-level human interest piece, but it's as curtailed and nuance-free a character study as it is a political polemic.	Passionate and powerfully acted, Fruitvale Station serves as a celebration of life, a condemnation of death, and a triumph for star Michael B. Jordan.
Whitaker's portrayal illustrates Amin's complexity -- a study on human nature, rather than an indictment.	The horror, when it finally moves to the centre of the screen, gives us Amin's barbarity in close-up -- and he's still smiling.	A shrewd commentary on misguided Western excursions into the 'dark continent.'	See the movie for Whitaker alone: He's possessed by evil and possesses it wholly, rendering the film (and everyone in it) his plaything.	Both an enthralling examination of a horrific time and an adrenalin-filled thriller full of wry humour.	Forest Whitaker's performance as real-life megalomaniac dictator Idi Amin powers this fictionalized political thriller, a blunt and brutal tale about power and corruption.
Better Luck Tomorrow breathes new life into a familiar story: coming of age in high school.	Perpetuates another stereotype: the one about affluent suburban teens who have everything they could ever want but so lack a moral compass that even murder seems like just another extracurricular activity.	Starts with the right intentions but quickly unravels.	A savvy, seductive and observationally vivid bit of popcorn culture that is every bit as brainy as its characters.	It doesn't offer audiences easy answers familiar to dozens of MTV-style teen comedies.	A promising work by Lin, the energetic Better Luck Tomorrow is disturbing and thought-provoking.
A decent film that's emotionally raw, worth seeing if only to see how one of the masters of her craft single-handedly manages to rescue (along with the help of her castmates) a film from being a maudlin mess into a watchable, moving piece of cinema.	Julianne Moore delivered the best performance by an actress in a leading role throughout the duration of 2014. Only Wild's Reese Witherspoon and Two Days, One Night's Marion Cotillard came close.	While it's no surprise that Moore is so good, "Still Alice" has an unexpected trick up its sleeve: the sweetly gentle performance of Kristen Stewart, as Alice's actress daughter Lydia.	While the relationship between Moore and Stewart's characters is interesting, most of the film follows well-traveled roads.	Losing your mind is a terrible thing to watch, but the splendid acting in "Still Alice" makes it worth the pain.	Elevated by a gripping performance from Julianne Moore, Still Alice is a heartfelt drama that honors its delicate themes with bravery and sensitivity.
[Both] a glorious celebration of the lunatic fringe (led by wild-child Doug Kenney) and a cautionary tale of the destructive impact of fame and fortune.	Douglas Tirola's celebration of the '70s comedy institution doesn't know when to put on the brakes. Nevertheless, its enthusiasm proves infectious.	Douglas Tirola's source material...is chock-a-block full of the magazine's oft controversial articles, art work and, most famously, the cover art	An ambitious attempt to follow how the various alumni and side projects of one scurrilous publication variously gave us Animal House, The Simpsons, Saturday Night Live and The Breakfast Club.	If only Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead was a fraction as intelligent or entertaining as its subject.	Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead might not be the definitive doc National Lampoon fans are waiting for, but it's still almost as transgressively funny as the magazine in its heyday.
Scent, fine acting, plus superb cinematography carry you through. However, you can't help but feel you've been cheated out of a truly devastating drama by folks in search of something more commercially palatable and, consequently, less plausible.	Loach's realism always carries a distinct sense of humor, volatility and, most alarmingly in this hypercapitalist new century, a socialist passion for The People.	The title, by the way, refers to the distillation process: the 2% of whisky that evaporates in the barrel is known as "the angel's share." I'm afraid there's more than 2% evaporation going on in Loach's latest.	With The Angels' Share, Ken Loach expertly combines a handful of genres which congeal into an often funny, always charming affair that serves as a salute to whisky to boot.	Newcomer Brannigan is a real find, though his dramatic weight is splendidly countered by the scene-stealing Maitland who provides one of the film's two unforgettable, can't-believe-he-did-that moments.	The Angels' Share is a surprisingly delightful, uplifting comedy that successfully blends a charming story of redemption with bits of dark humor and a social message.
Complex like its nation's own ethnic and cultural stew, this is bracing cinema even while its implications are distressing in the extreme.	Gripping modern-day drama about crime and tensions among the Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs.	As complex as Paul Haggis's film "Crash," this one may be confusing the first time around but affords the viewer an emotional picture of life in one of Israel's toughest neighborhoods.	Ajami has an appealingly rough-edged, authentic feel to it, thanks to some strong location work and the fact that the cast is drawn largely from non-professionals and real life locals.	Ajami isn't a downbeat film, though it is a relentless one. It is alive with energy, if only the energy devoted to survival.	This multi-character drama balances intimate portrayals and broad political implications to paint a bracing and moving portrait of the Middle East conflict.
a solid, suspense-filled 90 minutes	Quarantine director John Erick Dowdle and co-writing brother Drew wisely stick close to the told-from-the-cameraman's point-of-view template of the terrific original.	A respectable, if uninspired, adaptation of... [REC], a Blair Witch-style variation on zombie movie cliches that might seem fresher had it not opened after veteran George Romero's grimly pared-down Diary of the Dead.	I don't care how dedicated a TV journalist you are: when a rabid, shrieking hellion lunges for your neck, teeth a-gnashin', it's time to hit the standby button and defend yourself.	Underdeveloped and predictable, there is little compelling about the film other than the premise and a few of the kills.	Quarantine uses effective atmosphere and consistent scares to stand above the crop of recent horror films.
Austere and grimly realistic.	Debra Granik's bleak little film is as tough, unflinching and fascinating as the characters who eke out a life amid its cold, gray hills.	An extraordinary picture...a chilling portrait, but one with human warmth pulsating beneath the surface.	Granik... proves a dab hand with the camera, capturing the starkness of the Ozarks and Ree's situation in a free-flowing and pensive way that transfers the chill of it all on to the screen.	Serious, sensitive and stirring, it reveals a gritty, cruelly uncompromising world within the confines of our own country.	Bleak, haunting, and yet still somehow hopeful, Winter's Bone is writer-director Debra Granik's best work yet -- and it boasts an incredible, starmaking performance from Jennifer Lawrence.
Straightforward, brutal and exciting, a gripping tale of men ready for death in the face of unknowable treachery and a vicious enemy.	Some effectively staged action and decent turns ensure this is a solid addition to the growing canon of European-made Second World War films.	As directed by Ole Christian Madsen, the thriller features well-choreographed shootouts and assassinations. But the script is too melodramatic and complicated for its own good.	A satisfying thriller interestingly complicated by its study of character and compromise.	Throughout this compelling film, the assassins want to believe they're doing righteous work: they're fighting Nazi occupation forces, after all.	The true story of the Danish resistance in WW2, though lengthy and sprawling, is gripping and competently made.
A sickening, socially-irresponsible glorification of depraved and sadistic behavior...The worst film of 2005.	This is a perfect B-movie, full of wicked dread.	As the body count rises, The Devil's Rejects tries hard to stay funny and nasty, but the effort shows...	For the right audience, this movie is the butt-kicking, dirt-talking, blood-spurting equivalent of beautiful music.	Irredeemable trash, plain and simple, gratuitously violent and sadistic and aimed at people who derive entertainment from watching other human beings suffer.	Zombie has improved as a filmmaker since "House of 1000 Corpses" and will please fans of the genre, but beware -- the horror is nasty, relentless, and sadistic.
Depp's tight, guarded performance is almost painful to watch, and Newell seems to have reined in the flamboyant Pacino, whose portrait of the mobster as a grumpy old man may be his best work in years.	[Pacino's] turn as a low-level mobster is his most relaxed and charming work in years.	Donnie Brasco is a fine movie but it might just be best remembered as Johnny Depp's coming-out party. A star -- check that, an actor -- is born.	Pacino cans the showboating bluster and gives a gently nuanced portrait of a simple man in decline.	You get something far richer, if more unsettling, here than conventional crime drama's romanticism and easy analogies.	A stark, nuanced portrait of life in organized crime, bolstered by strong performances from Al Pacino and Johnny Depp.
Solid direction, ,thrilling set pieces, and an iconic performance from Glenn Close. It's a sleazy movie, but an extremely watchable one. The entertainment value for this one is very high.	[The film brings] horror home to a place where the grownup moviegoer actually lives.	Adultery-obsession thriller isn't for kids (or bunnies).	has the makings of a serious examination of adult relationships and interactions under duress, only to end as a seriocomic slasher film dictated by popular taste.	This movie is pretty stupid, really. I only felt for the rabbit.	A potboiler in the finest sense, Fatal Attraction is a sultry, juicy thriller that's hard to look away from once it gets going.
The prospect of a third installment of this derivative series is much scarier than anything that happens in the movie.	The movie's R rating mentions 'intense terror violence and gore,' but only its publicity team could consider it intense or terrifying. Gore it has.	A box office-driven sequel that re-hashes the already-tired approach and storyline of its predecessor.	. The door is left open for another sequel. I have an idea for it: a movie studio is about to greenlight yet another subpar teen slasher pic, but the fisherman comes in and hooks everyone before production can start. Sound good?	The only thing terrifying about this clunker is the thought of having to sit through it.	Boring, predictable, and bereft of thrills or chills, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is exactly the kind of rehash that gives horror sequels a bad name.
The movie is good for its minimal escapism, but little more.	Had there not been a Battlefield Earth I'd say this was the biggest turkey of the summer.	M:I-2 is just another summer stock item, like sunscreen and barbecue coals.	Old-fashioned entertainment liberally coated with flair, style and an explosion of action.	Woo outwits, outgadgets, outstunts and outdirects the original with one hand tied behind his back.	Your cranium may crave more substance, but your eyes will feast on the amazing action sequences.
I don't know about you, but the moment I hear the word lobbyist, my brain glazes over. Casino Jack and the United States of Money woke my brain, and my outrage, right up.	Offers a wide-ranging look at Abramoff's antics, from promoting sweatshops in Saipan to cheating Indian tribes out of casino revenues.	A lot of the film is rambling. Points aren't connected very well, and it feels needlessly convoluted. Worse, the tone seems completely inappropriate. If Gibney can't take the subject of human slavery -- in the Marianas islands -- seriously, how can we?	The narrative trots all over the globe, including stops for labor exploitation in the Marianas Islands, dealings with Russian mobsters,ripping off Indian tribes in the desert southwest, and jetting to Scotland to golf with impressionable politicians.	It should be required viewing for anyone who wants to vote in the 2010 election and has teabags stapled to their person.	Casino Jack's subject matter is enraging, but in the hands pf director Alex Gibney, it's also well-presented and briskly entertaining.
A movie so dumb it may actually cause brain damage.	These guys don't much about making movies, but they know how to stage a smack down.	A big, hilarious, stupid meathead of a movie, destined to be a huge hit on The Violence Channel.	The Marine often feels like an oddball black comedy about a dysfunctional band of sociopaths, just masquerading as an action movie about one tough ex-Marine.	What's a muscular guy like John Cena doing in a flabby movie like this?	Overblown in every possible way, The Marine is either so bad it's good or just really, really bad.
A sensitive, straightforward film that thankfully avoids sentimentality but nevertheless leaves a visceral impact on its viewers.	film portraiture of rare intelligence and subtlety	As raw and immediate as it is heartfelt.	Zonca shows an extraordinary ability to get into the female psyche.	At once an intriguing mix of naivete and world-weariness, Bouchez and Regnier make us care about two young women.	Showcasing excellent lead performances, The Dreamlife of Angels is an intelligent, absorbing character study of two women.
The best baseball film of all time.	Rightfully a ballgame classic, this is sentimental nonsense, sure, but charmingly so.	One of the best baseballmovies off all time	The sentimentality, of which there is plenty, is nicely balanced by a humor of ironic pragmatism, as when Ray, having built his baseball field as a monument to human dreams, decides to charge tourists $20 a head to visit it.	All of this would work better if Robinson built up the reality of the town more, made the citizens a more palpable presence, as Frank Capra did in Hollywood's greatest fable-fantasy, It's a Wonderful Life.	Field of Dreams is sentimental, but in the best way; it's a mix of fairy tale, baseball, and family togetherness.
By privileging the dynamics between the characters over story, Reichardt has created an extremely rewarding cinematic experience that is rich in political commentary, pathos and visual beauty.	[Rides] a thin line between the intangibly graceful and the merely frustrating in its rejection of narrativity.	The film, which clearly owes a debt to Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven, proceeds at a snail's pace.	We watch them trudge for miles, growing tired of listening to the squeaky wheel of a wagon.	Reichardt's boldness in eschewing a sprawling retelling of how the West was won should be applauded, but she hasn't yet earned the right to take this long saying so little.	Moving at a contemplative speed unseen in most westerns, Meek's Cutoff is an effective, intense journey of terror and survival in the untamed frontier.
In this era of torture porn and slasher pics, House of the Devil is a shining example of how to build atmosphere and tension the old-fashioned way.	Carefully, perfectly, beautifully built occult horror follows the roadmap of the early '70s and '80s Indie Screams with reverent precision and the occasional, wise reference to the cannon.	Puts to shame most major studio horror releases. Classy even while getting down-and-dirty, unusually savvy about the importance of tension and character nuance over viscera and a soulless body count.	West is going to do something outstanding someday, as soon as he figures out something to say.	A horror film with no punch.	Though its underlying themes are familiar, House of the Devil effectively sheds the loud and gory cliches of contemporary horror to deliver a tense, slowly building throwback to the fright flicks of decades past.
Sure it's predictable. Sure it's a slight effort, but I still think it's pretty funny and charming.	Give me this type of writing any day over some of the inane scripts that plague a Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler flick. Simon Pegg can hold his own with any comic working today.	Simon Pegg has a great face! Not since Jerry Lewis has anyone been able to look pathetic, adorable and stupid, all at the same time.	The material isn't any more inspired than the protagonist is inspiring. Run, Fat Boy, Run should have been whipped into better shape before the starting gun sounded.	Run, Fat Boy, Run stays out of sitcom quicksand long enough to make you think that Schwimmer has a knack for this comedy-directing thing.	Run, Fat Boy, Run features sporadic laughs, but is ultimately too formulaic and predictable.
Rock takes his Good Hair job as a documentarian seriously enough to be interesting, but not so seriously that the film groans with earnestness.	Parental Content Review	In chronicling the permutations of black hair, the filmmaker ends up making a breezy statement on the universality of narcissism.	Educates more than it entertains, even though there's plenty of colorful subjects (Chris) Rock could have gently lampooned.	The subject matter would still be fairly interesting without Rock's involvement, but the comedian brings a accessibility to the material that no amount of facts and figures can replace.	Funny, informative, and occasionally sad, Good Hair is a provocative look at the complex relationship between African Americans and their hair.
Sidesteps most of the pitfalls of the genre while delivering thrilling action, vivid characters and a memorable story.	If you are in the mood for an old-fashioned adventure in exotic locales with magnificent equines and lots of familiar action, then this may be the movie for you.	Even considering its derivative nature, Hidalgo offers adventure, exotic locations, magnificent horses, a love story and heroics at every turn and that's what great matinee-style entertainment is all about.	I don't object to 'Hidalgo' because it may fudge facts...I object to it because they are used in the service of a story that is, frankly, quite boring.	If I bought tickets at Arlington Park and made a wager, the last thing I want to see is a jockey leave his mount to go rescue someone's daughter	The scenery looks great, but this overstuffed horse story contains too much cheese.
If you like "Van Helsing" and "The Punisher," then you'll enjoy this. Catwoman is worth seeing for its camp value and is better than it has any right to be.	Another hundred million dollars down the drain.	Catwoman is destined not for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fate but for immortality as one of the subtlest, most thorough parodies I've ever seen.	The complete absence of a distinct visual style robs Catwoman of its imagination and wonder. It looks and feels utterly flat, which is the kiss of death in this genre	If movies were kitty litter, Catwoman would be the kind that doesn't absorb very well and fails to clump. And it would be stinky. Really, really stinky.	Halle Berry is the lone bright spot, but even she can't save this laughable action thriller.
Tell No One darts its way past all the improbabilities and clichĂ (C)s that weigh down most mysteries, shooting toward a conclusion that's both endearingly old-fashioned and satisfying.	It attempts no improvements on the basic suspense formula. It just does everything really well: perfect pacing, lovely camera work, spot-on acting and an ingenious plot.	Tell No One is a French action thriller and murder mystery that doesn't cheat.	Canet has a good feeling for lowlife atmosphere and he works up a few fine Hitchcockian twirls.	Actually too clever by half, but also so skillfully played that it carries you breathlessly along for the duration.	An intense, well-crafted thriller, Tell No One is equal parts heart-pounding and heart-wrenching.
A sparkling light comic mystery of the kind that Hollywood doesn't make anymore -- pity.	Whenever the move threatens to work, there's Chevy Chase with his monotone, deadpan cynicism, distancing himself from the material.	A breezy, peppy frolic and a tour de force for Chase.	This could be Bob Hope material c1942 and Chase does acquit himself well (though with cool reserve) in the gags-to-plot transitions. What dulls the enterprise is that Ritchie so keeps his distance from every character.	What truly holds Fletch together isn't the somewhat off-putting Chase--whose screen presence was always defined by a love-it-or-hate it smugness--but his time-tested collaborators: screenwriter Bergman...and director Michael Ritchie...[Blu-ray]	Quotably funny -- and fast-paced enough to smooth over the jokes that don't land -- Fletch is one of the best big-screen vehicles for Chevy Chase's brand of smug silliness.
...this spunky little film doesn't let the minor matter of a bland central character and a lackluster script get it down.	Valiant is sadly boring, and while its rote mechanics may function nominally on children, it's going to be a long 76 minutes for the adults.	This cleverly told animated World War II adventure aims high and scores a pretty lofty goal.	Despite its formulaic trappings, 'Valiant' proves that great heartfelt storytelling will almost always win out over big budget brawn.	Arguably the blandest of the burgeoning crop of big budget digitally animated films, Valiant aims to prove that the death of traditional animation has simply pushed lackluster screenplays into the digital realm.	Valiant has a good collection of voice talents, but the story is strictly by-the-numbers.
To call this Kevin James comedy fatuous might be misinterpreted as an attack on the star's girth -- so how about inane, tepid, lazy, puerile, phony, and unfunny?	An unfunny comedy with a limited imagination and a steady diet of fat jokes.	This comedy from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company takes itself too seriously for its own good.	The film is completely forgettable, frequently funny and weirdly satisfying in a Jersey Loser Gets Respect kind of way.	It's surprisingly okay, in a January kind of way.	Paul Blart: Mall Cop has some laughs, but its plot is flimsy and lacking in any sustained comic momentum.
A very funny and warm effort, Four Weddings strives to recapture the screwball sensibility of another era, succeeding to a surprising degree.	The infectious charm and sunny goodwill of Four Weddings and a Funeral can so immediately buoy a soul ravaged by winter weather and winter movies.	A very good viewing experience.	Four Weddings is more a romantic screwball comedy, one is as intoxicated by words, dialogue and characters as by love.	Delightful and sly.	While frothy to a fault, Four Weddings and a Funeral features irresistibly breezy humor, and winsome performances from Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell.
This sumptuously designed film...has all the ingredients of a juicy historical romp. But it's bloodless, fussy, and undermined by Hilary Swank's stiff, one-note performance.	Shyer ... fails to whip the production into anything very special, and Swank seems hopelessly miscast and weak at its center.	A discombobulated, transparently fictionalized French Revolutionary melodrama.	While director Charles Shyer ... may have succeeded in creating an appropriate environment for all this skulduggery, he does so at the expense of coherent storytelling and drama.	It's all about as elegant as jewelry from a home-shopping channel.	A film about court intrigue, The Affair of the Necklace turns out to be more dull than juicy. Swank seems flat and miscast in the central role of Jeanne.
Though it doesn't delve deep into the personalities of the amiably nerdy players, the nimbly edited film manages to eke some tension out of a three-way championship match.	With affectionate humor and quirky, low-key charm, first-time documentary filmmaker Patrick Creadon leads us on an engaging tour of the world of New York Times/NPR puzzle guru Will Shortz.	Enticing, delightful and any word for 'highly entertaining' that will fit in a bunch of little boxes on a page.	While the handling of the matter may seem slight, this is crossword puzzles we're talking about here, not rocket science - you enjoy them, throw them away, and move on.	Even if you've never done a crossword in your life or been frustrated by the attempt, you will likely be drawn into this intriguing world through the enthusiasm expressed by its adherents.	You see them hunched over with their brows furrowed, folded newspaper in hand as they attempt to complete the crossword puzzle. This may even describe you. This ingeniously edited documentary introduces viewers to some of the more dedicated fans of this solitary pastime, none more well-known the puzzle editor for the New York Times, Will Shortz. This underground world provides a surprising amount of crowd-pleasing entertainment and suspense, especially at the annual crossword tournament. Didn't know there was one, did you?
Men in Black 3 is so dull and empty, it's the first movie that has ever made me think "Thank God this is in 3D."	Is there any big movie star performance more genuinely charming than Will Smith's Agent J? Even when this latest chapter in the series is at its sloggiest, Smith saves the day.	Josh Brolin's hilarious turn as the younger version of the character made famous by Tommy Lee Jones is alone worth the price of admission.	In the mists of the past, damned if an old tune doesn't find some new energy. Delight, a modest yet palpable measure of the stuff, is restored.	Men in Black 3 is a series of okay gags and okay action sequences, with enough elements to make it moderately enjoyable.	It isn't exactly a persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchise, but Men in Black III is better than its predecessor and manages to exceed expectations.
But what makes Baghead more than just a hipster version of The Blair Witch Project (young filmmakers in the woods, being terrified) is the bromance at its core.	The truth eventually comes out, as it must, and it's not exactly a stunner.	Even in the spookiest woods in the dead of night, there will be no difficulty figuring this one out.	While the acting is uneven and the focus wavers, the Duplasses take several well-aimed potshots at their bloated industry.	It's entertaining, often funny and ultimately endearing, thanks mainly to its ensemble cast.	Pitting actors against murderers in a self-aware struggle for stardom, Baghead successfully skates the borders of horror and comedy.
Sometimes dense and impenetrable, but it also contains an unusually thoughtful consideration of the difference between faith and belief.	Unnecessarily complex in parts, Constantine still delivers a supernatural wallop, fueling a never-ending fascination with what lies beyond our world.	Swinton's presence proves as strange as the rest of this sometimes-stimulating but often-ludicrous endeavor.	The end explanation seems as reasonable and metaphysically valid as a Pokémon card battle. That's OK, though, because Constantine is all about look, sound and feel.	A deceptively thoughtful tale tricked up like an action movie; it's beautiful to look at but even more lovely to ruminate over.	Despite solid production values and an intriguing premise, Constantine lacks the focus of another spiritual shoot-em-up, The Matrix.
The movie flowed as though every scene and every line of dialogue was decided on the fly.	A mix of road-trip, coming-of-age and gross-out comedy cliches.	About 65 minutes of plot and 30 of slow-mo skating highlights, rather obviously performed by professionals dressed as the characters.	I think actually guys and women, who love skateboarding, probably won't like this movie because it doesn't do it justice-the skill it really takes to be at the top of the game.	Akin to a real skateboarding show, Grind lands a few tricks but ends up falling on its face the rest of the time.	Mediocre skateboard stunts are padded by a half-baked plot and one-dimensional characters.
A father-son heart-tugger wrapped around a mushy reconciliation rom-com sprinkled with tinsel of shiny Hollywood supporting stars acting like they're in another movie entirely.	An acceptable but very slim romantic comedy.	Smarmy. Dopey. Sloppy. Lazy. Creepy. Tone-deaf. Predictable. Embarrassing. Lousy.	The comedy has its moments but they are few, and a high-powered cast, which also includes Judy Greer and Dennis Quaid, give mostly low-powered performances.	Fox hasn't penned a script since 1993's So I Married an Axe Murderer, and he apparently hasn't left his home, either ...	Witless, unfocused, and arguably misogynistic, Playing for Keeps is a dispiriting, lowest-common-denominator Hollywood rom-com.
An indolent and painfully unfunny attempt at comedy with uninspired, forced humor and annoying characters that have zero chemistry.	More of an extended sketch than a comedy classic. Still, it has Robert Downey Jr. in a comic role, which is a fine use of his incredible talents.	Todd Phillips needs to get off the road.	The actors could have coasted on the odd-couple script, but they both dig deep into their characters.	Remember the John Candy/Steve Martin comedy 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'? If so, 'Due Date' will bring it back to mind because it's a blend of that film and "The Hangover."	Shamelessly derivative and only sporadically funny, Due Date doesn't live up to the possibilities suggested by its talented director and marvelously mismatched stars.
With co-writers Steve Schmidt, Peter Joshua, and Jessica Bendinger, Demme takes a whack at a remake and mucks it up completely.	It's destined to do for Thandie Newton what Roman Holiday long ago did for Audrey Hepburn. Spread the word: A star is born.	If you love film, you've got to see this movie once, even if only to shake your head at the screen and wonder how this script ever got made.	fresh, jazzy and fun	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us.	Newton has star quality, but this exercise in style can't hold a candle to the original.
Inkheart is a fantastic read, and I wasn't expecting the film to live up to it at all. Much simpler than the book, the film is still a pretty fantastic ride. The story is changed around a bit but the main characters are there, exactly as you remember them	[U]nquestionably for children, but unlike many children's movies, it does not assume kids are stupid or will respond only to toilet humor or slapstick...	Another fantasy adventure story based on a bestselling book that turns out to be a dud.	If you can ignore Fraser and his trademark lumpishness, Inkheart is imaginative and entertaining.	While the story proves the pen is mightier than the sword, this flaccid adaptation proves the book is mightier than the film.	Heavy on cliches and light on charm, this kid-lit fantasy-adventure doesn't quite get off the ground.
Carl Foreman's brilliant screenplay pays due respect to each character, no matter how sad or loathsome.	High Noon combines its points about good citizenship with some excellent picturemaking.	Just a good guy, a bad guy, and a clean-cut ending that leaves you shrugging the whole thing off.	Meaningful in its implications, as well as loaded with interest and suspense, High Noon is a western to challenge Stagecoach for the all-time championship.	Drop-dead brilliant Western Noir.	A classic of the Western genre that broke with many of the traditions at the time, High Noon endures -- in no small part thanks to Gary Cooper's defiant, Oscar-winning performance.
But, is it just me, or is Karras's the only story that's really compelling?	Friedkin and Blatty seem to care nothing for their characters as people, only as victims-props to be abused, hurled about the room, beaten and, in one case, brutally murdered.	a brilliantly constructed, chilling tale of demonic possession and medical torture	A sour odor of spiritual guilt wafts through every fascinating minute of The Exorcist.	This is the dark frightening place where modern horror cinema began.	The Exorcist rides its supernatural theme to magical effect, with remarkable special effects and an eerie atmosphere, resulting in one of the scariest films of all time.
Subjecting kids to such shoddy junk when they could be watching `Spirited Away' or `Finding Nemo' should count as cinematic child abuse.	Below-average for series and too violent for younger kids.	There are, alas, the requisite new characters and this round it's a pair of winged critters with high-pitched grating 'voices' that sound most awfully like Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live.	Surely a form of child abuse.	The story is also less violent and combative.	This series isn't getting any better.
As far as Big Day experiences go, a drunken speech from a distant relative would be far more entertaining -- and funnier -- than The Wedding Date.	Kilner's light touch keeps the romantic pair dancing around their romance without tripping, but as the film reaches the inevitable happy ending, the steps look all too familiar.	Even if the material is terribly formulaic and derivative, it's still such a simple, by-the-numbers romantic comedy that only a Herculean effort could mess it up. And the filmmakers have managed to do exactly that.	Messing-Mulroney romantic comedy has "something borrowed" in its plot -- and a sense of missed opportunity that'll leave you blue.	confuses sex with romance	Critics are leaving The Wedding Date at the alter, calling it shopworn, bland, and lightweight.
Kisses regards the world through fearful, foolhardy preadolescent eyes.	An engaging and well-acted Irish film about two pre-teens who escape their oppressive life in a slum for an adventure in the city of Dublin.	Both sweet and tough, with vivid characters and an unnerving sense of danger.	Sincere and vulnerable, aching with youthful insight	Cute but foul-mouthed, tough but vulnerable and obviously crazy about each other in a reticent way, these kids are a wonderful presence, giving the most contrived scenes genuine emotion and a veneer of realness.	Although admittedly sleight, this gritty but tender coming-of-age Irish drama features some impressive work both in front, and behind the camera.
It bears a resemblance to viscerally exciting seventies urban thrillers like The French Connection, in which only the fascists could do what needed to be done.	A poor man's City of God that suggests the only answer to the problems of Brazil's slums are blazing guns wielded by a neo-fascist police force.	Subtle shades of friendship are lost in a melee of violence, which quickly crescendos and then maintains a one-note intensity for the duration of the film, punctuated only by an ill-advised narratorial voice that serves to keep the viewer at arm's length.	Pois й infinitamente mais recompensador assistir a um filme que estimula a discussгo e a auto-anбlise do que um que, por covardia ou falta de ambiзгo, limita-se a seguir a corrente do politicamente correto.	[José Padilha] recariously pitches the squad's brute force as less a necessary evil than the outgrowth of an existing evil -- a no-win situation that mocks liberal ideals and warps conservative pragmatism into domestic terrorism.	Brutal, action heavy, Brazilian cop film with a pointless voiceover. Lacks flair, overdoes the violence and is never quite sure where its morals lie.
The movie could be trying to say that for some people religion is an escape from their sexuality, but it seems unlikely.	A movie that has come to define Biblical epic.	A majestic achievement, representing a superb blending of the motion picture arts by master craftsmen.	Still making waves in movies today -- from The Phantom Menace's Podrace to the whole of Gladiator -- little can come close to captivating the grandeur and epic quality of William Wyler's magnificent bum numb-er.	Entire new frontiers in boredom were opened up by this MGM whopper from 1959.	Uneven, but in terms of epic scope and grand spectacle, Ben-Hur still ranks among Hollywood's finest examples of pure entertainment.
By largely limiting the action to the monks' ascetic daily lives, Beauvois helps the their musing become the audience's own.	Be prepared to be shaken.	Of Gods and Men, a transcendent drama of uplift and inspiration, reveals the cavernous divide between heaven and Earth.	That almost unheard-of film that you do not judge — it judges you.	Monks' faith is tested by religious extremists next door	Patient and restrained, Of Gods and Men asks deep, profound questions that will linger in the audience's mind long after the movie.
You won't be scared one bit, but that's not exactly the point here. The murder is the only message.	[Director] Wong and [writer] Morgan honed their skills on The X-Files, Millenium and The Commish and it shows in their ability to create suspense and tension as well as carnage.	The problem with FD3 is since it is clear to everyone who must die and in what order, the drama is reduced to a formula in which ominous events accumulate while the teenagers remain oblivious.	Convincingly pointless and breezy in its hedonistic hokum...Hence, the third time around is not the charm for this foolish and faceless fright flick.	Death finds gloriously grisly new ways to deal with teenagers who dare to spit in his face.	Final Destination 3 is more of the same: gory and pointless, with nowhere new to go.
An emotional smackdown. Rourke's never been better, and the change of pace and texture suits Aronofsky perfectly. The Raging Bull of wrestling movies? Oh, go on then.	If this ragged but near-brilliant movie is about a guy trying to resurrect his career, so too is the performance at its heart.	It must have been extremely hard for Rourke to play The Ram because he had to revisit some of the most difficult moments of his life, but it actually ends up helping his performance because it feels so genuine and sincere.	The movie is populated with real wrestlers, and it makes sure to nail all the little details.	Rourke, in a role that could have invited outsized characterization, instead offers modesty and understatement. This small performance, in a small film, is by far the biggest of his career.	Mickey Rourke gives a performance for the ages in The Wrestler, a richly affecting, heart-wrenching yet ultimately rewarding drama.
This is the first feature film role for Moore and he delivers a performance that is sweet, smart, naive and -- when needed -- tough. His performance comes across as strong as many veteran actors.	An authentic inner-city parable that fails to live up to its initial promise.	All three leads are charming, and together, they convey a real sense of camaraderie, the kind that only develop between misfits who find each other.	The film's rascally kineticism very nearly compensates for its underdeveloped ideas.	The tone is fast and funny, with a modern "Risky Business" or "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" vibe, but there's an additional layer that stems from the violence of the neighborhood.	Featuring a starmaking performance from Shameik Moore and a refreshingly original point of view from writer-director Rick Famuyiwa, Dope is smart, insightful entertainment.
What it all means is up for grabs, but for connoisseurs of sadomasochistic nastiness, it's a must-see.	Riveting to watch largely due to Asia Argento's presence, Assayas' new film, suitably placed at the Midnight Section, displays visual fluency and other innovative devices deiberately applied to a lower-level subject that some will dismiss as trash.	Writer-director Olivier Assayas must have been working out some personal demons to make something as embarrassing as Boarding Gate, the most trite and trivial piece of sleaze since Abel Ferrara's Snake Eyes.	This hypnotic, angular thriller about sex, murder, betrayal and money takes you on a feverish journey from nowhere to somewhere.	There are long, droning bouts of dialog about nothing meant to link scenes together, but all Boarding Gate really does is fixate on watching Asia Argento do stuff.	Boarding Gate has little substance beneath its faux-thriller surface, and marks a step down from director Olivier Assayas' usual work.
An overachiever of a film that practically defines the term summer blockbuster.	In this tricked-out retake on the much-loved contraptions, director Michael Bay brings his usual chest-thumping, combustive bombast, but he also brings some clever pacing and a genuinely snappy wit. It is not all stupid and not all loud.	All you can do is grin, shake your head and let Transformers steamroll you into having a blast.	Hated the robots and their funny voices, hated the humans, and the cereal box story.	it's the transformation of robots that will blow your mind ... Add that to the eye-popping robot smackdowns and good old fashioned car chases, and you have a movie that is going to get your blood pumping and your heartbeat racing	While believable characters are hard to come by in Transformers, the effects are staggering and the action is exhilarating.
An energetically quirky social metaphor, political commentary and action/sci-fi farce all balled up into one outrageously enjoyable experience, provided you like the work of Terry Gilliam.	Not in everybody's taste, but why risk missing one of the most brilliant science fiction movies ever made?	Brazil offers a chillingly hilarious vision of the near-future.	Hollywood is notoriously plagued by commercial incentive and a lack of art; Brazil is a rare success, particularly so because it is decidedly anti-commercial.	Fortunately the story of an alternative future is realised with such visual imagination and sparky humour that it's only half way through that the plot's weaknesses become apparent.	Brazil, Terry Gilliam's visionary Orwellian fantasy, is an audacious dark comedy, filled with strange, imaginative visuals.
A glossy miscalculation with Nathan Lane and Robin Williams.	Campy, comedic romp with lots of profanity.	Nathan Lane, I would personally like to send you a big, fat kiss of admiration.	This movie is THE definition of average. Not bad, but not good.	If The Birdcage isn't exactly the Mike Nichols-Elaine May movie of our dreams, it does manage to transform what was formerly a campy bit of French fluff into one of the loopiest, most hysterical family-values movies ever made.	Mike Nichols wrangles agreeably amusing performances from Robin Williams and Nathan Lane in this fun, if not quite essential, remake of the French comedy La Cage aux Folles.
Once again, Reitman the screenwriter gives Reitman the director an excuse to ponder the spaces between us and the ties that bind. Or don't.	Nobody plays the guilty corporate insider better than Clooney. Let him through. He's got a titanium ticket.	Today, this story of people who are hired to fire other people brings a timely punch to the gut that, almost by accident, adds a resonance that's hard to shake.	Perhaps only George Clooney could make getting fired sound like a positive development.	A down-to-earth look at 21st Century dating habits in this no-strings age of friends with benefits.	Led by charismatic performances by its three leads, director Jason Reitman delivers a smart blend of humor and emotion with just enough edge for mainstream audiences.
...a genuine classic, a unique blend of violence, humor, poignancy, and imagination.	A perfect version of the thing it sets out to be, one of the most intellectual and propulsive of all '80s action films.	It's Verhoeven's scabrous dissection of American social issues, trashy sitcom culture and corporate greed that makes this comic-book opus a subversive and thought-provoking edge-of-the-seat treat.	deals with Reagan's mad vision of a bellicose, secretive consumer wonderland as the City on the Hill.	Whatever may have been in the minds of the writers, Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, has more trouble emerging from Mr. Verhoeven's sizzling battles than poor Murphy does from his robosuit.	While over-the-top and gory, Robocop is also a surprisingly smart sci-fi flick that uses ultraviolence to disguise its satire of American culture.
At the almost-two-hour mark, the film, which seems poised to keep going with yet another bravura sequence of magic, suddenly wraps everything up really fast.	I struggled to find the source of imperfection in this film	Not instructive, as Disney is, and not aloof, like anime. Spirited Away is fun without being a lesson, and it welcomes you in.	At its heart and most importantly, Spirited Away concerns a little girl learning to honour her friends and her family by valuing herself.	Spirited Away is wonderful.	Spirited Away is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by the world around them.
Boasts breathtaking images and, thanks to Mr. Tolkien, a story that's second to none.	Nothing less than a masterpiece of art and integrity, capturing with vast magnitude the grandeur, majesty, and surreal whimsy of Tolkien's mythical Middle-Earth.	Jackson was undeniably the right choice for the material. He exceeds all reasonable expectations in crossing the book over. The epic literary journey becomes a cinematic event.	Middle-earth is a real world from the first reel on, thanks to incredible special effects woven seamlessly with great storytelling.	Only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation.	Full of eye-popping special effects, and featuring a pitch-perfect cast, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring brings J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to vivid life.
[Lee] nails the irritable yet alive soul of New York -- particularly, now, New York post-9/11 -- better than anyone else.	The film is tremendous entertainment, and it's an utter joy to see Spike back in action, but the filmmaker can't control himself completely, and he exits Inside Man on an infuriating whimper.	Hugely entertaining, the film strikes a near-flawless balance between sly pop-culture allusions and the details of how business gets done under pressure.	The more it sags as a thriller, the more it jabs and jangles as a study of racial abrasion.	Inside Man is a hybrid of studio action pic and Spike Lee joint. Or else it's a cross between a 2006 Spike Lee joint and a 1970s-style movie indictment of urban unease.	Spike Lee's energetic and clever bank-heist thriller is a smart genre film that is not only rewarding on its own terms, but manages to subvert its pulpy trappings with wit and skill -- and Denzel Washington is terrific as a brilliant hostage negotiator.
The whole thing reeks of the formulaic, of a carefully packaged bid to propel the star back to his appointed place in the commercial constellation, all the while depriving him of the dark side that got him there in the first place.	It'll be a miracle if the movie isn't a hit but my guess is that, upon seeing it, only the very rare viewer will give thanks.	... manages to walk a tightrope between comedic elements and 'Almighty' elements... God's teaching Bruce a life lesson, and everything (Bruce) does has to count if it's going to stick.	Happily, Carrey is back with his trademark facial expressions and outrageous physical comedy.	Bruce Almighty is proof that "high concept" movies can also be well-crafted and ambitious...There's plenty of smart comic filmmaking at play throughout.	Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle.
The gimmick has its poetic moments, but the actors can't do much to make screenwriter Gabrielle Zevin's strategems for characters seem like real people.	Le film d'Hans Canosa apparaît comme un effort d'une grande maturité, dégageant une spontanéité et une honnęteté surprenante pour un film majoritairement axé sur les dialogues	The observations about love and sex and time and memory are uncommonly sharp and true.	A near-perfect amalgamation of cinematic technique and content.	The posturing twosome in the movie are themselves a compendium of stylish ticks in need of substantive redemption -- for once, the gimmick is a perfect reflection of the characters.	Its occasional use of split screen may feel gimmicky at times, but Conversations With Other Women is a bold, inventive drama carried by its two charismatic leads.
Passably funny, though one suspects even diehard sci-fi buffs will find the film's wall-to-wall pop referencing tiring and a tad lazy. Doesn't anybody write genuine jokes any more?	Smart and savvy.	Enthusiastically acted and sharply written. A big old lovefest in honor of the classic alien visitation movies that we all hold near and dear.	Beam us up, Scotty. There's no intelligent life here.	Nearly everyone involved in Paul has been part of some kind of comedic masterpiece, which may be why I can't help wishing this perfectly good movie had gotten a little closer to being great.	It doesn't measure up to Pegg and Frost's best work, but Paul is an amiably entertaining -- albeit uneven -- road trip comedy with an intergalactic twist.
Pretty enough, but one kind of hopes for a little magic in a movie with "magicians" in its title.	Norbu never allows anything to stray beyond the lukewarm on his pleasant highway idyll. Strong emotions are strictly off limits.	There is much more to Travellers & Magicians than a mere travelogue, and the journey is well worth the price of admission.	The exotic landscapes combine with subtle realizations for a moving human work.	Refreshingly quiet and thoughtful.	Interwined tales of spiritual discovery are set against a gorgeous, evocative landscape in this pleasant, engaging import.
The remake, from first-time director Snyder, keeps much of the gore and loads up on the laughs, but eschews all pretence at cultural criticism in favour of high-octane, almost nonstop action.	Few of the original movie's political and philosophical preoccupations (abortion, capitalism, patriotism, individualism) remain. Instead, the remake feels like the product of the PlayStation era.	A pretty decent way to cannibalize a classic.	Embora fique devendo o comentбrio social que transformou o filme original em um clбssico, Madrugada dos Mortos й uma produзгo eficiente e divertida que merece aplausos.	The new Dawn won't be revered like the old one, but if there's a sequel, I'll shamble instinctively to the theater.	A kinetic, violent and surprisingly worthy remake of George Romero's horror classic that pays homage to the original while working on its own terms.
The three main child actors, including Emma Watson as Hermione, have gained in confidence and grown nicely into their roles and all of the regular ensemble from the first film return.	Chamber of Secrets justifies its 161-minute running time by successfully conjuring a transporting sense of place and injecting stronger themes of darkness and corruption into Harry's previously whimsical existence.	Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books, they can't go wrong. Better effects, better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh. An excellent sequel.	Once again, Chris Columbus stays out of J.K. Rowling's way, sticking to the text and hitting each narrative beat cleanly and vigorously.	Where Chamber of Secrets will be viewed a success is in accurately, and occasionally imaginatively, bringing the book to life. As a movie, judged on its own merits, it's too long, too slow and too unfocused.	Though perhaps more enchanting for younger audiences, Chamber of Secrets is nevertheless both darker and livelier than its predecessor, expanding and improving upon the first film's universe.
... rich with joyous ritual and spiritual sincerity...	The film rests squarely on the backs of Rand and his wife, who snatches the spotlight from her professionally trained husband in her acting debut.	It invites you in like a welcomed guest to enjoy this little story and warms your heart and lightens your day at the same time.	Fervent without edging over into preachiness, the film examines the humor that can be found in the lives of the bushy-bearded, curly-sideburns set who live by a strict interpretation of the Torah.	From several perspectives, Ushpizin is a marvel.	Ushpizin offers a rare and warmly intimate look into ultra-Orthodox Jewish culture.
From beginning to end, City of God doesn't just hold you; it clutches your lapels with its lurid exuberance.	A violent, thoroughly electrifying vision of Rio during the volatile 1970s, and possibly the first great crime film of the 21st century.	Part Godfather, part Lord of the Flies, City of God stings with a jolt of uncontrolled rage.	Long and difficult to watch, but it is never dull.	...juggles with a fleet sense of flair the very things that bogged `Gangs of New York' down.	A shocking and disturbing, but always compelling look at life in the slums of Rio de Janiero.
The humour is aimed at teens but Jones' likeable presence make this a pleasant watch.	Chalet Girl is what it says on the label - feel-good, unpretentious, snowbound fun.	Pursues its way to its feelgood conclusion with just a little wit and a goodly lump of sentiment.	It's steered to success - just - by Jones, a natural, likeable everygirl who will make you care, possibly against your will, about a story as old as the Alps.	This movie's resemblances to Pretty Woman are a bit worrying.	Chalet Girl is light comedic fun geared for teenage girls, featuring a charming performance from Felicity Jones.
One of the most original cinematic talents at work in this country, Van Sant has a knack for pulling disparate elements together and twisting them into wildly funny lyrical odysseys of the mind and heart.	If played straight, this would have had depth, but been an awful cinematic experience.	Back when Gus Van Sant actually was a filmmaker...	An essential testament to the beauty and chops of the late River Phoenix...	Audacious, controversial, directional, important and totally unique, you'll either love it or hate it. But see it!	A tantalizing glimpse of a talented director and his stars all at the top of their respective games, Gus Van Sant's loose reworking of Henry IV is smart, sad and audacious.
It all seemed so forgettable like one of those dreams you might have on a suburban train.	In the context of French filmmaker Patrice Leconte's canon, Man on the Train qualifies as an anecdote. But it may stay with some viewers longer than an epic poem.	Leconte manages to stretch this very simple story into a very watchable film.	A boldly conceived, impeccably crafted and wonderfully enigmatic two-character study that turns out to be a most powerful showcase for its two stars.	For the most part, [Leconte] pulls back and lets the two stars do their thing. And they do it marvelously.	A lovely, contemplative character study with two wonderful performances at its center.
If I had anything kind to say about Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz before this film, I'm ready to take every word back...a shrill monstrosity of a romantic comedy.	What Happens in Vegas contains enough unbridled silliness to salvage its lowbrow high concept.	At least they party harder than the 21 kids.	Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz hate on each other with dynamite verve in What Happens in Vegas.	The outcome of What Happens In Vegas is obvious, but the journey there is fun.	What Happens in Vegas has a few laughs, but mostly settles for derivative romantic comedy conventions and receives little help from a pair of unlikable leads.
Intriguing and obliquely involving.	It may be time for Van Sant to remove his head from -- well, let's call it the underground -- and re-find his inner Forrester.	Paranoid Park confirms that Gus Van Sant is so far up his own artistic anus, it's impossible to take anything he makes seriously anymore...a crisp, white hanky doused with cinematic chloroform pressed tightly across the face.	Paranoid Park is a supernaturally perfect fusion of Van Sant's current conceptual-art-project head-trip aesthetic and Blake Nelson's finely tuned first-person 'young adult' novel.	Van Sant's film is almost calculatedly minor, but it gets at something about adolescence as a wobbly and transitional business, not the semi-permanent grunge idyll he's sometimes guilty of loving a little too much.	Director Gus Van Sant once again superbly captures the ins and outs of teenage life in Paranoid Park, a quietly devastating portrait of a young man living with guilt and anxiety.
Smug, sanitized fantasy, in which the hysterical blonde attention-seeker, in a succession of sparkly outfits, is uprooted from New York to the boring suburbs and learns boring suburban values like telling the truth.	Lindsay Lohan stars in this modest, mildly engaging film as a proudly bohemian resident of Greenwich Village who is transplanted to a prosperous suburb in New Jersey.	...a perfectly bland, homogenized, milquetoast piece of inconsequential would-be comedy fluff.	It's a pubescent fantasia without soul or purpose beyond positioning star Lindsay Lohan as the successor to Hilary Duff's throne.	I can't think of a teen who would enjoy watching Confessions	Sloppily assembled fluff that won't have much of interest for anyone who isn't a preteen girl.
Tentando evocar a mesma atmosfera sufocante de Los Angeles %u2013 Cidade Proibida, surge como pбlida (literalmente) imitaзгo do excepcional trabalho de Curtis Hanson.	It's worth seeing for Affleck alone, deftly communicating the distance between the put-on cardboard debonairness of this hunk-about-town and the gnawing uncertainties beneath his Superman outfit.	Despite a stellar cast, Coulter and screenwriter Paul Bernbaum can’t decide whether to plumb the depths of 'noir' or tug at the heartstrings of failed ambition.	Strong ensemble performances, tight direction, and a stand out from Affleck make this an excellent revisiting of an old Hollywood case...	May not have all the answers about the death of one of the icons behind the big red 'S,' but by gathering one of the better ensembles of the year, it makes the legend interesting again.	More than a movie star murder mystery, Hollywoodland takes it slow in order to reveal the intriguing details of the rise and fall of superstar fame.
While by no means a masterpiece, when Craig Mazin riffs on the "Spider-Man" trilogy, "Superhero Movie" is cause for some occasional chuckles...	There are a few lively bits, and one joke with an edge: a slap at Stephen Hawking and his computer-drone voice. Mostly, though, this is super-lame.	Nсo tсo desastroso quanto outras imitaушes baratas das produушes do ZAZ, mas ainda assim apelativo e irregular.	Writer-director and Scary Movie vet Craig Mazin's script is so devoid of anything even remotely funny that the movie is more a cheap rip-off of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise than a spoof.	Superhero Movie would make a decent long-form short on the "Funny or Die" website, but at 85 minutes -- 15 of which are outtake-heavy end credits -- its powers of amiability wear off fast.	Superhero Movie is not the worst of the spoof genre, but relies on tired gags and lame pop culture references all the same.
This sucks. I'm sorry there's no other way to put it.	A really good not-great movie, the kind that would be classified as a guilty pleasure were it not executed with guilt-free honesty and good nature.	The stars give [the movie] so many knee-slapper moments you'll want to wear long thick pants to save your thighs.	An affectionate satire of the late-'70s action series, it retains an agreeable small-screen modesty.	While it's never plain bad, the film is not really plain good, and very seldom plain funny. (Mildly amusing fits.)	It's uneven and occasionally somewhat aimless, but Starsky & Hutch benefits from Stiller and Wilson's chemistry and a surprisingly warm-hearted script.
Unable to deliver the single novel concept or unexpected surprise that might justify its existence.	To enjoy Saw II, one must have enjoyed Saw. This is a given. As to which is better, this is a fairly pointless question given how bad both of these movies are.	An utterly sadistic horror picture that exists for no other reason and has no discernible point apart from getting horror fans to shell out a few bucks.	Bousman a su trafiquer la facture originale pour en accentuer l'impact et la rendre, aussi étrange que cela puisse paraitre, un peu plus crédible.	The film doesn't take the direction most sequels do and manages to adequately follow up the original.	Saw II is likely to please the gore-happy fans of the original, though it may be too gruesome for those not familiar with first film's premise.
Without much insight into the self-dramatizing enigma of Conway, nor any representation of the solitary auteur he impersonated, the film becomes a repetitive series of small-scale con games played on cabdrivers, bar owners and wannabe stars.	Colour Me Kubrick is a somewhat fictionalized accounting of this amazing but true story. The filmmakers have wisely turned it into a comedy, and a wickedly entertaining one at that.	It's an impressive moving wax museum, certainly, but even metatextual follies eventually need a pulse.	A ludicrous, but entertaining look at a real-life Kubrick impersonator, played with over-the-top glee by Malkovich.	Scarcely an insightful biographical portrait, Color Me Kubrick is still interesting, perhaps even intimidating, as a study of the way fandom can so readily be turned against itself.	Colour Me Kubrick has a fascinating premise, but provides little insight into Kubrick and the man who impersonated him.
This is a hard-hitting item, ably directed, splendidly lensed, neatly acted, which has all the ingredients wanted by action fans and then some.	What more could a body want?	The one that started it all. A classic Western!	The first and one of the best of the spaghetti westerns	Egregiously synthetic but engrossingly morbid, violent film.	With Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo as his template, Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars helped define a new era for the Western and usher in its most iconic star, Clint Eastwood.
The Wolfman boasts a solid principal cast from Del Toro to Hopkins and up-and-comer Emily Blunt, but Del Toro especially seems to be going through the motions at half speed, as if waiting for the beast and the stuntmen to take it from there. Only H	After a troubled production, the remake of the horror classic finally arrives in theatres decidedly worse for the wear.	By pandering to the Avatar market's debased taste and indifference to storytelling details, this technically polished, emotionally crude remake sets back the advances that once had been made in horror movies.	"An American Werewolf In London" still retains its title as the best werewolf movie ever made.	To mix monsters -- The Wolfman is one of those films that was put together like Frankenstein. With all the bloody musical chairs, The Wolfman should collapse. But the Wolfman has enough camp and verve to grab you by the throat. And maybe the funny bone.	Suitably grand and special effects-laden, The Wolfman suffers from a suspense-deficient script and a surprising lack of genuine chills.
A film as edgy as a rubber knife.	Even fans of good, old-fashioned, onscreen torture will find themselves rolling their eyes at the twists and turns in this impossibly convoluted story.	Two of the more degrading and debasing hours of big-screen "entertainment" that you are likely to endure in this lifetime.	Like many villains before him, John turns out to have been wronged rather randomly, an act of terrible violence that he absorbs into his worldview.	Opens with the clinically graphic dissection of the deceased Jigsaw, who finally lives up to (dies down to?) his name by being separated into pieces...	Saw IV is more disturbing than compelling, with material already seen in the prior installments.
What a pleasure it is to watch two comic pros getting a real workout.	A plain ol' enjoyable time at the movies.	In & Out doesn't take itself seriously for a moment, which is why the halcyon-happy schmaltz that floats through the movie and floods the last reel is forgivable.	It's tough to be too hard on In & Out, because Rudnick's script is so often so sharp.	If only it was gay in the old sense of the word.	It doesn't always find comfortable ground between broad comedy and social commentary, but lively performances -- especially from Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack -- enrich In & Out's mixture of laughs and sexual tolerance.
A typical IMAX spectacle of enormous proportions, the film is both a fantastic summary of the knowledge we've gained through Hubble and an often edge-of-your-seat documentary about some of the specialists who've serviced the telescope five times.	Hubble is a wonderful machine, and this is a phenomenal movie.	The IMAX screen is the ultimate planetarium in the awesome documentary Hubble 3D.	Hubble 3D doesn't weigh in heavily on theories of Big Bangs, evolution, or creation. Instead, it lets the visual data speak for itself.	It's a movie that not only puts you in space but lets you travel through it with a speed and wonder that would make James T. Kirk go a little weak in the knees.	Offering a stunning, expansive viewing experience, Hubble 3D takes advantage of IMAX and 3-D technology like no other film.
Damned if director James Wan, the auteur of Saw's rusted-edge cruelty, isn't an ace with enjoyable spookhouse trap-springing.	...2013's horror film to beat. (Video review)	This is a horror film where a pair of suddenly clapping hands gives you the heebie-jeebies, and Wan doesn't cheat with his jump scares.	A tense and exciting haunted house movie, The Conjuring relies on atmosphere rather than gore to serve up an entertaining slice of ghostie shenanigans with the simple ambition of scaring the bejesus out of viewers.	Boasting a stellar cast, a robust story and consistently energetic direction, The Conjuring is a true old fashioned ghost story, and a damn fine one at that.	Well-crafted and gleefully creepy, The Conjuring ratchets up dread through a series of effective old-school scares.
So precise, so hilarious, so biting, so smart, so perfect, in every one of its minute details that it comes as a sort of godsend.	Blends deft human observation, solidly realized characters and a few slightly domesticated moments of shock humor [to create] a comedy as rich and winning as it is offbeat.	This clever, biting high-school satire is arguably Alexander Payne's most original and accomplished film (and so far he has made only good pictures).	A dark, wickedly entertaining romp that wears its cynicism on its sleeve and sees no reason wash any of it off.	The filmmakers have a great deal of fun at the expense of the pointlessness of high school elections, which aren't just popularity contests but overt wastes of time.	Election successfully combines dark humor and intelligent writing in this very witty and enjoyable film.
Andy Goldworthy's work deserves to be profiled in this breathtaking, beautiful, and fascinating look in to nature, the creative process, and of an unassuming artist...	Goldsworthy is mostly fascinating, occasionally exasperating, and so is Riedelsheimer's film.	Andy cuts an eccentric but likeable figure genuinely at a loss to explain where his inspiration comes from.	[Goldsworthy's] art is meant to be evanescent, like the nature he reveres. We are privileged to see it documented by the filmmaker's camera.	Intoxicating and meditative by turns, helped by Fred Frith's minimalist score, this film opens a portal into a singular creative mind.	Andy Goldsworthy and his art are beautifully captured in this engaging documentary.
The subtitle of the film is 'A Love Story.' The picture makes the worn term fresh, moving.	Surprisingly, this 2007 documentary about their 34-year relationship becomes more engrossing as its focus shifts from Isherwood to Bachardy...	Regardless of whether you recognize the names of Christopher Isherwood or Don Bachardy, this masterful documentary draws you into the men's lives like a star-studded bedtime tale.	Primed as we are by a culture rich in both homophobia and dirty old men, we can be forgiven for anticipating a sordid cautionary tale. It's a shock -- a happy shock -- when Chris & Don recounts a love that approaches the transcendental.	A wonderfully crafted documentary about a most unusual long-term relationship	Chris and Don paints an affecting, enlightening portrait of a one-of-a-kind love affair.
An entertaining though modest cartoon adventure.	Handily outdoes [Treasure Planet], with bravura action set pieces, a surprisingly complex romantic triangle, and thoughtful exploration of moral issues and character.	Business-as-usual movie that isn't trying to make anything more than a medium-size splash.	Its not that the film was particularly Sinbad, but it could have been much Sin-better.	Having great vocal talent breathes life into an animated story and makes it more than just a 2-dimensional cartoon. 'Who's bad?' - Brad's 'bad', so is Catherine, Michelle, Joseph, and Dennis.	Competent, but not magical.
Montiel and his collaborators can pat themselves on the back for elevating empty material just a bit, but this is disposable cinema, designed to hit and run after an opening weekend. [Blu-ray]	There's the expected amount of fist-play and bloodletting, this is also a nicelymade movie that ably confirms suitably muscular Channing Tatum as a young talent to keep an eye on.	Despite its dog-eared underpinnings, Fighting delivers some heady testoster-tainment. But it's Channing Tatum who gives it a bruising grace.	As painful as the movie's bloody bare-knuckle brawls can be to watch, they don't hold a candle to the frightening spectacle of Tatum brooding or, yikes, Terrence Howard doing whatever it is Terrence Howard's doing in this movie.	Call a movie Fighting, you expect action. Only include shots of Channing Tatum shirtless in the trailer, you expect to see half-naked Tatum. Fighting doesn't deliver either.	Though Fighting has a likable lead performer, and the fight scenes are impressive, the paper-thin plot ultimately unravels.
Marsh ... masterfully spins a harrowing tale of human arrogance that eventually gives way to cruelty bordering on the pathological.	...succeeds as theater, as entertainment, but it doesn't really attempt what Terrace tried, in his admittedly morally clumsy way. What is the light in those feral eyes and what does it mean? Can we ever hope to know?	Marsh's sensitive doc is a light look at some dark clues to the kind of creatures we really are.	After watching "Project Nim," a distressing portrait of a misguided 1970s language experiment, you'll be glad you're not a chimp in a cage. But you might want to revoke your membership in the human race.	Animal activists should push for public awareness of 'Project Nim' and its sourcebook, Elizabeth Hess' 'Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would Be Human.'	Equal parts hilarious, poignant, and heartbreaking, Project Nim not only tells a compelling story masterfully, but also raises the flag on the darker side of human nature.
Comfort food for a comfortable audience, with the TV-familiar Huffman reassuring viewers that she's really a real woman underneath that unflattering make-up.	It yanks at the heartstrings too much to qualify as an edgy comedy-drama, but it's far too bawdy to make it to the Hallmark Channel.	As Bree, who started her unhappy life as Stanley, the angular Huffman, a fine comedic actress who carried home an Emmy this fall, is a compelling portrait of wounded dignity. She is wholly fascinating and heartbreaking.	Not neat, nor tidy; a road trip-redemption movie you've never seen before.* It's really beautiful, - I hope it gives people a reason to love and tolerate where they never might have before.	if you think Huffman seems desperate in Desperate Housewives, think again.	A terrific performance by Felicity Huffman carries this unconventional but touching transgender road movie.
If the filmmakers want to shock us, fine, but at least do it with some style and wit.	A spirit-sapping exercise in female degradation fantasy.	Some inventive individual moments aside, Captivity is off-puttingly derivative and clumsily written.	Larry Cohen, an experienced horror hand, wrote this, and Joffé does his best to keep the tension boiling up to a ridiculous climax. Even so, everybody involved should be ashamed of this nasty farrago.	Lands with a resounding splat somewhere between the realm of the truly repellent and the unintentionally funny.	Lacking scares or psychological insight, Captivity is a distasteful entry in the 'torture porn' subgenre.
The most honest and human story yet from a filmmaker building a career on honesty and humanity.	Intoxicating...but the bittersweet truth about the rare, high-spirited Sideways is that its last few miles are all uphill.	A film like Sideways is the fulfillment of many hopes and desires, an audience's not least of all.	The characters in Sideways are better developed than those in the earlier films, the poignancy is just as forceful as it was in About Schmidt, and the comedy is slightly better integrated.	Provocatively sharp in its charm and thorough wit. Sideways is articulate and vibrantly realized...beautifully written with emotional insight and intoxicating flair	Charming, thoughtful, and often funny, Sideways is a decidedly mature road trip comedy full of excellent performances.
Though the movie isn't the 'Holiday' from hell, it's not one you should be anxious to go off on.	At times it feels like an extended trailer for itself with silly set-pieces (Georgia base-jumps! Georgia cooks with the chef!), but we are on her side all the way and when the happily-ever-ending arrives, we're as happy as she is.	This is the Queen Latifah performance I've been waiting for ever since she broke into movies.	It may not be much -- it's a remake of a 1950 Alec Guinness film -- but it is as bright as a Christmas bauble.	Latifah's carpe diem spirit sustains the picture, even when the script is carpe dumb.	Although Queen Latifah's bountiful life-affirming spirit permeates the film, director Wayne Wang is unable to revive this remake with any real flair.
The first big hit directed by Brian De Palma.	More superpowers from Brian De Palma, this time in high school, in a screen version of a Stephen King novel that's become a horror classic.	A total knockout. Piper Laurie gives a bravura performance as Carrie's religious fanatic mother, one of the creepiest movie characters ever.	Horror in the classic sense, horror that builds rather than constantly shocking, horror that works so well we don't need a guts and gore booster-shot every two minutes.	It's high time for the young generation of filmgoers to stop throwing their money [away] and see what a real horror movie is.	Carrie is a horrifying look at supernatural powers, high school cruelty, and teen angst -- and it brings us one of the most memorable and disturbing prom scenes in history.
Creepy, frighteningly funny and brilliant as cultural satire.	One of the most disturbing, thought-provoking and funniest films of the 1980s. This underappreciated Scorsese great is more relevant today than ever.	Worlds away from the bravura flash of other DeNiro-Scorsese collaborations, this underrated, claustrophobic, chilling satire is particularly prescient of today's celebrity-fixated society. A modern classic.	It's still a great film, just not as absolutely amazing as it could have been.	Takes an equally harsh look at the dark side of comedy, society's value of success driving people to desperate acts, and the press' bloodthirsty desire to sensationalize.	Largely misunderstood upon its release, The King of Comedy today looks eerily prescient, and features a fine performance by Robert DeNiro as a strangely sympathetic psychopath.
This movie presented a radical melange of genuine horror and self-aware comic touches, not to mention the fabulous Rick Baker special effects.	few movies had mixed comedy and horror with such utter aplomb	An American Werewolf in London, like a fine wine, just keeps getting more and more vintage.	The best movie ever written by a teenager -- Landis was 19 when he penned the first draft - and a constant comic delight.	Landis maintains the delicate balance between horror and humor until the final scene's gratuitous series of car crashes.	Terrifying and funny in almost equal measure, John Landis' horror-comedy crosses genres while introducing Rick Baker's astounding make-up effects.
Fails to generate identification with the players and their various plights.	With this wide, beautiful canvas, Winterbottom may well have produced his masterpiece.	In all other respects, this is fine, fine filmmaking, it's just hard to feel very involved.	A little like enjoying the work of the best student of a great painter. All in all, you would probably like to go back to seeing the previous work.	None of the characters are properly developed.	Though it sometimes feels cold and detached, The Claim is evocative, beautifully shot, and full of understated performances.
If You Don't Mess With the Zohan isn't the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations, it's at least the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations featuring a former Mossad agent who shags Lainie Kazan.	It's a difficult feat to manage irony without antecedent, so rather than opt for knowing caricature -- like, say, Adam Goldberg's The Hebrew Hammer -- Zohan mostly opts for empty farce: topical humor for people unfamiliar with the topic.	despite all of the film's problems, there are still plenty of very funny moments and Zohan is one of Sandler's more enjoyable characters.	Just when you think civilisation may be moving forward a bit (OK, I'm an optimist), another Adam Sandler movie comes along.	Sandler has shown some spark in more dramatic roles, so it's disappointing to see him return to his one-note 'form.'	You Don't Mess With the Zohan features intermittent laughs, and will please Sandler diehards, but after awhile the leaky premise wears thin.
...doesn't necessary punch a stake through its heart as far as cohesive plotlines and decent character development are concerned. Slickly manufactured...the intrusive gory antics coupled with a ludicrous premise makes for a mawkish mixture of mediocrity	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on.	Anne Rice's novels use vampirism to tell a story about the preciousness and fragility of life, but there's no deeper meaning in this movie ...	[T]he script isn't up to the level of the direction, nor are the uneven performances by the cast members, who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent.	Whatever life there is to the movie is what [Aaliyah] brings to it.	A muddled and campy MTV-styled vampire movie with lots of eye candy and bad accents.
Carroll's characters spend so much time talking, albeit intelligently, that the connections they make seem peculiarly synthetic.	An intriguing patchwork of relationships converges into a portrait of modern love in Playing By Heart, a wry, satisfying emotional saga.	An underrated, dreamy drama about love, lust and infidelity amongst inter-connected Los Angeleans. Jolie rises to the challenge.	As a puzzle, Playing By Heart is fairly simple. Luckily, observing the artwork of the individual pieces is more than enough reward.	A heavily mixed bag; high points come with Jon Stewart's sweet courtship of Gillian Anderson and a brilliant turn from a young unknown named Angelina Jolie.	It's overly talky, but Playing By Heart benefits from witty insights into modern relationships and strong performances from an esteemed cast.
Nanny McPhee? Nanny McPhooey is more like it.	Emma Thompson's smart script and the uncanny dignity she brings to her Mary Poppins-esque children's nurse make up for a lot of flaws.	There's nothing offhand or spontaneous-feeling about Nanny McPhee; it's a highly mechanical piece of work, and its potentially delightful details are wasted.	A fugly Mary Poppins meets Nanny 911 in this family comedy whose overly familiar elements still go down easily as if with a spoonful of sugar.	Thompson's the title caregiver in this witty, rollicking kids' movie that adults will enjoy, too.	A bit alarming at first, Nanny McPhee has a hard edge to counter Mary Poppins-style sweetness, but it still charms us and teaches some valuable lessons.
Yeah, I said it. Wreck-It Ralph compares with the Toy Story movies. It's the equal to those films in terms of joy, character, sweetness and, most of all, heart.	The movie's retro sensibilities will appeal to adults, while the colorful games and characters, as well as the simplicity of the story, will hold the attention of young viewers.	Powered by a standout concept delivered upon in winning fashion, this fun film serves as the most natural and effortlessly readymade animated feature for future franchise exploration since Shrek.	It's fun for awhile, but it's not a video game you'll come back to once you set down the controller.	"Wreck-It Ralph" blends poignancy and a piston-powered plot that revels in both visual inventiveness and a vaudevillian sense of timing.	Equally entertaining for both kids and parents old enough to catch the references, Wreck-It Ralph is a clever, colorful adventure built on familiar themes and joyful nostalgia.
This is a vanity project full of crude humor. It may or may not appeal to broad audiences.	Subversive, self-deprecating and sexist, it's a horror zonk-fest designed to blow a guy's mind.	Maybe it's possible for a director to make demon raping and urine drinking side-achingly funny, but that wasn't the case here.	Uneven yet sporadically hilarious, the film does a spectacular job at toying with the public personas of its prolific stars, but frequently allows their riffing to go on far too long.	...it's ultimately clear that This Is the End could (and should) have topped out at a brisk 80 or 90 minutes (including credits).	Energetic, self-deprecating performances and enough guffaw-inducing humor make up for the flaws in This Is the End loosely written script.
Borders on being as offensive and misguided as a slapstick version of Roots.	If nothing else, Bringing Down the House reminds us that Martin still is... one wild and crazy guy.	Bringing Down the House is a hilarious comedy about a brassy and bold African-American who helps renovate the lackluster life of a workaholic tax lawyer.	In this ill-conceived comedy of errors...racial stereotypes and bottom-of-the-barrel humor abound.	This is an early '80s Whoopi Goldberg movie.	Though the cast shines, they can't save this comedy, which is overly contrived and filled with outdated and offensive racial jokes.
Lakeboat requires its audiences to embrace it as lovingly as Mamet and Mantegna embrace its men, but it's a lot to ask.	Viewers learn that these salty guys have salty imaginations and that Mamet's a master at capturing their thoughts in discursive detail.	As drama, it's not much; as a meditation on language and storytelling, it's a treat.	A first-rate movie made from one of David Mamet's lesser plays.	This early effort is more a curiosity piece than anything else.	Though not much happens plot-wise, Lakeboat still has a lot to offer for fans of Mamet.
A sly, stylish blend of melodrama and suspense that's also a cunning commentary on the seductiveness and danger inherent in storytelling itself.	Narrative issues hold In the House back from being as great as it should be.	The result is endlessly playful, although the rules of the game, in Ozon's hands, could hardly be graver, and what can be at stake, in the act of storytelling, has seldom been more elegantly sketched.	The convoluted yet familiar narrative games become somewhat tiresome. The movie works best as a straight suspense drama about a frustrated teacher and his devious star pupil...	The director and the audience are drawn together as voyeurs imposing our narratives on what we see on the screen as we do when organising the world around us.	Dark, tense, and wryly funny, In the House is brilliantly directed by François Ozon and features fine performances from its talented cast.
Return to Me may win your heart, but it will probably try to stick it in somebody else's body.	[Hunt] chooses early emotional depth to fulfill later parts of the movie--a master stroke, as it turns out.	Not a horrible movie, but not a good one either.	The alluringly deadpan Duchovny can make no headway with Driver.	The film is largely entertaining, often sweet, occasionally even moving.	David Duchovny and Minnie Driver provide heart-warming romance and comedy in this solid debut by Director Bonnie Hunt.
At road's end, Harold and Kumar smells very similar to the shrine of its title, which is great before you bite in and way less appetizing after you've sobered up.	...fares a whole lot better than the majority of its stoner-comedy brethren...	A movie that is funny far more often than it flops, and one that - more importantly - challenges the Myth of the American Melting Pot.	A blissfully silly, character-driven road movie with impressive laugh-per-minute performance specs.	...this film is dreadful! Horrible! Terrible! Aaaarrggghhh!	The likable leads and subversion of racial stereotypes elevate Harold and Kumar above the typical stoner comedy.
Be afraid, be very afraid.	The film's comic philosophy might best be summed up this way: If you think it's funny seeing Sheen bang his head against a lamp once, then it's twice as funny to see him do it twice.	Scary Movie 3 turns out to be an odd combination of the old-fashioned and the hip. I found it too awkward a combination to be entirely successful.	If you're looking for anything other than a parody clipshow, you won't find it.	It's time to stop, I'm afraid.	Though an improvement over the second Scary Movie, the laughs are still inconsistent.
Old-form moviemaking at its best.	It's extremely well-made, even though all the guts have been sucked out in an attempt to make it politically correct.	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs, The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer.	The film will dazzle you with stunning camera work, superb acting and swordplay -- plus best of all -- a sublime script.	A preposterous, expansive and self-conscious attempt to resurrect the historical spectacular.	Though it may not reach for any new artistic heights, The Count of Monte Cristo is an old-fashioned yet enjoyable swashbuckler.
Though similar to Schindler's List, this riveting Holocaust drama, also based on a true story, features actors who throw themselves wholly into the violence of a brutal concentration camp as they practice a trade that could keep them alive.	The story has moments of great humanity and terrible brutality but comes off as a strange hybrid of espionage caper and concentration-camp movie.	Stefan Ruzowitzky's meshing of plot with debate is impressive. His film is compelling and clever.	Curt wit and intermittent humor allow dialogue to be one of the strongest features of this drama and each actor delivers lines with a truth rarely seen in cinema.	The moral dilemmas marshalled by Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitzky prove absolutely gripping, and the whole film is alive with style and intelligence.	The Counterfeiters is a gripping account of one prisoner's moral dilemma, superbly portrayed by Karl Markovics.
...a persuasive addition to the subgenre of bad-seed-horror films like "The Omen" where a creepy little kid wreaks havoc and murder on the lives of ill-equipped adults.	The problem with Orphan isn't merely that the film is idiotic--it's that it's also sleazy, formulaic and repellant.	Sets up a series of increasingly queasy taboo points and then proceeds to rocket-cycle over them.	This is the rare fright flick that is actually grounded in some genuine human emotion.	For the most part, Esther is an entertaining and solid addition to the Evil Child canon.	While it has moments of dark humor and the requisite scares, Orphan fails to build on its interesting premise and degenerates into a formulaic, sleazy horror/thriller.
May be humorless, paranoid nonsense, but its biggest failure is its inability to scare.	Musters all its strength to set up a purportedly true-life scenario about alien sightings, only to give itself away at every turn.	No, no, no, no.	Unfortunately, none of the subsequent noise is all that scary, and the striving for Paranormal Activity's buzz is shameless.	Olatunde Osunsanmi's big formal innovation tunrs out to be the split-screen pairing of patently bogus "archival" black-and-white video that shows alleged abductees undergoing hypnosis and color "reenactments" of same.	While it boasts a handful of shocks, The Fourth Kind is hokey and clumsy and makes its close encounters seem eerily mundane.
It's a hard film to resist.	Ellefsen and Nordin originated their roles on an Oslo stage, resulting in two lived-in character portrayals which lend this offbeat comedy a sweet sincerity.	Blessed with two fine, nuanced lead performances.	Heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on Petter Nćss' delicate, clever direction ... and a wonderful, imaginative script by Axel Hellstenius.	The film's brand of humor seems a bit too broad, and the quirks of its main characters aren't really all that endearing, instead coming off as irritating and tiresome.	Quirky without being overly cutesy, Elling is a gentle, warm comedy.
if there's one instance of the road to perdition paved with fat budgets and good intentions, it's Defiance, or, as I prefer to call it, Custersky's Last Stand in Belarus.	The words and characters look great on paper, but lose their authenticity on screen.	Defiance is not so much a cohesive film as a series of interchangeable, broadstroked scenes--a movie on loop.	An absorbing family saga, a thrilling combat movie and a backwoods epic that conveys the feel of a frontier-community-under-duress with the vividness of a John Ford classic.	Defiance is overly long and somewhat disjointed, dragging through an interminable second act that seriously impedes the film's flow and hurts the inspired performances.	Professionally made but artistically uninspired, Ed Zwick's story of Jews surviving WWII in the Belarus forest lacks the emotional punch of the actual history.
It's not a pretty picture, but it is a funny one, if you agree with Tanovic that all human behavior tends toward folly, cowardice, self-deception, corruption and hopelessness.	We learn absolutely nothing about the ideologies of these people or their reasons for fighting. They are virtually interchangeable...	Tanovic, himself a war veteran, expertly twists us within the dilemma while avoiding easy answers.	The writing is brisk and smart and this is one fine film.	An interesting foreign war movie featuring a nice balance between drama and humor.	Bleak and darkly humorous, No Man's Land vividly illustrates the absurdity of war.
Rock's brilliant skewering of Hollywood, celebrities and the fans obsessed with their every move results in one of the year's smartest, insightful and terrifically funny films of the year.	"Top Five" may be Chris Rock's biggest and boldest film as a director and writer, but a sharper, smarter, realer script would have made it far more than just a lazy, lightweight laughfest.	[Top Five] is a charmingly tough-knuckled expression of an artist's vision in a pure and classic mode. With Top Five, Chris Rock has made his Annie Hall.	The sweetest surprise in this raunchy comic ride is how artfully Rock lets down his guard. His confident, prowling wit as a stand-up has finally found its way to the screen, enhanced by a bracing vulnerability.	Top Five is hardly in the same class as Stardust Memories but it is still manifestly cinema, rather than filmed comedy, and the gags are often visually sophisticated.	As smart, funny, and trenchant as writer-director-star Chris Rock's best standup work, Top Five is a career highlight for its creator -- and one of the comedy standouts of 2014.
An amiable, engaging and personal film.	The drama/comedy balance is not played out well.	Feels kinda like a misguided after-school special for adults.	For romantic comedy, it is not particularly romantic or funny.	Often entertaining, mostly unsurprising, but ultimately rewarding	Often seen as a Waiting to Exhale with men, The Brothers is amiable. However, it feels superficial and somewhat of a retread.
V for Vendetta is undeniably engrossing, and it offers a scattergun of satire that takes in all sorts of oppressive government behavior.	Its ultimate message is that no one should be afraid of big-budget movies, no matter how daring they might seem.	V for Vendetta is provocative, exciting, funny, beautiful, disturbing, moving and stylish. In fact, I can't think of too many things the movies can do that V for Vendetta doesn't.	...a somewhat old-fashioned adventure flick, filled with action, humor, romance, politics, and the kind of swashbuckling that audiences hadn't seen in movies for many years.	V for Vendetta is not a movie of ideas so much as it is an idea mall. By the time you've gotten through it, you feel spent, loaded down and more than a little disoriented.	Visually stunning and thought-provoking, V For Vendetta's political pronouncements may rile some, but its story and impressive set pieces will nevertheless entertain.
Even though its ambitions sometimes get the better of it, the film succeeds often enough to make us grateful that, even in our MTV age, a director like Bertolucci is still willing to get on the mat and grapple with Personality and History.	This tension between the permissible and the forbidden, between exterior and interior, between the illusion of freedom and captivity, between light and darkness becomes the organizing principle of Bertolucci's spectacular epic.	...a big, beautiful film that suffers only from an indifferent transfer to DVD. ...its human drama and sheer spectacle manage to catch and hold our attention.	If there is such a thing as voluptuous detachment, Bertolucci and John Lone have found it. Lone's achievement in his absorbing account of Pu Yi is to place him at a distance and yet make his plight totally involving.	As coolly lavish an epic as we may ever see.	While decidedly imperfect, Bernardo Bertolucci's epic is still a feast for the eyes.
The ignominious ending to a once-great television phenomenon. Possibly Lynch's worst effort to date.	For those who are willing to go the distance with Lynch, the return trip to Twin Peaks is well worth the trouble.	A fascinating tightrope-walk: Lynch's ultra-cool unconventional storytelling techniques are modified just enough to allow the movie to reach a broad audience	In its own singular, deeply strange way, Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch's masterpiece.	As much an essential missing piece for audiences of David Lynch's groundbreaking 1991-'92 television series ("Twin Peaks") to gain closure as a stand-alone film, "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me" is an alternately funny, harrowing, and bizarre experience.	For better or worse, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is every bit as strange and twisted as you'd expect from David Lynch.
The uplifting meandering piece on the likable eccentric filmmaker, Varda, is self-reflective, poignant and heartfelt.	a film that acknowledges time and age without completely giving into their grim results.	The kind of film that will make you feel better about cinema, humanity, and life itself.	Varda recalls her childhood, her adulthood, her politics, and how both her films and her two children were born. She doesn't just show us, she takes us inside of it all, inside of her. It's a reverie.	Varda turns the camera on herself and her own life, even though she convincingly posits that she's much more interested in other people.	An enchanting self-portrait by a veteran director, Beach of Agnes is equal parts playful and profound.
Its computer sequences exist in a blue-gray scheme filled with flashing lights, speeding objects and dizzying motion. Its visual effects are wonderfully new. They are also numbing after a while.	Tron looks almost as startling as it did when I was much shorter, largely because the designs by Moebius and Syd Mead complemented the austere style of early CGI.	One of those rare movies that manages to be silly and cool and important all at once.	Seeing it is like spending two hours in a hardware store gussied up with streamers and flashing lights. It's different, but it's not entertainment.	There's an undeniable cart-before-the-horse aspect to Tron...but Lisberger's film will always stand as a touchstone in the development of CGI as a storytelling tool... [Blu-ray]	Though perhaps not as strong dramatically as it is technologically, TRON is an original and visually stunning piece of science fiction that represents a landmark work in the history of computer animation.
This documentary is ragged and a little self-regarding. The stunts veer towards heavy-handed.	It's less a documentary than filmed performance art, barely concealing horror at capitalism's death wish.	The film is entertaining in its own right, and thought-provoking. Why don't more people quickly see through their hoaxes?	Forget about "Bruno" or "Borat". This is the real deal when it comes to exposing the phoniness of those in positions of power.	It takes some nerve, not to mention diabolical intelligence and financial resources, to pull off the elaborate pranks devised by the Yes Men.	The Yes Men aim their barbs at the capitalist fat-cats with gutsy and hilarious performance pranks.
Though Godard has often mixed avant-garde technique with conventional narrative in the past, here there's a firm line dividing the two modes from one another, and it makes the film much more cohesive, but a bit less intoxicating.	Godard locates the heart of the world in that divide, that moral schism. The movie then asks, without answering, Can it ever be repaired?	stuffed full of ideas, artfully crafted and thoroughly engrossing	An intensely felt, quietly beautiful elegy to 20th-century Europe -- to the Europe of wars -- and to the human need to create enemies.	Marries a banal message with a directorial technique that's now more sclerotic than innovative.	A dense, but thoughtful meditation about war by Jean-Luc Godard.
The Brave One is worth seeing for the scenes between Terrence Howard and Jodie Foster.	In Jordan's hands, the film becomes a tormented trip into a nightmarish world of murky darkness and neo-Expressionist camera angles.	A violent action movie with a heart and soul. Watching it is difficult; forgetting it is more so.	A true shocker that will shatter your nerves and get you talking.	Kill 'em Jodie.	Magnetic by between Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard can't quite compensate for The Brave One's problematic and unconvincing eye-for-an-eye moral.
A powerful portrait and provides more than enough material for someone like me who knew nothing.	The story of the Congo and its struggle for independence from Belgium is a bloody and torrid one, but Lumumba doesn't really imbue the tale with much spirit.	One day, when Ebouaney is a huge star, people will look back at this film and say 'That's what did it.'	A great film and a great performance.	Too many meetings and 'important' events, not enough of Lumumba himself.	Ebouaney's fiery performance makes Lumumba compelling.
Tries hard, but the routine feels a little too familiar. It's like getting a trim when what you really need is a new style.	Barbershop 2: Back in Business is the second episode of a big-screen sit-com. It may be three times longer, but it is also three times funnier.	Even when it falters, Barbershop 2 is sharp and hilarious.	It never strains, even though pulled muscles are a common sequel injury.	A sequel that sacrifices the chat for storytelling -- following exactly the wrong vein of raw materials.	The humor is less sharp and more warm-hearted this time around, and the characters are enjoyable to revisit.
The movie may be stylistically visceral, but it's aesthetically corrupt. It might as well have been called Pump Up the Violence.	A hall of fame guy's movie...[with] a macho '90s ensemble eclipsed only by Glengarry Glen Ross...the monologues--oh, the monologues! [Blu-ray]	The movie is exciting, thanks to the script, but when it comes to the bullet-ridden showdown, Scott shows it in fast cuts, without giving us a perspective of the action or the space. It's ruined.	The movie has a kind of goofy charm.	...a pulpy good time that holds up remarkably well two decades after its theatrical release...	Fueled by Quentin Tarantino's savvy screenplay and a gallery of oddball performances, Tony Scott's True Romance is a funny and violent action jaunt in the best sense.
Despite having almost as much ick-content as the last film, The Hills Have Eyes 2 hasn't the skill to make it unnerving.	a film as bloodily pointless as the current conflict in Iraq that it so unsubtly allegorises.	Helmer Martin Weisz, whose background is largely in musicvideos, meets the challenge of creating dread in broad daylight, before the entire cast of soldiers and carnivores heads underground, into the warren of mines and tunnels where the mutants dwell.	A sequel to a remake that's surprisingly intelligent and original, and it proves to be a worthy successor to both Alexandre Aja's 2006 Hills and Wes Craven's 1977 original.	Director Martin Weisz does an adequate job of maintaining the movie's tension and momentum, but the lack of compelling characters and the unusual level of nastiness makes this an arduous mission for all involved.	The Hills Have Eyes 2 is a completely unoriginal sequel offers plenty of gore and clichés, but few scares.
Has enough visual panache to compensate for the static, conversational nature of the work.	Well-orchestrated and superbly acted. Though we know the outcome, the fate of Paris seems anything but guaranteed.	The principal suspense in this fascinating movie is generated by the polite, and then not so polite, ferocity of the arguments between the two men.	Based on the French play by Cyril Gely and directed by Volker Schlöndorff's Diplomacy is so soundly engineered and acted that it doesn't seem stagey at all.	Gert Fröbe and Orson Welles played the same parts in René Clément's sprawling epic, Is Paris Burning? (1966). But this is superior in every regard.	For filmgoers who value character development and smart dialogue over plot, Diplomacy yields rich, powerfully acted rewards.
Sometimes -- albeit not very often in the movie world -- three really is a charm. ... Soderbergh gets lucky and comes up with a real winner.	This is more like it.	Evocatively shot with the saturated color of '60s film and accompanied by David Holmes' retro-mod score, Ocean's Thirteen is a boy's-night-out lark that girls can enjoy.	...an airy entertainment that has the smarts to add a second, unexpected swindle that is more satisfying than the main event.	Soderbergh can no more put the fizz back in his flat bubbly than one can put a genie back in a bottle, but at least Ocean's Thirteen can still give you a light buzz.	Ocean's Thirteen reverts to the formula of the first installment, and the result is another slick and entertaining heist film.
Everyone Says I Love You won me over completely.	Modern musical will not interest teens.	Much of the film's story is half-hearted, its jokes hit or miss, and what starts out feeling genial ends up unavoidably thin.	It would take a heart of stone to resist this movie.	Styled as a romantic confection, Everyone Says I Love You is, in fact, steeped in an unacknowledged middle-aged sadness that leaks from the writer-director and saps the energies of his cast.	A likable, infectious musical, Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You is sometimes uneven but always toe-tapping and fun.
This jolting jigsaw puzzle of a movie grabs you and won't let go.	It's a film that leaves you saying 'Wow' and 'So what?' at the same time.	Film noir has never been so labyrinthine.	"Memento" is a crime-revenge story that relies on its one big gimmick.	Memento is a puzzle of a movie... worth solving.	Christopher Nolan skillfully guides the audience through Memento's fractured narrative, seeping his film in existential dread.
Seems happily, deliberately second-rate, as if its ideal audience consisted of weary airline passengers.	It misses so many genuine opportunities for comedy that it becomes another reminder of writers not doing their homework and slapping together a paint-by-numbers plot.	What makes it a good movie ... is Bullock herself in a strong role that appeals to the feminist in me.	Tapping inner reservoirs of comedic talent that even her fans probably weren't aware of, Bullock hits every joke out of the park.	A barrage of dangling plot strands, inconsistent characterizations, and suspense-free shootouts.	Though critics say Bullock is funny and charming, she can't overcome a bad script that makes the movie feel too much like a fluffy, unoriginal sitcom.
Provides sporadic laughs, but not as consistently funny as the first one.	Amusing even if the law of diminishing returns is starting to kick in.	This is strictly a hit or miss film.	A real step down after the brilliant movie and TV show.	Filled with slapstick antics	The slapstick antics of this sequel provide a few laughs, but fail to equal those of the original.
One of the great ones	A grimy film that perfectly reflects its grimy subject matter. Travis Bickle [is] one of film's most complex characters. When you talk about super heroes, he truly is one minus the tights and powers.	Bickle is complex, intriguing and never one-note.	Scorsese's masterpiece of urban alienation...	Get in and take a nightmare ride on perhaps Scorsese's best picture, the story of Vietnam vet Travis Bickle's fight to win the woman of his dreams in the seedy Big Apple.	A must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best.
A grand- scale effort that's more awe-inspiring than completely successful as entertainment.	Batman is transformed in to Flesh Gordon with a phallic bat mobile, Bat nipples and sexual chemistry with his young ward...	Mildly diverting, brainless fun that feels like a long trailer for a better film.	Schumaker proves that someone CAN make a Batman movie even worse than Burton. Val Kilmer's portrayal of the Dark Knight is stilted and lifeless.	By now, Jim Carrey is doing sarcastic takes on his own sarcasm, and there's something funny and a little scary in that.	Loud, excessively busy, and often boring, Batman Forever nonetheless has the charisma of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones to offer mild relief.
A fascinating work that leapfrogs its maker, Richard Linklater, from acclaimed indie filmmaker to visionary.	Linklater commits not only to attractive images and thoughtful ideas, but images that are exciting in a way that is different from what we have seen before.	Forces a non-stop barrage of pseudo-deep theories and questions on the viewer that, more often than not, resemble a bunch of psycho-babbly hooey.	Explorar estas preguntas, y hacerlo de una forma tan grata en lo visual, es una forma de expresar júbilo, gozo por la vida, ...y por el cine y la animación.	Even without the animation, Waking Life remains a living, breathing entity, full of real thought, conversation and ideas.	The talky, animated Waking Life is a unique, cerebral experience.
Depressing rather than uplifting; it does not offer catharsis-that relief or discharge of the sadness that would arise out of new understanding or insight.	An extraordinary film!	One of the most insightful and wrenching portraits of the joys and tribulations of being a classical musician ever filmed.	Eye-grabbing performances from Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths, who portray celebrated British cellist Jacqueline Du Pre and her older sister, Hilary, distinguish this ambitious but flawed biography, the debut feature from Anand Tucker.	Emily Watson as Jacqueline Du Pre and Rachel Griffiths as her sister Hilary are wonderful together!	Brilliant performances, lush cinematography, and complex storytelling deserve audience's attention.
It's the detail -- the fly on the dead man's face and all those close-ups of characters' stirruped boots clanking on wooden floors -- that makes The Salvation so enjoyable.	It's disappointing that the movie, which begins with such a strong sense of moral murkiness and casual injustice, descends into a rather generic tale of revenge...	A film reminiscent of a song that sounds familiar but offers its own pleasures.	"The Salvation" is one of those movies that deservedly (and desperately) requires a do-over. Unfortunately, what you see is what you get.	Mikkelsen in a Danish Western holds promise, but computer-aided style detracts and distracts	It's all but impossible to add anything new or fresh to the traditional Western, but -- thanks in no small part to Mads Mikkelson's performance -- The Salvation comes close.
An amusing trifle.	Mamet's movie has its moments of wit and warmth, but here he's mostly behind, not ahead of, the curve.	retains a lightheartedness that pokes fun at the film industry and gives some memorable performances	This is sitcom the way sitcom is meant to be.	It's Mamet in a lighthearted mood, playing with dialogue, repeating phrases just because he likes them, and supplying us with a closing line that achieves, I think, a kind of greatness.	State and Main offers plenty of wit and laughs in its lampoons of the movie industry.
If you have to watch a movie this miserable, it helps enormously to have Angelina Jolie as its eponymous lead.	More sex, more exotic locations, but still no decent story.	Joyless princess.	Action-packed.	Em uma entrevista para divulgar o filme, Angelina Jolie reclamou que o contorno de seus mamilos haviam sido apagados dos cartazes de divulgaзгo da produзгo. Da prуxima vez, espero que ela se preocupe menos com seus mamilos e mais com o roteiro.	Though the sequel is an improvement over the first movie, it's still lacking in thrills.
[A] visceral and deeply moving true story ...	The Orphanage director JA Barona deals in a different sort of horror in this wrenching account of the lethal tsunami which struck the Thai coast at Christmas 2004.	Juan Antonio Bayona's The Impossible is an emotional tale of hope and survival, shot with an unafraid eye for disaster and tragedy.	With a mixture of practical and digital trickery, we experience the unthinkable in "The Impossible" firsthand.	This film is not especially complex, and not subtle, but there is judgment and intelligence in the simple idea of survival being the most agonising thing, and making survivor guilt the psychological aftershock of a shattering and irreparable blow.	The screenplay isn't quite as powerful as the direction or the acting, but with such an astonishing real-life story at its center, The Impossible is never less than compelling.
The Fisher King is a disorganized, rambling and eccentric movie that contains some moments of truth, some moments of humor, and many moments of digression.	With director Terry Gilliam at the helm, Robin Williams actually succeeds in a drama.	The Fisher King's problems begin with Richard LaGravenese's screenplay and are amplified by Gilliam's showy direction and an unbearably fey performance by Robin Williams.	Visually impressive, frequently pretentious, and extremely fluid as narrative (the 137 minutes sail by effortlessly), this mythic comedy-drama presents Gilliam as half seer, half snake-oil salesman and defies you to sort out which is which.	A modern epic that fuses myth with hard-edged reality, it's a one-of-a-kind, thoroughly engaging experience.	An odd but affecting mixture of drama, comedy and fantasy, The Fisher King manages to balance moving performances from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges with director Terry Gilliam's typically askew universe.
A definitive portrait of a real-life travesty of justice. Provides a strong sense of the scope of this tragedy and a thoughtful investigative probing of the facts behind it.	It's nice to have all the twists and turns of the iconic case contained tidily in one well-crafted film, although there are no real revelations here.	[It is] about the weighted scales of US justice, and amounts to a fight for fairness: when you have to settle for the best redress a corrupt judicial system can give you, it may be time to clean house.	"West Of Memphis" brings enough to the table to stand alongside "Paradise Lost" as a nuanced, powerful look at a miscarriage of justice...	The intelligent storytelling, wise use of access and emotional depth that separates West of Memphis from other documentaries about the murders in Robin Hood Hills, also elevates it to required viewing.	Both a sobering look at a true crime story and a scathing indictment of the American justice system, West of Memphis is a real-life horror story told with fury and compassion.
Fittingly for a movie featuring lots of great soul music, The Sapphires is filled with soul and sings from the heart.	It's a sweet little tale, and that co-writer Tony Briggs is the son of one of the real-life singers adds to the heart-tugging. In the end, though, it's not quite enough to sustain a feature-length film.	The Sapphires is a jukebox musical in every sense of the word; all the hits, none of the deep cuts... thankfully the wonderful performances convince us that a Best Of package, though often lacking in substance, can still be a whole lot of fun.	If you love the music of Motown and enjoy a feel good success flick, then "The Sapphires" fits the bill.	It might not possess the exuberant innocent fun of 'That Thing You Do!' or the overall brilliance of 'The Commitments' but 'The Sapphires' shines enough in its own right. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)	While it's plenty predictable and sentimental, The Sapphires also has an irresistible feel-good vibe, winning music and charming performances to spare.
A decent, cogent, greyly atmospheric thriller with something to say about War-On-Terror America.	It's rare to find a film that really works on all levels, but that's exactly what Denis Villeneuve's has constructed with Prisoners.	The final third has more in common with three-card monte street hustle than nuanced character drama.	Too much of brilliantly good thing. It's like watching the director's cut that goes a bit deeper into the character development and filled with scenes the filmmakers loved, but realized weren't essential for the final cut.	All these nagging little problems, plot holes, inconsistencies, are a bother, but the overall strength of the film overpowers these things.	Prisoners has an emotional complexity and a sense of dread that makes for absorbing (and disturbing) viewing.
If you're looking for comedy to be served up, better look elsewhere.	The movie itself is a cattle ranch full of joke droppings and mooing shtick not worth stepping in.	Lame, limp, unappealing, incompetent, clueless -- these are the kindest words I can come up with to describe this film.	...Designed to appeal to moviegoers whose goal is to sit in an air-conditioned theater for 1 1/2 hours with their brains on 'pause.'	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed, haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining.	A romantic comedy that's neither funny nor particularly romantic, Serving Sara is a forgettable time waster.
Underneath its typical Hollywood exterior there is a decent movie waiting to shine through. But so much else is just typical of the genre, it's hard to summon any more enjoyment from it.	Yetta nudder cautionary tale issuing dire warnings about the pitfalls of technology run amuck.	A film about robots that might find its biggest fans among Luddites, Surrogates is an intense and eerily plausible sci-fi thriller.	Surely Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick and Stan Winston must be tossing in their grave for what all their creative and innovative ideas have wrought.	If the whole point of this surrogate society is to appear as a perfectly beautiful avatar, why would Bruce Willis choose that ludicrous blond wig that looks like he plucked it off a mannequin at Boscov's?	Though it sports a slick look and feel, Surrogates fails to capitalize on a promising premise, relying instead on mindless action and a poor script.
This is a safe, edgeless cinematic after-school special.	Even for an ugly-duckling-makes-good fairy tale, Ice Princess seems to stretch believability a tad too far.	A film about teens discovering and pursuing their dreams. It's an oldie but a goodie as far as film ideas go.	The movie does have a strong sense of the special charisma and beauty of these young demons of grace who ride the thin line between dance and sport with unerring precision.	The delight of Ice Princess is that there's more to every character than meets the eye.	This likable Disney film gets points for effort, but can't stick the landing when it comes to originality.
This summer's designated Sundance crowd-pleaser, Rocket Science, is a quirkily disarming high-school comedy that calculatingly follows in the footsteps of Napoleon Dynamite, Election and Rushmore.	If Napoleon Dynamite and Rocky had a kid and placed it in New Jersey, it would be the delightful and fresh Rocket Science.	A special little picture that resonates long after it's over.	Honest and surprisingly lucid at its core.	...a quirky coming-of-age story (is there any other kind these days?) full of wry Wes Anderson-style humor and maladjusted misfits.	Though Rocket Science appears to be a typically quirky indie, the well-rounded performances and director Jeffrey Blitz's clear affection for his characters gives the film its proper human spark.
How to turn an innocuous comic strip into an obnoxious movie.	Very young children may find the numskull, by-the-numbers gags here amusing, but teens will consider this kids' stuff and adults will be pained.	But it's all far too flabby, with lengthy setups that seem to go on forever. Some judicious editing to tighten up the film could have made all the difference in the overall pacing.	A smooth blend of sentiment and slapstick.	Someone ought to pay for this.	Walter Matthau does a nice job as Mr. Wilson, but Dennis the Menace follows the Home Alone formula far too closely.
Creative exhaustion haunts Ice Age: The Meltdown, as the characters from 2002's Ice Age face global warming and the submersion of their valley.	The Meltdown is less a story than a series of complicated slapstick bits -- the physical gags are often enjoyable, but there's not much else to the movie.	The animation is beautiful, with the flowing water and icy cliffs perfectly rendered.	For whatever it lacks in the way of a compelling story, Ice Age: The Meltdown still manages to give family audiences what they want and expect: lovable characters, gorgeous computer-generated animation, and laughter.	Leguizamo's wispy voice work shows that creating compelling animated characters takes more than just placing a sitcom star in front of a mic. Yes, I'm looking at you, David Schwimmer.	Despite its impressive animation and the hilarious antics of the saber-toothed squirrel Scrat, Ice Age 2: The Meltdown comes up short on the storytelling front.
Call Me Kuchu leaves you flabbergasted by its portrait of the persecution of gay men and lesbians in Uganda.	It will be alarming to many to see how easily hatred is stirred up by local media, but also rewarding to see that Kato's fight for his own human rights has been ably captured for posterity.	A heartfelt human rights gem that exposes anti-gay hatred in Uganda.	With this heartbreaking premise, directors Malika Zouhali-Worrall and Katherine Fairfax Wright directed Call Me Kuchu, a revealing documentary that takes a look at how a small group of people are working hard to take Uganda out of this dark ages.	[A] portrait of a courageous LGBT community partying, organizing, laughing and weeping as it fights for its life.	Alternately horrific and uplifting, Call Me Kuchu exposes heinous systematic brutality with a clear eye and admirable precision.
It does not dwell on the sex in a lurid manner, but neither is it judgmental toward porn makers.	You'll need to swallow your preconceived notions, but I would not hesitate to recommend the film to just about anyone.	Os diрlogos sсo afiadьssimos, e Paul Thomas Anderson permite que seus atores se sintam livres para interpretar, sem preocupaушes com questшes tжcnicas.	Boogie Nights never exactly recovers the tightness of its first hour, but it certainly doesn't descend into permanent disorganization as some critics have charged.	I'm not sure all of this works out as convincingly as Anderson intends in the movie's somewhat unsatisfying ending, but getting there is a wickedly enjoyable journey.	Grounded in strong characters, bold themes, and subtle storytelling, Boogie Nights is a groundbreaking film both for director P.T. Anderson and star Mark Wahlberg.
It looks like the characters of color in Percy Jackson have been paired off, a remarkable choice in a movie that is, in essence, about the glories of half-breeds.	Not bad, but JK Rowling can rest easy.	The technical wizardry is spectacular and the story is taut, pacy and consistently inventive.	Columbus directs with his usual frying pan to the head. Music is forever swelling majestically. Characters are always opening wide their eyes and mouths to gaze in wonder.	An awful lot of acting talent goes to waste in this film, but there is barely enough here to marginally satisfy the younger set.	Though it may seem like just another Harry Potter knockoff, Percy Jackson benefits from a strong supporting cast, a speedy plot, and plenty of fun with Greek mythology.
Denis continually references the dreamlike non-reality of the situation, which makes the experience feel more private and personal.	An intensely, yet sensitively, realized account of a one-night stand, [that] masterfully builds tension as it shows us its protagonist's very subjective point of view.	A daydream of a movie cast in nightshade.	Friday Night never makes the leap from a little fantasy about sex with a stranger to a larger story about a woman settling down for life.	Friday Night is slight in the same way fleeting thoughts are-it runs through our imagination quickly, but leaves a pleasing and lasting afterglow.	A dreamy, visually poetic film.
An experiment touching on intergalactic irony and the deepest inner disconnection, a work of telescopes and microscopes	The real stranger from another planet is Nicolas Roeg.	Feels like a tedious historical artifact. It's a sci-fi "Days of Wine and Roses" for the arthouse crowd.	The film has turned out to be prophetic, and, in so doing, demonstrates one of the wonders of great films: their ability to mean different things at different times.	Though Roeg's special effects looked hokey even 35 years ago, some of the technological elements of the film have proven oddly prescient.	Filled with stunning imagery, The Man Who Fell to Earth is a calm, meditative film that profoundly explores our culture's values and desires.
Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible.	It remains a timeless classic: it blew my mind when I saw it as a kid, and watching it again 20 years later, I still adored it.	It makes us believe in magic again even as grizzled, cynical adults.	Oda a la inocencia de la nińez, la aventura de la juventud, la majestuosidad del universo y la magia que envuelve a los jóvenes de corazón.	Come 2022, I'm sure I'll be seeing it again with my kids.	Playing as both an exciting sci-fi adventure and a remarkable portrait of childhood, Steven Spielberg's touching tale of a homesick alien remains a piece of movie magic for young and old.
The arcs of the characters have the persuasive authenticity of real life, as do the dramatic mechanics of the big-game finale.	Not a rah-rah Remember the Titans-style tribute to the excitement of football. ... Even in the movie's happiest sequences, a sense of melancholia seems to be lurking nearby.	Berg's choice of intense closeups and handheld camerawork gives up the bigness of the game, but in exchange we get up-close-and-personal views of how the players see the game.	The movie shows the good, the bad, and the brutality of the sport... with all the chills and thrills that you need, plus some.	Boilerplate stuff, though livened by flashy editing and cinematography.	An acute survey of the football-obsessed heartland that succeeds as both a stirring drama and a rousing sports movie.
While all the acting is memorable, one always thinks first and mostly of Miss Swanson, of her manifestation of consuming pride, her forlorn despair and a truly magnificent impersonation of Charlie Chaplin.	This is the greatest film about Hollywood ever put on celluloid by Hollywood.	Arguably Wilder's best film.	A cynically dark recognition to Hollywood's forgotten stars.	Black comedy, creepy noir, and timeless Hollywood satire... as good as they come.	Arguably the greatest movie about Hollywood, Billy Wilder's masterpiece Sunset Boulevard is a tremendously entertaining combination of noir, black comedy, and character study.
Could certainly be a whole lot worse, and this is something I clung to as no uncertain comfort during the film's 104 minute running time that feels a good deal longer.	Yet another queasy entry into the ever-growing Queensploitation genre.	Rose-tinted it may be, but this portrait of Britain's longest-serving monarch never drags. Blunt and Friend secure your sympathy as the mutually adoring V&A, while Vallée sleekly braids the personal with the parliamentary.	An elegant, entertaining, informative picture with a gallery of vivid supporting turns, this provisionally crowns the winning Blunt as a Brit-pic star - but it skimps a bit on the bodice-ripping, blood and thunder.	A veddy proper film that wouldn't presume to misbehave with an ounce of unnecessary melodrama and abandon. We are amused and entertained but not terribly so.	Emily Blunt shines as Victoria in this romantic but plodding royal portrait.
An invaluable record of the media's role in a war that some analysts have likened to the 'quagmire' of Vietnam.	This fascinating look at the inner workings of the Al Jazeera Arab news network can't help but cause viewers to question everything we're fed by the media beast.	A perceptive picture of the way in which modern warfare has turned the information battle into its permanent second front.	The mood of Jehane Noujaim's bristling documentary about Al Jazeera, the satellite news network, is both frenetic and grim.	'The press, not war, is the necessary evil in Control Room and information is now more powerful than missiles.'	A fascinating, enlightening behind-the-scenes look at the Al Jazeera network.
Allen doesn't push the material as far or as hard as he might have.	This hit-and-miss effort is a bit like watching your favorite home-run hitter trying to play out his career on two bad knees.	Sloppily conceived.	There are just enough Woody sight gags and one-liners for this film to keep its head above water.	Small Time Crooks finds Woody Allen back in a comfortable comic groove.	Woody Allen rises from his recent slump with Small Time Crooks. A simple, funny movie, Crooks proves Allen still has the touch that made his name synonymous with off-beat comedy.
A good premise, hampered by a weak ending.	The movie is as smart as ``Mission: Impossible'' is dumb.	What it lacks in sophistication (everything), it partly makes up for in sheer gall.	[Sheen] spends most of the movie in a kind of sweaty apoplexy that makes one worry for his health.	Sheen is working outside of his element, but the energy he puts into his multidimensional character helps keep the story moving.	Stylish and inventive, The Arrival offers a surprisingly smart spin on the alien invasion genre.
The Trip To Italy ends abruptly, but for almost two distinctly pleasurable hours, the film lets audiences be third parties in Coogan and Brydon's dinner conversation.	British comedians and dueling partners Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are back in this witty and incisive follow-up to "The Trip."	It's a skimpy premise for a movie, but it works because the two men are just so darned funny.	...a stale rehash of its demonstrably superior predecessor...	Leisurely and sublimely sybaritic, filled with irrepressibly clever repartee	While perhaps not quite as fresh as Coogan and Brydon's original voyage in The Trip, The Trip to Italy still proves a thoroughly agreeable sequel.
The material is treated with such brutal honesty and the performances are so strong that it actually makes what should be stale material look fresh.	Moland brings to his film a sensitivity to the complexities of evolving relationships.	The near-perfect cast has talent to burn.	Moland ... has a fine eye for landscapes, but an even surer touch with actors.	For all its attempts at bending the rules, Aberdeen still comes off as frustratingly conventional.	Though the characters are difficult to watch at times, Aberdeen burns with ferocious honesty and strong performances.
Whatever one's qualms about the material, its execution here is rock solid in ways that keep on impressing, right through to the niftiest end credits sequence in years.	I wondered at times if these people had even seen the show, or if they were just working from the script and sheet music.	Though we might not normally think of Zellweger or Zeta-Jones as musical talents, both are sensational.	By the end of Chicago, just about everyone in it has razzle-dazzled someone, and so has the movie, which leaves you thrilled at how good it feels to see life, death, and girl power turned, once again, into a cabaret.	Come on, give me a break. Who wins a Globe for having passed Basic Dance 101? Chicago is a decent film, a real toe-tapper directed with much flair and performed with competence - but ONLY competence.	A rousing and energetic adaptation of the Broadway musical, Chicago succeeds on the level pure spectacle, but provides a surprising level of depth and humor as well.
The movie captures the feeling of silence, of timelessness, of contemplation, of spiritual discipline, of communion with God and the rejection of the material world.	This wondrously meditative documentary is an artistic portrait depicting solitude. The fact that there is no narration, no dialogue to speak of is remarkable in itself.	On a philosophical level, Into Great Silence emphasizes the virtues of the ascetic life, returning again and again to the idea of giving away all possessions in order to become a true disciple.	Simply put, the film goes on much too long. There's no real shaping of the story, no real structure to the documentary. What on paper sounds like it could be a fascinating prospect in execution turns out to be something of a snooze.	A sanctuary of silence, contemplation, respect and inquiry into a quickly vanishing tradition that helped build the world we live in. And it only requires 164 minutes -- hardly a lifetime.	A meditative, deliberately paced doc capable of absorbing patient viewers into a whole different world.
She screams. He chases. She runs. We yawn.	Gruesome enough; what it lacks is a distinctive revolting personality of its own.	If you're into this stuff, it's a fun, scary time.	Just needlessly ugly and unpleasant, not to mention Hollywoodized down to its muddy shoes.	It's as if they didn't know whether to do a faithful remake or a modernist departure, and the result is a dissatisfying middle ground.	An unnecessary remake that's more gory and less scary than the original.
Much Magic at Play in this "Cinderella."	Cate Blanchett is perfectly marvelous. Nothing steals a scene from her, except Sandy Powell's costumes and Dante Ferretti's production design, which are all kinds of wonderful.	There is a lot of dying early on and also quite a lot later on, when you will feel you are dying, of boredom, of ennui and, possibly, the full weight of the patriarchy, pressing down hard on your chest.	All concerned here really believed in this project and put a lot of love in it. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	It looks terrific. It's also faithful to a fault -- and that's exactly the problem, since it makes it on the dull, unadventurous side.	Refreshingly traditional in a revisionist era, Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella proves Disney hasn't lost any of its old-fashioned magic.
All of Kubricks films have generated controversy, but this one engendered outright hostility.	A tight-fitting example of a neo-classic.	It may not make for escapist viewing but cannot be missed by serious filmgoers.	Remains as unsettling and shocking today as the day it was released.	It demands thought, compels the attention, and refuses to be dismissed.	Disturbing and thought-provoking, A Clockwork Orange is a cold, dystopian nightmare with a very dark sense of humor.
Beautifully filmed silliness, and fetchingly acted tweeness.	Cassandra's flowery narration may prove a tad irritating for those not in the mood for such soapy operatics but this glibly engaging melodrama...at least plays to mature audiences wanting an alternative to the latest Hollywood blockbusters filling up our	Wise and moving adaptation of Dodie Smith's beloved 1948 novel.	A quirky and handsome family drama that nicely captures the pangs and pleasures of adolescence.	It has just enough charm to be watchable.	A handsome and charming adaptation of the novel.
A solid, classy, cannily constructed piece of entertainment which gets down to action almost immediately.	An especially fun movie and a rare instance of a sequel that not only equals, but even betters, its original.	Acaba sendo salvo pelo mesmo elemento que contribuiu para o sucesso do original: a dinâmica e a química entre Christopher Reeve e Margot Kidder.	Perhaps not as good as the first Superman, this one offers more action and laughs a minute.	This is first class entertainment with a little bit of everything thrown in for good measure.	The humor occasionally stumbles into slapstick territory, and the special effects are dated, but Superman II meets, if not exceeds, the standard set by its predecessor.
A terrible one-man-army action flick. The 2004 version is far more effective.	Marred by cheeseball sets and special effects, lame fight sequences, and some of the worst acting ever to disgrace the screen.	Often underrated comic-book adaptation that lacks the trademark skull logo but delivers the superhero presence that the Thomas Jane remake sadly lacks.	Destructive, reprehensible, and marvellous fun.	It maintained a tongue in cheek attitude toward all the violence and hokum, which made it comic book lite and easier to take.	Despite the seemingly indestructible Dolph Lundgren with a crossbow, The Punisher is a boring one-man battle with never-ending action scenes.
The ending is predictable, but the two stars are appealing, especially since Sandler actually tones down his usual obnoxious shtick.	A sparkling romantic comedy, the kind of picture that glides by so gracefully and unpretentiously that it's only upon reflection that you realize how much skill, caring and good judgment had to have gone into its making.	All the movie's tender moments ring false, especially since Sandler always looks like he's on the verge of cracking up, and ultimately the movie has less flavor than a supermarket wedding cake.	If you like a pleasant and predictable romantic comedy, then this is the one for you.	The Wedding Singer turns out to be an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes laughing at the past.	It's decidedly uneven -- and surprisingly sappy for an early Adam Sandler comedy -- but The Wedding Singer is also sweet, funny, and beguiling.
Graphic look into heroin addiction. Not for kids.	Unapologetic and hard-hitting, Irvine Welsh's controversial bestseller is brought to the screen as a dazzling assault on the senses.	A cocktail of scuzzy charm, nerve and despair that seduces and repulses in nearly equal proportions. It packs a jolt, all right. But it leaves you with a brutal hangover, too.	Trainspotting has its creative moments and sometimes it can be funny, but the viewer should be prepared for a downbeat experience and should expect to find himself some places he would never go of his own accord.	[Has] a wild cinematic style that suggests a lust for the new, the different.	A brutal, often times funny, other times terrifying portrayal of drug addiction in Edinburgh. Not for the faint of heart, but well worth viewing as a realistic and entertaining reminder of the horrors of drug use.
The Cool School is neither as lively nor as complete as it could be, but as an introduction to modern art, it's a fine freshman course.	What The Cool School does so well, through its color accents and black-and-white photography...is impart a sense of discovery.	...a fun, jazzy look at L.A.'s first real wave of modern artists	Makes the case that there's more than basket weaving and freeway driving going on in the seedbed of originality we know as the Great Basin of L.A.	Definitely proves that, contrary to certain opinions, Los Angeles is not a cultural wasteland where fine art is concerned.	A breezy and lively modern art documentary, revealing that LA is not a cultural wasteland when it comes to fine art.
Taymor tries a little too hard, neither breaking nor broken by the play, but ultimately losing the wrestling match. [Blu-ray]	[M]essy but thrilling... [B]rings a new perspective on the play, and a new appreciation for it, which is the best we can ask for the umpteenth adaptation of a centuries-old work...	[Mirren] is powerfully vibrant as a female Prospero: she commands the screen whenever she is on, which unfortunately is not all the time..interweaving of three disparate groups becomes disjointed and tiring, never comes together in a meaningful way.	The effects are dazzling, the cast is stellar, the play is timeless, the movie is wretched.	A movie that veers from ethereal beauty (its closing credit sequence, as a book of magic softly drowns in a dark sea, is a stunner) to mystifying cheesiness.	Director Julie Taymor's gender-swapping of roles and some frenzied special effects can't quite disguise an otherwise stagey, uninspired take on Shakespeare's classic.
Os intertнtulos e o excesso de flashbacks comprometem um pouco o ritmo do filme, mas, de modo geral, a aзгo й muito bem conduzida e os personagens, satisfatoriamente desenvolvidos.	Before The Hunger Games there was Battle Royale. The bloody spectacle of Japanese schoolchildren being forced into a sadistic game of "last man standing" packs an emotional wallop.	A vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone.	'Battle Royale' is another deeply flawed addition to the deeply offensive phenomenon of 'reality TV'.	Fukasaku's film maybe can't maintain the sheer exhilarating rush of its first thirty minutes, but it's an outstanding work nevertheless.	Battle Royale is a controversial and violent parable of adolescence, heightening teenage melodrama with life-or-death stakes.
Mind-altering drugs just might make it seem better than it is.	George Clooney dazzles and Jeff Bridges shines in a scattershot but often hilarious military farce.	The Men Who Stare at Goats makes [True Lies] seem like a sensitive and balanced take on American/Middle Eastern relations.	Strained and uncomfortably buffonish. Everybody (except Clooney) is mugging when they should've just tried acting. Real satire draws blood. This one nudges you in the ribs.	The closer you look at The Men Who Stare at Goats, the better you see that its shaggy coat is covering some pointed truths.	Though The Men Who Stare at Goats is a mostly entertaining, farcical glimpse of men at war, some may find its satire and dark humor less than edgy.
Brody ... gives the movie a comedic side that is jarringly out of place with the rest of the drama.	Loach distills transformative drama and subtle interpersonal revelations that rival the most elaborate epic productions.	The strength of this vibrant, stirring film is that it doesn't get sidetracked by trying to encompass a love story, and furthermore dares to end on a note that is decidedly bittersweet.	Reality is achieved in the acting ... not through some annoying shaky video camera work.	Loach's left-leaning social activism is at the service of a potent and touching story	Bread and Roses has powerful moments, but it also sometimes descends into preachiness.
The vibe is loose-limbed and fluky, and the gags have an extra snap that's recognizably Seinfeldian. If I believed in a sitcom afterlife, I'd swear the whole thing was cooked up by Kramer and George's dad.	Absurd enough to delight kids, overstuffed with verbal and visual in-jokes for grownups, it's a 90-minute joyride that barely pauses for breath. This is unquestionably the best movie that ever began as a bad pun.	Jerry Seinfeld returns to the mainstream spotlight with Bee Movie, which proves as awkward and ineffective as George Costanza's attempts to wear a toupee.	This is a beautifully animated, cleverly executed, warm and funny adventure.	Seinfeld's pleasingly idiosyncratic comic voice comes through in the haphazard, slaphappy storyline. [Blu-Ray]	Bee Movie has humorous moments, but its awkward premise and tame delivery render it mostly forgettable.
It's cute and sweet and funny.	It's a happy report that the preview's bark is far worse than the movie's bite. There is a Chihuahua brigade (fronted by Placido Domingo, no less), but thankfully no musical numbers. It's a modestly charming old-dog family film with few new tricks.	In the words of another famous talking dog, Beverly Hills Chihuahua looks like something for me to poop on.	Gosnell gracelessly walks us through cheap, generic talking dog material, while parents everywhere groan silently to themselves.	This anthropomorphic tale will likely please the kiddies, and the animal trainers and vocal talent are to be commended, but anyone over the age of twelve will be bored.	Despite hitting some sweet notes, Beverly Hills Chihuahua is little more than disposable family entertainment.
Genuine trash, tempered only by Verhoeven's disconcertingly cool, classical direction.	This is lowest-common-denominator moviemaking that definitely rings hollow.	Hollow Man is just that -- a hollow excuse for a movie.	Eye-popping visual effects ... become lost in yet another typical slasher movie.	An effects-laden exercise in mediocrity.	Despite awesome special effects, Hollow Man falls short of other films directed by Paul Verhoeven. This flick over time degenerates into a typical horror film.
A compelling piece of press criticism as it probes the media as terror's conduit of choice, spreading message and validating violence in the 1970s and today.	It's the death of radicalism (and the SLA's criminality, sure) that's being documented in this gripping, fascinating film.	Interviews with two former SLA members provide this recounting with much-needed depth.	Urban terrorism inspired by Robin Hood.	Fine as far as it goes -- a worthy lesson in counter-culture history and the rise of media hysteria.	Guerilla is a riveting documentary that chronicles in enlightening fashion the 1974 kidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst.
ybridio Cronenberg kai Monty Python poy san metallagmenos korios rokanizei tis basikes ormes kai tis laimarges taseis poy mas kleidonoyn stin apoksenosi kai ti monaksia	Tthose who reveled in such cinematic synapses as the eyeball being slit in Un Chien Andalou will gravitate toward this outrageous, and frequently hilarious, piece de film.	Curiosity seekers won't be disappointed... just sickened.	Director György Pálfi is a talent to watch with your fingers over your eyes, but he's also a proper filmmaker, fascinated by his characters' hereditary fetishes and finding consistently clever ways to surprise us with his camera.	Five-star direction, however, can only take you so far if your audience have followed their stomach contents out of the building.	Surreal and visually striking, Taxidermia is, at times, graphic and difficult to watch, but creatively touches on disturbing subjects with imagination and wit.
...a spare premise that's utilized to surprisingly positive effect...	You'd have more fun actually working in a restaurant. Probably.	The only things you'll find on the menu are rancid leftovers.	You can do gross-out stuff and be funny, but it has to have some decent dialogue and characters.	Despite its flaws, it really is a funny, witty, and suprisingly charming slob comedy	Waiting... is a gross-out comedy that is more gross than comic.
The Way is a worthy effort and a sign that Estevez may yet emerge as an excellent filmmaker.	Goes exactly where you expect it to - and yet this journey is worth the trip because the destination ultimately proves so moving.	The Way's honey-toned landscapes and shots of alfresco meals shared by international pilgrims at rustic albergues are enough to make anyone ready a backpack and head off on walkabout.	The Way is real personal cinema. It's an Estevez family project. But it's not a vanity project -- it's a spiritual legacy.	This is a quiet, warm film that some will find actually spiritual.	It may be a little too deliberately paced for more impatient viewers, but The Way is a worthy effort from writer/director Emilio Estevez, balancing heartfelt emotion with clear-eyed drama that resists cheap sentiment.
Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film.	With a marathon three-hour running time, Fast Runner may not be tundras of fun for everyone, but trust us, this snowy epic is worth its salt.	An experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment.	It's a masterpiece.	Demands to be seen by anyone who thinks cinema is not just a laugh, a diversion or a time-filler on a date.	Compelling human drama and stunning cinematography make The Fast Runner an absorbing experience.
The film grows more unsettling when it becomes apparent that the child killer Beckert is something of a child himself, forcing the audience into something beyond complicity, something dangerously close to identification.	Fritz Lang's M is one of the great philosophical films, primarily because its anger and message are not bogged down in pretentious overtones with crush the story of the film, rendering it almost unwatchable a second time.	Put simply, without M to show the way, there might have been no subsequent films in which a hidden killer unmasks the ills of the society around him	Fritz Lang's first sound film, his most chilling and provocative work, features Peter Lorre's greatest performance as a child molester and murderer.	A subversive film, or more simply a movie brimming over with the ferment of Lang's imagination at its height? You choose.	A landmark psychological thriller with arresting images, deep thoughts on modern society, and Peter Lorre in his finest performance.
Handles the subject of domestic violence with intelligence and compassion.	An extraordinarily truthful and piercing drama about spousal abuse.	These kinds of films are hard to keep out of your mind.	Harrowing, psychologically astute drama about domestic abuse.	Actors Laia Marull and Luis Tosar explore the intricate details of a relationship based on the laws of attraction and repulsion, in which the intellect is repeatedly devastated by primal passion.	Graced with effective performances, Take My Eyes compellingly explores the subject of domestic abuse while avoiding simplistic characterizations.
Hicks's shtick is so good and his life so ordinary that it's hard to escape the feeling that we might've been better off just watching a compilation of the groundbreaking funnyman's work.	One of the marvels of this documentary, and Bill's life, really, is that it packs so much in such a small window of life.	If you want to experience Bill Hicks' best cutting edge, controversial comedy and then decide for yourself if the praise he did receive was warranted, this documentary achieves none of that.	Details about his personal life and what drove him professionally are lacking -- maybe the result of the film requiring the co-operation of Hicks's family.	While many biographical documentaries reduce their subjects to museum pieces, American presents the erstwhile Goat Boy as a force of nature, as vital and essential as he ever was.	A treasure trove of archival material and interviews, American: The Bill Hicks Story is an exuberant celebration about a unique, sorely missed voice in comedy.
Everything you ever wanted to know about the dark side of human nature can be found in Orson Welles' smirking face	...one of the most robust and intelligent thrillers ever made, an incredibly effective mood piece, and a model of Old School craftsmanship and polish.	It seemed like the creation of a sensibility terribly old and wise, and most of all very European; it was the very essence of world-weary sophistication.	The movie's verve comes from the abstract use of a jangling zither and from squirting Orson Welles into the plot piece-meal with a tricky, facetious eyedropper.	By the very nature of its settings and story, there are occasional reminiscences of Lang and Hitchcock, but there is nothing borrowed or imitated. Stylistically, The Third Man is Reed's most impressive film.	This atmospheric thriller is one of the undisputed masterpieces of cinema, and boasts iconic performances from Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles.
Just plain dumb -- and not in a 'good-dumb' way.	Belongs on an old-time double bill, where it would satisfy, if only because we'd be into the second movie before we noticed that the first came up a bit short on laughs.	A goofy, pratfall-laden guilty pleasure.	A slight tee-hee of a comedy that, like a bargain wine, induces a wince on first sip but finishes well.	Another feeble 007 parody.	A tame spy spoof that elicits infrequent chuckles.
The Grudge lacks a premise. There are no rules, just scares and nothing else, and when the bottom drops out, there's nowhere to fall	If you consider sudden shrieks of music and pale Asian children the pinnacle of all things terrfiying, then The Grudge is your next favorite movie.	Finally, the key to making an Americanized version of a Japanese film is revealed: Let the original director call the shots.	Shimizu deveria ao menos corrigir os furos mais grotescos da trama - principalmente se considerarmos que vem trabalhando com o mesmo material há quase cinco anos.	THE GRUDGE is that annoying blend of genuine scares and really, really dumb people	There's some creepy imagery to be found, but not much in the way of logic or truly jarring scares.
The climax may side-step some awkward questions, and lack a killer twist, but romantics will be more than satisfied. Damon and Blunt should pair up again.	Accomplished filmmaking that features two highly attractive, talented leads, a healthy dose of sentiment, an intelligent script, and which takes you away for two hours from the quotidian worries and banalities of your regular life.	Now here's something you don't see every daya gripping, literate sci-fi film, full of thematic texture, emotional warmth, and existential complexity.	It's hokum, but it's entertaining hokum, mainly thanks to Damon and Blunt, who make an appealing couple.	[A] straight-ahead thriller that, when you stop to think about it, you'll actually want to think about it.	First-time writer/director George Nolfi struggles to maintain a consistent tone, but The Adjustment Bureau rises on the strong, believable chemistry of its stars.
If you can stomach Rodriguez's effort, fear not -- you'll be rewarded with Tarantino's.	Go, I say, and enjoy.	Tarantino's feature Death Proof is the better homage to grindhouse, while Rodriguez's feature Planet Terror is more a contemporary update of the old drive-in movie genre.	As an exercise in aging-movie-geek nostalgia, Grindhouse is a bloody good time.	At three hours, the movie can become a bit of an ordeal. I'd say pack a lunch, but if Rodriguez and Tarantino have done their job right, you'll be too grossed out to eat it.	Grindhouse delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache, improving upon its source material with feral intelligence.
Although the movie makes a case for its ending, taking you by the hand and walking you through the stink of all its red herrings, the effort is wasted. Ro sounds like roe for a reason, and the logic behind this film was fishy from the start.	While the story becomes dauntingly complex as it goes, the finale resolves its multiple mysteries seamlessly. Perfect Stranger is the kind of polished diversion that the big studios should deliver twice a month, but don't.	Everyone behaves like characters who are motivated not by emotion or logic, but the to and fro of a remote control or joystick.	A cheesy affair that casts so many baited lures that they tangle each other and don't hook you.	Reportedly, several endings were filmed; perhaps some of them make more sense than this one.	Despite the presence of Halle Berry and Bruce Willis, Perfect Stranger is too convoluted to work, and features a twist ending that's irritating and superfluous. It's a techno-thriller without thrills.
If Russ Meyer had made The Other Boleyn Girl, Anne and Mary Boleyn would have yanked some hair, scratched some eyeballs, walloped each other in their respective kissers, and the movie would have been all the better for it.	Hey, wait a minute, is the movie supposed to be this funny?	Apart from the close ups of the lead actresses in 16th century garb, this movie is recommended only to soap opera aficionados and lovers of corsets.	A genteel soap opera in which the sex and intrigue are so muted, so tasteful, that they practically blow off the screen in a scattering of dust.	Unsexy and not particularly good-looking.	Though it features some extravagant and entertaining moments, The Other Boleyn Girl feels more like a soap opera than historical drama.
The corn Kevin Costner cut down to build his baseball diamond in Field of Dreams has been used to make The Rookie.	Takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights.	Earnest to the point of blandness.	The conflicts here are familiar, but The Rookie presents them admirably and resolves them without sap overload.	At two-plus hours, The Rookie is a good 20 minutes too long, but for father-son teams waiting eagerly for the umpire's "Play ball!", it's an uplifting season opener.	A heart-warming sports flick, The Rookie greatly benefits from understated direction and the emotional honesty Dennis Quaid brings to the role of Jim Morris.
a series of individual bite-sized conflicts that would fit snuggly in a half-hour sitcom	You already know if you like this kind of thing or not. But if you do, there's little not to like.	This spinoff lacks the repartee and thought-provoking social commentary of the original and its sequel. Instead, we get dumbed-down characters and juvenile booty jokes.	It's a bouncy, funny picture that I enjoyed -- one that mostly eludes the perils of sequelitis and spinoff-itis, a lusty comedy about the importance of looking good and getting the right scissors in the right hands.	The story is for the most part useless and thin--the pilot of a failed sitcom.	Despite a strong performance by Queen Latifah, Beauty Shop is in need of some style pointers.
District 9 is the real deal. Hallelujah.	In this summer of gargantuan mediocrities, a modestly budgeted project with an actual idea in its head, and the wiles to manifest it onscreen, exploding heads and all -- that's something.	District 9 made me think, and it made me jump. This cool science-fiction thriller pumps up the tension to wow-factor levels.	District 9 is 2009's second hugely impressive sci-fi film after Moon. Both put fresh spins on well-explored concepts.	Best when it operates as yarn rather than as social commentary, even if it is filled with logical inconsistencies.	Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, District 9 has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic.
A stultifying blend of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, boot camp, and maybe The Blair Witch Project, Wrong Turn is profoundly less than the sum of its influences.	For a horror cheese-fest about six ill-fated teens on the verge of brutal maceration by inbred hick monsters, Wrong Turn is surprisingly worth the detour	The sole saving grace of Wrong Turn is its honesty. You get exactly what you expect -- blood, guts and people being taken to the killing floor. But just because it's honest doesn't make it good.	It entertained me for 'what it was.'	Schmidt makes us flinch the old-fashioned way -- by giving us a box seat to the unspeakable.	An unremarkable slasher flick that fails to distinguished itself from others of its ilk.
Depp finally breaks out of his years-long slump to remind us what a fine actor he truly is -- when he puts his mind to it. And, here, his mind is working 100 percent.	Black Mass has a familiar formula many have become accustomed to with crime films, but the surprisingly strong performance from Johnny Depp not only keeps matters intriguing but also allows you to appreciate the unsettling nature of the film.	Depp terrifies as dangerously violent real-life gangster.	Electrifying, mesmerizing, and filled with tour de force performances... instantly the best film of the year so far.	[Depp] festoons himself with bad teeth, an elfin nose, and malamute eyes with fascinatingly grotesque results. What's new, however, is that he doesn't seem content with just pleasing himself this time.	Black Mass spins a gripping yarn out of its fact-based story -- and leaves audiences with one of Johnny Depp's most compelling performances in years.
Superstar is, surprisingly, not awful.	"Saturday Night Live"-sketch-turned-film is slight -- and surprisingly enjoyable.	As SNL women go, only Gilda Radner seemed as willing to rib so much of herself for our pleasure.	In the higher middle of producer Lorne Michaels' cinematic oeuvre.	Much more enjoyable than the sketches on which it is based, and Shannon's performance is brimming with fun and energy.	Dumb script and flat jokes made this another SNL misfire.
Payne also understands what it has taken me most of a lifetime to comprehend: that the Schmidts of this world are not to be easily dismissed.	On balance, I recommend the movie both for Nicholson's performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life, but rarely see on screen.	Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy, hope and despair, About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness.	The film's ending is not entirely happy. It takes the good with bad, suggesting that Schmidt cannot make his dark world bright again, but also exposing a small glimmer of hope that, if we try hard enough, we can make our own, small difference. Payne, in b	An utterly believable and gut-wrenching portrait of Midwestern loneliness.	In this funny, touching character study, Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his career.
Absorbs you and dissects its tale of life, death, and re-birth with inventive force.	Filmmaking so sensitive and intelligent deserves its weight in honors.	Using the structure of Amores Perros, Inarritu takes his complex tale of hope and redemption and breaks it into a mosaic of emotional tiles that add up to more than the whole.	For a film with such a powerful story with such fantastic performances, 21 Grams falters under excessive editing and a mistrust of its material.	A non-linear, emotionally escalating collage of three lives on a tragic collision course, the film is blessed with innovative storytelling and raw, stellar performances.	Alejandro Gonzבlez Iסבrritu deftly weaves an uncommonly structured narrative with panache in 21 Grams, a stylish, haunting drama full of fine performances.
Disappointing horror film which fails to generate any suspense or horror and is occasionally downright laughable.	The only real mystery about this nineteenth-century Exorcist is what could have possessed Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek to agree to star in it.	There's a dark, abiding mystery at the center of An American Haunting, and it's how on earth major stars such as Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek were talked into appearing in this film.	Just a lot of loud noises designed to make you jump.	There's thunder and lightning and wall-to-wall music. But it still doesn't add up to much of a movie.	Well, it looks good. But wasn't it supposed to be scary?
I'd be lying if I pretended to understand what was going on half the time... but the movie has a kind of rotgut, visionary grandeur.	An exciting, fun, and hauntingly beautiful piece of fantasy filmmaking...	Intriguing enough to build hope that the trilogy's next two parts can make this a reverse Matrix saga: A series that becomes more clear and compelling as it goes forward.	An impossible-to-follow story crammed full of cursed women, wily bloodsuckers, Highlander-style warriors, vortexes of crows, incoherent fight scenes, and more music-video-inspired action than any one movie can comfortably contain.	Taps into its own cultural wellspring of downright weirdness. I'm not sure what the hell I saw, but I wouldn't mind watching more of it.	This Russian horror/fantasy film pits darkness and light against each other using snazzy CGI visuals to create an extraordinary atmosphere of a dank, gloomy city wrestling with dread.
It has its own peculiar naturalism, a kind of lo-fi, lovelorn charm.	The perfect movie for people who love music.	Astonishing...it cleaves through the conventions of the musical form, leaving the raw emotion but junking the showy glitz.	Pragmatically recognizing life's hardships while romantically yearning for something more gives Once a quintessentially Irish flavor, as well as a poignancy that's both hard-edged and heartfelt.	One of the movie's pleasures is that it keeps us asking what sort of love story will Once become?	A charming, captivating tale of love and music, Once sets the standard for the modern musical. And with Dublin as its backdrop, Once is fun and fresh.
The human frailty at the center of the story makes the jokes all the funnier. Holiday films are rarely as priceless.	In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Chevy Chase's family Christmas tree is a little full with a lot of sap, much like this movie. But it's a big-hearted fullness and it's a smoothly stirred sap.	hilarious, a classic	[A] fairly perfect blend... of cartoon violence and mayhem and the pleasant lightness of a Christmas movie.	One of the great unanswered questions in Hollywood is how Chevy Chase still gets work.	While Christmas Vacation may not be the most disciplined comedy, it's got enough laughs and good cheer to make for a solid seasonal treat.
Because of the potential of the idea and Cronenberg's reputation as a film maker, it's a real disappointment to watch eXistenZ fall apart the way it does.	This darkly sexual sci-fi horror variant by Cronenberg makes The Matrix look like child's play.	It's a pleasure to find the brooding Cronenberg turning out a trifle, even if it's a dark trifle.	Above all, it is a galactic leap from any other film you're likely to see this week. Or this month. Perhaps this whole year.	[Cronenberg is] a laughing existentialist here, a philosopher who sees the comedy in disorientation.	Gooey, slimy, grotesque fun.
Great band, great music, great film. Not only that, it remains a fascinating portrait of Britain on the cusp of change.	The deadpan humor and non-sequiturs are delivered with such dry perfection you often find yourself rewinding to see if you really heard what you think you did. (And you did.)	It's hard to estimate the effect the film had on the future of movies, television, and society in general.	This re-release offers a refreshed glimpse of a long-lost English Atlantis-and a farewell to it.	Richard Lester's innovative film, the Beatles' debut feature, is a timewarp memento of that brief 1963-4 phase in their history known as Beatlemania.	A Hard Day's Night, despite its age, is still a delight to watch and has proven itself to be a rock-and-roll movie classic.
A visceral, intimate drama.	"Last Resort" does not have the feel of a fictional piece, but instead appears to be unfolding as the events occur.	Thank goodness for the Shooting Gallery -- while Hollywood continues to churn out very little of interest, they rescue great little films like Last Resort from obscurity.	Fasten your seat belt, and don't blink for a second.	Writer/director Pawel Pawlikowski strikes a wonderful balance between pathos and tenderness.	Critics are raving about Last Resort, saying it's a convincing, touching tale. Particularly impressive is the lack of script during the film's shoot.
Nothing is sacred in this gut-buster.	Traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill.	(The film) uses the well-traveled conventions of racial stereotyping to make a grand little spy/action comedy.	A zany, simplistic, chaotic and outrageous comedy.	Malcom D. Lee is a consummate professional and has made a wise choice in how to approach this material, for a strong case could be made to use this as the initial tool in our school systems to begin serious discussions about race and class.	Fast-paced and filled with racial gags, Undercover Brother serves up plenty of laughs and sharp satire.
It's a familiar chain of events that resolves these issues, but where McCarthy veers from the mainstream is in his focus on the small lightbulb moments over the slow-motion slam-dunks that usually mark the reversal in fortunes.	A decent feel-good film, but I expected more from McCarthy.	As with The Station Agent and The Visitor, McCarthy creates a series of encounters for some astonishingly vivid characters.	While another actor might lose your sympathy, Giamatti effectively portrays the quiet desperation of a decent man on the edge, and it's his soul-searching turn that keeps you pinned to your seat.	Paul Giamatti turns sitcomish fare into a highly watchable dramedy.	Rich, wonderful characters and strong performances populate Win Win, with writer/director Thomas McCarthy continuing to emerge as a great American humanist.
Rarely has a message movie been as noxious ... manages to be not only contrived and culturally offensive, but also exploitative of the illicit practice it theoretically opposes.	A nasty, vile business, made more slimy because director Marco Kreuzpaintner doesn't trust the intrinsic interest of his story, and pumps it up with chase details, close calls, manufactured crises, and gratuitous scenes.	The story of the victims on the road is harrowing, but the tale of the kind cop and the teenager with an attitude is a string of big brother clichés.	A documentary about sex trafficking might have been more powerful. Dramatizing the subject in this fashion, with a race-against-time road trip, breathless online bidding and a couple of different happy endings, simply cheapens it.	Other than showing how a trafficking pipeline might work, Trade is a total misfire, a strange attempt at making a buddy movie featuring a morose Kevin Kline and a 17-year-old Mexican boy looking for his kidnapped sister.	With an exploitative style that seems more suited for TV shows like CSI, Trade's message about the reality of child exploitation is easily lost.
A tightly packed little snowball of a comedy that picks up steam as it rolls along.	A moderately amusing chronicle of one man's fight for his right to lethargy.	It's a strange and distant tale that would only appear on Jerry Springer in America but comes off as quirky and cute when presented from the cold Nordic perspective.	There's something juicily amusing about the nonjudgmental way Kormakur views his characters.	The film is almost too successful in its depiction of Reykjavík as the most boring spot on the planet.	A funny, offbeat romantic comedy about an unlikely tryst with the beautiful Icelandic landscape as a backdrop.
Grim in places, and at times gratuitous, this is still terrific five-hanky drama with top-flight technical work, horrifically spectacular action, subtle introspection, rich characters and a love story to die for.	Cold Mountain is . . . like a painting hanging in a museum. . .. It ignites your admiration, but fails to sufficiently seize your emotions.	Even though Minghella took quite a few liberties with the novel, he managed to evoke the haunting spirit inherent in Frazier's prose.	Minghella crafts a complex and entertaining two-and-a-half hours with a cast who play their roles perfectly.	Here is a privileged example of a talented filmmaker at the top of his game, abetted by a dream cast that's every bit as committed and passionate as he is.	The well-crafted Cold Mountain has an epic sweep and captures the horror and brutal hardship of war.
James Toback's Tyson is a documentary with no pretense of objectivity. Here is Mike Tyson's story in his own words, and it is surprisingly persuasive.	Merely functions as a disingenuous attempt to make him palatable to the mainstream.	A highly divisive figure tells his side of the story in a revealing film that still leaves too many questions unanswered.	[Mike Tyson] could hardly have wished for a more sympathetic protrait.	Hypnotic and ultimately incomplete.	A fascinating, emotional, and frank confessional from Iron Mike that sheds a sympathetic light on one of boxing's most controversial icons.
Seductive!	Consistently charming and delightful!	At two hours, the froth on the comedy starts to dissolve like foam on a latte left standing all day.	Ephron's updating of this material falls flat.	Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron's screenplay is adequately warm and funny, and the characters sufficiently charming, to draw audiences in to the unlikely but ultimately engaging love affair.	Great chemistry between the leads made this a warm and charming delight.
A gross-out fright movie.	Raimi's return to Evil Dead territory is proof that, respectability be damned, he can still whip up a slapstick splatterfest -- albeit a PG-13 one -- when the mood strikes.	Shamelessly resurrecting ancient horror standbys -- not just curses; seers and séances, too -- Raimi clearly enjoys being allowed to return to the unruly instincts of his Evil Dead trilog	Drag Me to Hell's PG-13 rating holds [Raimi] back from the all-out, blood-spraying gonzo insanity he reached with Evil Dead, but he still gets away with a surprising amount of gross-out gags.	It's the work of a filmmaker once again drunk on the daffy possibilities of horror filmmaking -- and determined to share that joy with his fans.	Sam Raimi returns to top form with Drag Me to Hell, a frightening, hilarious, delightfully campy thrill ride.
An appealing and entertaining package that makes up for whatever it lacks in perfectly polished sheen in exuberance and passion for its subject and message.	The acting's pretty decent	Here's a dramatic version of a familiar story with a contemporary spin and fantastic music.	I loved the music and I admired its good intentions. But there are just too many sub-professional touches for me to recommend the film.	Really, a musical would have been a much better idea.	While it features outstanding musical numbers, The Gospel reduces a series of worthy themes -- faith, family, forgiveness -- to soapy, banal clichés.
Dai's episodic treatment has the force of memory, equally embracing the beautiful, the bittersweet and the absurd.	It's a fanciful tale, but the message is sweet -- that the higher arts speak a universal language that transcends politics and ignorance.	[A] tribute to the transforming power of books.	Visually, Balzac is a jewel of a movie, with panoramic vistas of the lake on the mountain, framed in mist, where the villagers, in a haunting nighttime ceremony, float candlelit paper boats bearing the names of their dearly departed.	An awakening to literature and hormonal hunger.	This delicately told fable about the power of literature is a lyrical delight.
When people complain that Doomsday moves from one 'what the hell?' moment to another, they're overlooking the fact that that's pretty much the idea.	When the film's unspooling and we're watching Rhona Mitra drive a sports car through an exploding bus, we find ourselves in movie geek heaven.	Most fantasy-action films blow their budgets in the first half-hour, and limp home with their makeup smeared. Doomsday is unusually patient, smartly saving most of its fireworks for the later innings.	Soulless, impersonal and shamelessly derivative, this dime-a-dozen sci-fi garbage is such a depressing step down for Neil Marshall that one can hardly believe it was made by the same guy responsible for the rightfully acclaimed The Descent.	Neil Marshall shamelessly rips off elements from so many other action-packed, post-apocalyptic fantasies that you feel you've seen all this mayhem before - and you have!	Doomsday is a pale imitation of previous futuristic thrillers, minus the cohesive narrative and charismatic leads.
Its keenly observed set-pieces never add up to a larger picture.	Sharply written and confidentially directed, the feature debut of Dylan Kidd is the kind of character study in romantic cynicism that actors live for. (Campbell) Scott savors every word...	A skillfully made but ultimately annoying drama.	...Rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle.	Kidd says he wants the extras to act as a 'film school in a box,' but the overall effect is more 'it takes a village,' indie-style ...	The movie could have benefited from a more experienced director, but a great cast and script overcome any first time jitters the director may have had.
Sometimes the stories we think we know, the stories where we don't want to hear another word, turn out to be the most involving of all, the ones we in fact know the least about. So it is with "Last Days in Vietnam."	Riveting ...	Anyone who thinks history is dry stuff should see "Last Days in Vietnam" - and heed its lessons.	As great documentaries do, "Last Days in Vietnam" humanizes events that can seem merely factual in news reports and textbooks.	Piecing together the myriad and moving vignettes of perseverance and humanity... holds her focus and never succumbs to heavy-handed methods, allowing the participants and events to build the historical experience from the ground up.	As gripping as it is inspiring, Last Days in Vietnam offers a surprisingly fresh -- and heart-wrenching -- perspective on the end of the Vietnam War.
Compelling but dubious ...	Wonderful and not a little sad.	Mr. Landis, who lives in Laurel, Miss., and has operated under several pseudonyms, is the enigmatic core of a movie that becomes pedestrian only when the focus switches to a one-man crusade to expose him.	...Art And Craft is a intriguing depiction of counterfeit impulses (both wrongly perceived and irrepressible), immense talent gone awry and what lies behind the desire to create.	A documentary about Mark Landis, a meek, eccentric Southerner who donated hundreds of his forged artworks to museums but never tried to make money off them.	The spotlight it shines on an apparently troubled mind may strike some viewers as exploitative, but Art and Craft remains a thoroughly gripping glimpse into the life of a legendary art forger.
It's one bleak film, and its ending would make Kevin Spacey proud.	Though there's a memorable final confrontation in the protagonist's mind, and a heck of a closing, most of the film's second half isn't nearly moody enough.	Somewhat confounding, but utterly spellbinding.	The approach is not an especially deep one, and in Cure it's given more deliberation than it can bear.	A creepy, enigmatic bit of psychological terror that by its final ambiguous scene leaves you truly chilled.	Mesmerizing and psychologically intriguing.
The movie might be a bit more interesting if Davis had more to him than simply graceful gumption and victimhood, and if the spaces around him could be filled with something.	Director Gary Fleder does an end run around the genre's cliches, and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau plays with desaturated color and highlights for a rich period feel.	While never as trailblazing as its subject, The Express is a worthy addition to the lengthy canon of sports biopics.	Combines and surpasses both genres by virtue of its honest-to-gosh goodness.	The Express plays for our sympathy -- and wins.	This inspirational sports biopic set in the the civil rights era is interesting even for non-football fans, and features a great performance by Dennis Quaid as tough-but-fair football coach.
A sloppy and intermittently goofy flick, but it still holds enough charm, excitement and good humor to please quest fans.	Although the dragon is a fantastic early computer generated creation and must have cost a bundle to design, the film itself is too long, too slowly paced, and not very intelligent.	At the story level, Willow is turgid and relentlessly predictable.	Though children will mostly be enthralled by the spectacles, even they might notice the weak story protruding through the industrial magic.	There's a sunny feeling here that's impossible to deny: a warm, inviting tone unseen in more recent fare.	Good production value and decent special effects, but the story is too insipid and slowly paced.
Lower your expectations, because Tim Burton has created a great canvas, just not a great film.	An endless series of tedious set pieces, flat characterization, lethargic visual effects, a waste of raw talent...	The off-kiltered Tim Burton version of Alice in Wonderland might frightened younger children, confuse older ones and bore the adults.	...[Burton] made an Alice in Wonderland film that wasn't Alice in Wonderland. Kinda.	...an endeavor that's big on spectacle yet small on plot...	Tim Burton's Alice sacrifices the book's minimal narrative coherence -- and much of its heart -- but it's an undeniable visual treat.
Robert Altman's biggest success to date is also one of his least interesting films.	Although it is impudent, bold, and often very funny, it lacks the sense of order (even in the midst of disorder) that seems the special province of successful comedy.	As a savage comedy about man's rebellion in the face of death it has rarely been bettered.	Rollicking, biting, satirical classic is so 1970.	A battle against the idea that 'a war movie' had to be a serious affair.	Bold, timely, subversive, and above all funny, M*A*S*H remains a high point in Robert Altman's distinguished filmography.
A treat for fans of vintage horror cinema (in particular, the experimental giallo genre) and vintage sound gear, this stylish, darkly humorous thriller locks us in a claustrophobic studio in 1970s Italy for a paranoia ride.	Fans of Dario Argento and Mario Bava will appreciate the references. Even for newcomers, there are minor chords to enjoy. If only there were less screaming.	The narrative rule of thumb is show, don't tell, but this film does the opposite, to sinister effect.	That keen awareness of aural matters also allows director Peter Strickland to convey the engineer's deteriorating hold on reality with genuine subtlety.	Mesmerizing, but the images stand alone and incomplete.	Its reach may exceed its grasp, but with Berberian Sound Studio, director Peter Strickland assembles a suitably twisted, creepy tribute to the Italian Giallo horror movies of the '70s that benefits from a strong central performance by Toby Jones.
Disaster Movie is lazily written, insulting rubbish and it's unquestionably one of the worst films of the year. Avoid like your life depended on it.	It's quite frankly stultifying that Friedberg are Seltzer are ever let anywhere near a studio boardroom after having defecated out their previous movies, much less this one.	It's a merry, reckless mess, like a blender that gets revved up too high and spews everything out all over the countertops.	A woman a few rows in front of me at the preview chose to write 20 minutes worth of text messages, rather than watch the movie. Even though she was not paying, the price was clearly too high.	The Zucker/Abrahams movies were genuinely funny, at least some of the time. But this?	Returning to their seemingly bottomless well of flatulence humor, racial stereotypes, and stale pop culture gags, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have produced what is arguably their worst Movie yet.
A celebration of form over story	Only minor Burton, with hindsight on our side, and its chief merits and flaws are as one of the formative texts of superhero cinema.	Gloomy and not particularly entertaining	Nicholson's Joker is a villain worthy of a real superhero and Keaton's Batman gets to perform some cinematic superheroics of the first order.	...the yardstick by which all subsequent Batman movies are measured.	An eerie, haunting spectacle, Batman succeeds as dark entertainment, even if Jack Nicholson's Joker too often overshadows the title character.
Filled with hilarious incidents and clever one-liners.	One of Mazursky's few completely successful films.	Let me just say that Down and Out in Beverly Hills made me laugh longer and louder than any film I've seen in a long time.	Richard Dreyfuss in top form.	Paul Mazursky hasn't only remade Jean Renoir's sublime 1931 Boudu Saved From Drowning: he's yuppified it, inverting virtually every meaning until the film becomes a celebration of the crassest kind of materialism.	An enjoyable farce that relocates Jean Renoir's Boudu Saved From Drowning to '80s California, offering fine comedic performances from Nick Nolte, Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler.
Boring youth movies are the result of boring youth characters.	Like Naomi Watts and Sarah Michelle Gellar before her, Bell spends this Hollywood remake of a Japanese cult hit at an emotional dead end.	To add to the insult there isn't even some nudity . .	It would have been a lot scarier if the film's college kids, haunted by comrades who stare back at them from cyber-hell, looked like they had lives worth saving.	This techno-themed horror film isn't nearly as scary as watching your computer crash.	Another stale American remake of a successful Japanese horror film, Pulse bypasses the emotional substance of the original and overcompensates with pumped-up visuals and every known horror cliche.
This is one summer movie that is more about human drama.	feels more like a made-for-TV movie	Nearly a perfect film	Think of something with the heart and soul of a Conrad yarn, yet buttressed by very special effects and shrewdly packaged for devotees of the Outdoor Living Network	The storm itself has more personality than anything else on screen.	While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, this film suffers from any actual drama or characterization. The end result is a film that offers nifty eye-candy and nothing else.
Darkness Falls has some chilling scares and spooky scenes, but not enough of them to keep your interest -- or to reward all the effort the movie puts you through.	The best thing to be said for Darkness Falls is that it contains one decent piece of advice: Stay in the light. When the lights are on, after all, this movie won't be shown.	The tagline reads, "Evil Rises. Darkness Falls," but they clearly forgot the third caveat: "Slumber Ensues."	There's no bite to this.	Fangoria subscribers will spot shameless cops from The Haunting, The Fog, The Blair Witch Project and Jeepers Creepers, to name but a few.	A derivative movie where the scares are few and things don't make much sense.
The mysterious Syndromes and a Century welcomes viewers into a world of simplicity and strangeness.	No psychological or sociological interpretation is offered, but the lovely whole that slowly emerges has profundity precisely because of its inclusive reticence.	The fragmented images and dialogue have the feel of a nostalgic dream - one you will either groove to or sleep through.	an essential piece of cinematic art	Don't think of it as film. Think of it as a series of paintings that talk to each other, raptly and quietly.	Despite having little in the way of narrative, Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Syndromes is a poignant and mesmerizing memoir.
The film will have to settle for a bogey rather than a par.	Francis Ouimet's story is a good one, and The Greatest Story may ultimately give golf films some much needed credibility.	The Longest Movie Ever Made.	It's not easy to find a movie that both Horatio Alger and Happy Gilmore would endorse wholeheartedly, but the true-life golf story The Greatest Game Every Played qualifies.	By the time the field has dwindled to Ouimet and Vardon, it's a match between good-guy heroes. We'll be happy no matter who wins, and happy that it's finally strolled to a conclusion.	Despite all the underdog sports movie conventions, the likable cast and lush production values make The Greatest Game Ever Played a solid and uplifting tale.
Even though you already know it isn't going to end well, it's suffused with a clammy-handed anxiety that belies its age. The dialogue, too, is classic Wilder -- almost poetic in its snappy, purple lyricism.	Variations and tributes can't blunt the sting of Wilder's acidic noir benchmark	Film noir at its finest, a template of the genre, etc. Billy Wilder in full swing, Barbara Stanwyck's finest hour, and Fred MacMurray makes a great chump.	Classic film noir and classic Billy Wilder. What more can you ask?	Such folks as delight in murder stories for their academic elegance alone should find this one steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length.	A dark, tautly constructed adaptation of James M. Cain's novel -- penned by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler -- Double Indemnity continues to set the standard for the best in Hollywood film noir.
Audiences won't be crazy about what they see in these Mirrors.	Alexandre Aja must have thought that just because he's basing a film around mirrors acting irrationally, he can proceed to remove logic from all aspects of the film.	this is a film that starts out strong, but turns silly once you bring the lights up on the plot.	In SUSPIRIA, Udo Kier says that "Bad luck isn't caused by broken mirrors, but by broken minds"-Well after making this silly movie, director Alexandre Aja might think otherwise	at some point Aja appears to have decided that he cannot be bothered with all this remake malarkey, and instead he just goes completely ape with his plotting...could well go on to become a cult classic.	Inconsistency and listless plot make this K-horror remake a less-than-frightening time at the movies.
"Our mission is to find our necks," Rock tells his ornery platoon. "I left mine in a locker at Gold's Gym in 1985, and I haven't seen it since."	This isn't worth turning off the PlayStation to go see.	Yes, Doom is a bad movie but you already knew that.	Fans of the game would rather play it themselves than watch someone else do it for them.	Another sorry chapter in Hollywood's infatuation with video games, Doom is basically a deadly dull rehash of Resident Evil, which in turn was a third-generation clone of Aliens.	Sure to please fans of the video game, but lacking in plot and originality to please other moviegoers.
Gibson remains -- despise or defend him -- a uniquely fascinating screen presence as our shattered hero.	Scriptwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have sadly sacrificed some of the original's cultural specificity and its slow-burn quality.	Complicated and stupid, a waste of Mel's considerable talents and worse, a waste of your time.	Edge of Darkness is effective as a cathartic revenge yarn, at least until the absurdities begin to pile up during the final half-hour.	Love him or loathe him, the Melster still has screen presence. That's why he's a star.	For better and for worse, Edge of Darkness offers vintage Mel Gibson, working within the familiar framework of a bloody revenge thriller.
It's light on plot and character, but the stunts are well staged.	More than a martial arts whiz, the 41-year-old Chan possesses the comic timing of a born clown, the grace of a Broadway hoofer and the daredevil bravado of an Evel Knievel.	The emphasis here is on impossible stunts and hilarious gags. When one of the bad guys says, 'I can't believe this guy,' the audience will likely agree.	It's not often you find a movie as exciting and awful as Rumble in the Bronx.	All of Chan's movies are dumb fun, and this was no exception.	An entertaining Jackie Chan stunt-fest in which the impressive action sequences overcome the low production value and by-the-numbers plot.
One has to wonder if the studio will make back its investment of some $45 million. But obviously, Depp is as big a box office draw as anyone, so it will be interesting.	We have the feeling that Kemp/Thompson saw much of life through the bottom of a dirty glass and did not experience it with any precision. The film duplicates this sensation, not with much success.	While it's not 100% successful, most of the time it will have you either laughing hysterically or mad as hell.	Of obvious interest to Thompson acolytes and of no obvious interest to anyone else. As a fan of Thompson and Robinson, I enjoyed the film's laid-back shagginess.	Because the pace and trajectory changes so noticeably, "The Rum Diary" almost feels like three different films. Some may like that; I didn't.	It's colorful and amiable enough, and Depp's heart is clearly in the right place, but The Rum Diary fails to add sufficient focus to its rambling source material.
The pace was a guaranteed adrenalin-pumper, Dennis Hopper was suitably psycho, and Keanu and Sandra made their careers.	It's more than a mere knockoff. It's a clever, carefully constructed action machine that generates lots of high-octane thrills and spills. What it lacks in originality, it more than makes up for in full-throttle pacing.	A riotously enjoyable locomotive of action, Speed is driven by a premise of such crystalline purity that its ridiculousness becomes part of the fun.	The story is a starting gun, a reason to roll out the high-tech action movie chase and demolition experts. It's gaudy action shtick, and it's fitting that the last stop is at Hollywood Boulevard.	Filled with plenty of chills and thrills; it speaks to the modern mania for velocity.	A terrific popcorn thriller, Speed is taut, tense, and energetic, with outstanding performances from Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and Sandra Bullock.
Robin Williams proves to topical comedy what Lawrence Welk is to smoking jazz, and a marketing bait-and-switch leads to a ludicrously dumb paranoid thriller. It lazily hopes its conceit and comedian work. Neither does.	Is there any other comedian who recycles material as often and for as long as Robin Williams? He's the last man in America who thinks Monica Lewinsky jokes are still funny.	Barry Levinson's Man of the Year squanders a promising premise; it's ultimately overlong, underwritten and strangely unfunny.	Lacks humor and bite.	There's nothing about Man of the Year that's quite as fantastic as its depiction of moribund Saturday Night Live as culturally and politically relevant.	Weakened by second-half attempts at thriller and romance, this presidential comedy also fails to hit any sharp political notes, resulting in a confused and unsatisfying mess.
Profoundly in context with the world as it is in its acute hour of human need, in response to the urgency of the critical historical moment.	Abderrahmane Sissako makes no pretence at neutrality with this indictment of globalised capitalism.	If Jean-Luc Godard had kept his sense of humor, he might be making engaging movies like Bamako.	Yes, this is strong stuff, but spoken in an articulate, measured, passionate West African voice, it's impossible to ignore.	Very important, very impressive.	A courtroom drama and a portrait of everyday Mali life, Bamako approaches both subjects with equal skill and success.
Stars four Oscar-winning actors. It's not every day that you're able to use 'Helen Mirren' and 'heavy artillery' in the same sentence, but Red gives you the opportunity.	When people this talented get together there's an expectation of entertainment that this inert comic book adaptation just doesn't deliver.	A beautifully executed, slow-motion, guns blazing Bruce Willis' exit from a spinning cop car proves you are going to have the best time you'll have in a theater all year.	It's halfway between comedy and action, and it doesn't quite work as either.	Typical action-blockbuster stuff, entertaining and mindless, that is elevated by the high-wattage cast.	It may not be the killer thrill ride you'd expect from an action movie with a cast of this caliber, but Red still thoroughly outshines most of its big-budget counterparts with its wit and style.
Mr. Lawrence is better when forced to react to his co-stars.	This is a film that appears to have been made without benefit of a script -- it's a seemingly random collection of shots and scenes strung together with no concern for continuity, common sense, or an audience's intelligence.	There's something about a plus-size floral housedress that brings out the best in many male comics, and Lawrence is no exception.	Wade through the slower spots and you'll be rewarded with some hilarious bits.	squarely aimed at the type of audience willing to overlook all sorts of inconsistencies and stereotypes in a movie as long as it includes a few juicy toilet jokes.	Big Momma's House is funny in some parts, but it is essentially a one-joke movie.
Nothing scares Lara, so nothing scares us, the audience.	repeat after me, "it's a video game, it's a video game, it's a video game".	It's frustrating to watch the filmmakers unable to make the pulse-pounding leaps that their title character would complete with ease.	Jolie gives Lara an upper class British accent, but it's so denatured that she sounds like one of those British techno-pop goddesses on a Valium drip.	In the end, Croft loses to the most dangerous villain of them all: mediocrity.	Angelina Jolie is perfect for the role of Lara Croft, but even she can't save the movie from a senseless plot and action sequences with no emotional impact.
[An] alternately maddening and magnificent documentary.	[Camalier's] rambling love letter to a unique American sound is not only full of the beautiful landscapes and small town Americana which inspired it, it has an enveloping, beautiful heart.	A marvelous doc about the creation of the fabled Muscle Shoals Sound -- as powerful today as it was 50 years ago.	Though Muscle Shoals can seem a little conventional, you could never say the same thing of its soundtrack	Exceptional music, unexceptional documentary on the swampy sounds of the famous Tennessee backing band.	Essential for soul fans and entertaining for novices, Muscle Shoals offers a compelling, warts-and-all glimpse at one of the most fascinating stories in modern American music.
Ultimately, the tale is inspiring: Why can't we all be like the Vogels and become great collectors?	You can't hate the film anymore than you can hate Herb and Dorothy. But this is lazy work.	Delightful, involving doc about an unlikely couple who became pioneer contemporary art collectors with working-class salaries.	A solid and engaging documentary that shows the chasm between art and those that are removed, for various reasons, from its creation and most readily accessible exhibition to be a largely artificial construct.	The movie gives us an eyeful, but the unexamined irony is that the nice old couple can't sell the rest of us on why it's good.	While perhaps not as probing as it could have been, Megumi Sasaki's languidly paced documentary is as entertaining as it is inspiring.
Arnold's last barbarian role -- worth it for that if nothing else.	...pure silliness, but not silly enough to qualify as amusing. Face it; it's just dull.	If you are rapt by swollen muscles, heaving bosoms, swordplay and a tirade of hammy, fantasy claptrap, the woefulness of this film won't put you off.	Deathless lines of dialogue like "In life all is not swordplay" make Red Sonja laughable in ways that the screenwriters did not intend.	Mr. Fleischer brings absolutely no playfulness to what might, at least, have been enjoyably light. And he brings out the worst in a cast that was ill-chosen to begin with.	Dull, poorly directed, and badly miscast, Red Sonja is an uninspired conclusion to Schwarzenegger's barbarian trilogy.
This bumpy buddy comedy stays in low gear for almost its entire journey. ... As the leader of a pack of redneck bikers, hammy Ray Liotta is so nasty, even his tattoos have a record.	Truly awful, monumentally inept, wholly unwatchable.	Fluff aimed at conservative Middle America, a cynical go-with-the-demographic-trends movie that's shallow and stupid, but featuring big names guaranteeing box office success.	Eminently forgettable.	Throughout the film, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, et al don't seem to be bonding so much as acting at each other.	Wild Hogs is a dreadful combination of fish-out-of-water jokes, slapstick, and lazy stereotypes.
While most movie-goers will love the film's sheer thrill ride, X-Men fans might leave a little disappointed. The best, I guess, is yet to come. .	Once you get past issues related to trying to figure out who everyone is, how they relate to one another, and what their powers are, the movie turns out to be pretty entertaining.	a hugely enjoyable adventure that does what all sequels should: It fleshes out the themes and ideas of the first part instead of merely staging variations on the stunts and jokes that audiences loved.	Most of the good things about X-Men are once again in evidence in this continuation of the epic.	With X2, our modern day movie superheroes have evolved. They are as human as they have ever been, and the more human they get, the more exciting they are to watch.	Tightly scripted, solidly acted, and impressively ambitious, X2: X-Men United is bigger and better than its predecessor -- and a benchmark for comic sequels in general.
Loaded with dramatic irony in the first half and with tension in the second, the film gives Douglas another chance to do his slick, sinister best; Paltrow a chance to extend her emotional range; and Mortensen a chance to play the chameleon.	...the film is so lacking in anything original that it is hardly worth recommending.	...the story offers so many lapses in logic, so many plot holes and so much dialogue to howl for that there's plenty to talk about afterward.	Somewhere, Alfred Hitchcock is yawning.	His [Davis] direction is swift and very effective, and the movie, shot in shades of ebony (the color of black marble), looks exceptionally handsome.	A slick little thriller that relies a bit too much on surprise events to generate suspense.
...suffers from lethargic pacing, so a lot of good will is required to make it through to the electric climax.	so lacking in punch or drive that you just start waiting for the thing to end	Sonny Blake turns out a literally electric performance on his electric guitar.	John Sayles is a natural storyteller and national treasure, dedicated to spinning narratives of America, state by state, into a vibrant quilt of 20th-century American history.	Honeydripper's story isn't anything you haven't seen a dozen times before, but where Sayles succeeds is in his ability to dramatize the psychological and linguistic details that give identity to a subculture struggling for survival.	Honeydripper's electric musical numbers and sharp performances make for an exciting film, despite its slow pace.
A big, sweaty, pulpy adventure tale that's both exciting AND unintentionally amusing.	Too dull to be unintentionally funny.	No comic book stuff here: the film is dark and gloomy with excessive violence.	OK sandals and loin cloth muscle adventure...which made Arnold a star.	This primitive, mythic epic catapulted Schwarzenegger to movie stardom after being a famous body-builder.	Though Conan may take itself too seriously for some, this adventure film about a former slave seeking vengeance is full of quotable Schwarzenegger lines and gritty action.
Wrenching Holocaust fable with bittersweet humor.	The film's title, which very well could have been a straightforward declaration prior to the war, becomes a source of twisted irony once we witness Guido pull down the grate outside his humble bookshop and the words JEWISH STORE are seen sprayed across th	...silly, to be sure, implausible, sometimes slapstick, often sophomoric; but it is never disrespectful. ...a sweet and moving experience.	A daring, highly original work.	Its sentiment is inescapable, but genuine poignancy and pathos are also present, and an overarching sincerity is visible too.	Benigni's earnest charm, when not overstepping its bounds into the unnecessarily treacly, offers the possibility of hope in the face of unflinching horror.
...intrigues with its small observations of what makes people tick.	What interests the Dardennes ... is not only how Bruno became the kind of man who would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption.	Viewers in Europe have swooned, it is said, at this movie's painful inching toward redemption. Against that, I have to report a slow drip of disappointment.	The Dardennes' documentary style -- real locations, hand-held camerawork and no music -- help increase not only the realism, but the claustrophobia.	Every act in the film has a mythic resonance.	The Dardennes continue to excel at presenting works of rigorous naturalism, with detached observations of authentic characters that nevertheless resonate with complex moral issues.
for those unlucky souls who may be forced to take children to the sequel, there is a bit of semihappy news: Although 'Dozen' was obnoxious, 'Dozen 2' is merely innocuous.	There's a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved, and Duff, who's gone from wholesome to haggard in two short years, is flat-out scary.	Jimmy's kids' resentment is noticed only by the keenly attentive Carmen Electra.	A textbook example of how not to mess with success, Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is every bit as forced, synthetic, banal and mawkish as the first edition.	As I watched this sequel, a certain good feeling began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake Yours, Mine and Ours.	A sequel to a remake, Cheaper 2 wastes its solid cast in scenes of over-the-top, predictable humor.
A quiet, graceful drama that sneaks up on you.	The only big question you may be asking yourself after watching this will probably be "What could [fill in the name of any of the talented people inexplicably involved here] have possibly been thinking when they signed on?"	An easy film to surrender to.	The further the characters venture into the mystic, the more the movie itself seems to dissipate.	A snarky film filled with messages about faith? You better believe it.	Full of Hallmark-truisms and pop songs presented with strained significance, this comic foible intends less to convert than to preach to the choir.
You could make the same movie using the music of Huey Lewis. And most likely a less embarrassing one.	Its crazed ambition. When it falls, it falls far, but at least that means it's reaching high.	I'll go ahead and say it: I'm embarrassed by how much I liked this movie.	There's brilliance in there, that's undeniable -- and if you're in the right mood, that will be all you need.	Every little thing Julie Taymor does is magic.	Psychedelic musical numbers can't mask Across the Universe's clichéd love story and uninteresting characters.
Excellent but too mature for the littlest kids.	The Maltese Falcon is among the most important and influential movies to emerge from the Hollywood system -- as significant in some ways as its contemporary, Citizen Kane.	Huston's curdled view of humanity (especially women) is already evident in his debut film, a punchy and redoubtable exercise in mystery.	Like two other amateur directors who appeared the same year (Orson Welles and Preston Sturges), Huston knew what he was doing.	"The stuff that dreams are made of," comments Spade about the elusive black bird of the title, a sentiment easily applied to this indisputable masterpiece.	Suspenseful, labyrinthine, and brilliantly cast, The Maltese Falcon is one of the most influential noirs -- as well as a showcase for Humphrey Bogart at his finest.
Not flashy, but backed by two of the year's finest performances, this intimate drama is a revealing look at one of the more fascinating individuals of our generation.	As the mathematical wunderkind who advanced a scientific theory beyond anyone's imagination, the great young actor Eddie Redmayne (My Week With Marilyn, Les Miserables), gives the most electrifying performance of the year.	James Marsh's biopic salutes the famous physicist's commitment, but falls short of exploring his brilliant ideas.	There are no significant revelations, but maybe that's the beauty of James Marsh's biopic about Stephen Hawking: The Theory of Everything isn't looking for answers to the universe.	A well-written, well-directed movie an average person like myself can grasp. If I want a more complicated explanation of the universe, then I can refer to Hawking's book, "A Brief History of Time."	Part biopic, part love story, The Theory of Everything rises on James Marsh's polished direction and the strength of its two leads.
This is a movie that makes you pay attention to action and consequences in a way that has more or less completely disappeared from mainstream cinema.	It resonates deeply thanks to its universality, which it miraculously achieves without ever once selling out the social mores of its location. Profoundly affecting, wonderfully performed and endlessly surprising.	[The film] puts us in the uncomfortable role of the adjudicator.	A stunning piece of work, beautifully telling a raw human story with expert writing, direction, photography, editing and acting	Farhadi's true focus is the flawed capacity for any law -- any form of cold rationality, period -- to address the slippery nature of human affairs. It's a frantic microcosm of life itself.	Morally complex, suspenseful, and consistently involving, A Separation captures the messiness of a dissolving relationship with keen insight and searing intensity.
Worth mentioning in the same breath as Rushmore or The Royal Tenenbaums? Absolutely not.	Intermittently brilliant, intermittently hilarious -- and occasionally tedious.	There is a charming 90-minute comedy somewhere in Life Aquatic, but the extra 30 or so minutes in this version point out just how self-indulgent Anderson is becoming.	I can't recommend it, but I would not for one second discourage you from seeing it.	The story (written by Anderson and Noah Baumbach) meanders in such a meaningless way that the visual details, as carefully wrought as they are, come off as mere props.	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is getting soaked by many critics, who call it smug, ironic and artificial. Still, others have praised the movie's sheer uniqueness, eccentricity and whimsy.
Uniformly well-performed and blessed with a spotless screenplay that could easily pass a naval inspection.	An absorbing, well-acted film with a low-key sense of humor.	Denzel Washington's directorial debut reveals a capable -- if often alarmingly low-key -- presence behind the lens.	Admittedly moving and even occasionally uplifting, "Fisher" just seems like a film road well-traveled so many other times.	While the film is rated PG-13 for language and the brawling, this is one film that high school teachers can use as a teaching tool without any rationalization.	Washington's directing debut is a solidly crafted, emotionally touching work.
You cannot fail to be moved by this story of young Sudanese refugees - and not just to tears either.	May not be anything like Witherspoon's answer to 'The Blind Side,' but definitely worth seeing.	If a measure of tasteful restraint is detectable, it serves at least to allow for the depiction of human emotion instead of the market-driven blandification of history.	The Good Lie honestly earns its laughter and tears, even if it has to do so by way of some Hollywood window dressing.	The rougher edges of the likes of In This World or The Golden Dream were perhaps beyond its multiplex-oriented remit, but Falardeau works in surprising levels of funny, winning, stirring detail.	The Good Lie sacrifices real-life nuance in order to turn its true story into a Hollywood production, but the results still add up to a compelling, well-acted, and deeply moving drama.
it would be difficult to come away from Tupac: Resurrection without some level of admiration for this complex artist.	A balanced, insightful portrait of the provocative hip-hop icon.	Even if the warts in the portrait are reduced to mere blemishes, it provides as full a picture of a gifted artist as can be expected of an authorized biography.	Tupac's fierce charisma keeps this documentary watchable until the bitter end.	An open-ended, honest portrait of a hugely talented young man.	There's no question where the director's loyalty lies in this one-sided tribute; however, Tupac's charisma makes this doc an engaging sit.
The movie is a way to kill 90 minutes if you have small children to amuse, but those 90 minutes could also be spent with them at the library, maybe, or at a swimming pool.	By the time the gang performs a rendition of 'Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now,' I wanted to reply, 'Well, you don't have to rub it in.'	Eighty-seven minutes, the duration of this auditory assault, would be sufficient to slaughter every brain cell and induce blithering idiocy.	Well, at least it isn't in 3D.	You usually have to go to an Adam Sandler movie, or the Quad Cinema, to see something as incompetently made as "Alvin and the Chipmunks.''	Lazy, rote, and grating, Chipwrecked is lowest-common-denominator family entertainment that's strictly for the very, very, very young at heart.
If "Mad Max" embraced a geneticist's acumen and "The Road Warrior" a philosopher's spirit, "Thunderdome" is about cold, hard economics - not just in Bartertown's transactions but the market expectations that come with the receipt of studio funding.	Definitely the worst movie in the Mad Max series. Weakly plotted, largely a re-hash of the previous movie without even the vaguest hint of tension.	It's hard not to wonder why Beyond Thunderdome isn't better.	There is something to get excited about in this third chapter of the Mad Max series: the powerhouse presence of Tina Turner.	Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't a bad movie. It has entertaining sections, decent performances and more than a few provocative images. But it also has a major shortcoming: It's too darned sane.	Beyond Thunderdome deepens the Mad Max character without sacrificing the amazing vehicle choreography and stunts that made the originals memorable.
Mendes loves his performers, framing their big moments with suburban metaphors and dizzily poetic fantasies.	Startling, brilliantly assembled.	Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall uses shadows and the color red to startling effect, and director Sam Mendes moves around his characters so assuredly, I realized you don't even need dialogue to follow the plot.	There's so much to see in this movie that, with every blink, you'll miss something amazing. Something poignant. Something timeless.	It's like Norman Bates getting good advice from Mother.	Flawlessly cast and brimming with dark, acid wit, American Beauty is a smart, provocative high point of late '90s mainstream Hollywood film.
the film's overall effect is undeniable, not only on the history of cinema as a whole, but in each new viewing that reveals another dimension or additional detail, the sum total of which is one of the true cinematic masterpieces	This story has it all: brilliant characters and a wonderful, satisfying story.	It's a delightful family fantasy film that is timeless, one that both children and adults can enjoy.	The film is as charming as it is novel in conception and execution and it is so bound to appeal as strongly to grown-ups as to youngsters.	It is a classic, as important cinematically as The Birth of a Nation or the birth of Mickey Mouse.	With its involving story and characters, vibrant art, and memorable songs, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs set the animation standard for decades to come.
It doesn't disappoint. The line-up reads like a Who's Who of 70s soul and R&B. And the sound quality's shockingly good.	While there's an awful lot to like about this infectious celebration of a remarkable event featuring some superb, larger-than-life performers at the top of their game, the enterprise comes across as a bit of a missed opportunity.	Though conventionally filmed in a chronological fashion, this could be the most energetic movie this year.	Documentary about the three-day music festival preceding the famous Ali-Foreman fight has its moments, but plays too much like what it is: outtakes from the Oscar-winning When We Were Kings.	For a documentary about a music festival, Soul Power doesn't include nearly enough music.	Featuring some incredible performances from many 70s soul legends, Soul Power is an exhilarating snap-shot of a bygone era.
Made when Oliver Stone still had cred and Cruise wasn't a laughing stock. A fine movie.	Tom Cruise proves he's more than a chiseled face in Stone's anti-war epic.	If this is a four star film, you can rest assured that three of those stars come from the balls-out bravura of Tom Cruise in the lead role.	Hey...Cruise can act!	An exceptional feature on every level of execution, also displaying a rare sensitivity to Stone that he would spend the rest of his career trying to bury in violence and experimentation.	Led by an unforgettable performance from Tom Cruise, Born on the Fourth of July finds director Oliver Stone tackling thought-provoking subject matter with ambitious élan.
A film that may be instantly forgettable but should keep you grinning for a couple of hours.	Enormously entertaining!	The comedy here is sometimes so sharp that you could roll in the aisle with laughter and not seem any odder than the characters you see onscreen.	[VIDEO] You'd never guess that the movie is loosely based on Raymond Chandler's detective novel "The Big Sleep."	In many ways, The Big Lebowski has surpassed Fargo as the Coens' high-water mark.	Typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the Coen Brothers, brought to life with strong performances from Goodman and Bridges.
This is more of the same.	The awful writing and weak acting keeps the movie from delivering an experience as strong as the original.	You don't need a road map to conclude this franchise has run out of gas and is going nowhere.	Fast and Furious gets off to a terrific start but quickly runs out of gas, thanks to a lazy script and some unimaginative action sequences.	A film that ultimately feels more like a cobbled together rent-a-car than a sleek Euro-styled crotch magnet	While Fast and Furious features the requisite action and stunts, the filmmakers have failed to provide a competent story or compelling characters.
A succulent and devious drawing-room mystery that, in its panoramic way, takes a puckish pleasure in scrambling and reshuffling the worlds of upstairs and downstairs.	Pret-a-Porter and Dr. T. & and the Women, tarnished his '90s comeback, but the ornery Altman is back in top form here.	It's lovely to see that Altman, now in his 70s, still has an acid bite that would sting filmmakers half his age.	obviously choreographed by a director of great skill, yet the sheer number of the players allow few to really register in a mystery which offers few surprises	An Anglophile's delight.	A mixture of Upstairs, Downstairs, Clue, and perceptive social commentary, Gosford Park ranks among director Altman's best.
... All about taking things that could be salacious and sensational, and paring them down to a realistic, deeply affecting, human level.	You think you know exactly how this work-distracted father is going to reconnect with his daughters, and what obligatory moments the movie will provide, but both the script and the stars are too smart for that.	The Descendants is a wonderful film, full of nuance and beleaguered humanity.	"The Descendants" is one of the stranger and yet one of the more effective weepers in recent years.	...a solid, grown-up film that reminds us that there's real heroism in simply living day to day.	Funny, moving, and beautifully acted, The Descendants captures the unpredictable messiness of life with eloquence and uncommon grace.
It's dogged by awkward dialogue, a ridiculous plot and lackluster performances, especially by the leads, Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens.	Definitely appealing to teen girls, anyone else will only accompany them if they have true inner beauty.	For a fable about a magical curse, "Beastly" is strangely earthbound. And once it starts, it just seems to go on sappily ever after.	Disney did it better but this is an acceptable re-telling of the old Beauty and the Beast legend.	Roses and love bloom, and you might giggle yourself sick, but this is the kind of cornball entertainment that rainy afternoons were made for. Throw in a cozy sofa too. Beastly will size down well on your television.	Fundamentally misguided, poorly written, and badly acted, Beastly adds little to the legacy of its timeless source material.
Every time an adult ended up in traction or broke wind, the three-year-olds in the audience were freshly ecstatic.	Being aimed at children isn't a valid excuse for a movie to be simple-minded and illogical. You know that, right?	In a crowded cinema, this is every post-pubescent's nightmare.	Yes, it's probably a good film for children. But when films far more sophisticated and enjoyable like "Up" or "Where the Wild Things Are" come out, a film like this merely seems trivial.	Ross Bagdasarian's enduring characters are a bit tougher to endure in this charmless sequel.	This Squeakquel may entertain the kiddies, but it's low on energy and heavily reliant on slapstick humor.
The voice-in-the-dark hysteria comes no less out of Stone, seizing the success d'estime transplant for the personal, even confessional, quandary of the anguished truth-teller in the end engulfed by the system.	If you think you're unshockable, see this film and then see what you think.	An underrated movie, Talk Radio has matured into a strong reflection on the nature of celebrity. Oliver Stone hasn't made many better films.	Far more Eric Bogosian than Oliver Stone, and still timely, even after fifteen years.	Stone's hyperkinetic direction keeps you riveted. He stalks every move Champlain makes around the studio as he revs up bigots, druggies, sex fiends and religious fanatics whom he then viciously puts down.	The gripping union of a director and star at the peak of their respective powers, Talk Radio offers the viewer a singularly unlikable character and dares you to look away.
It looks as if the film has an ambition to do for horror cinema what the Book of Revelations did for Christianity.	Like most of the Scream movies, The Cabin in the Woods provokes chills of dread even as it hilariously deconstructs the horror movie sub-genre by sub-genre.	I personally wouldn't consider it a game-changer but The Cabin In The Woods kept me on my toes and has many interesting elements.	The less you know about this movie going in, the more fun you're going to have.	More than anything else, Cabin feels like the endgame of so-called fanboy culture in the way in which it is first and foremost about itself, interested only in a fundamental adherence to rules of its own devising and fenced off from the world at large.	The Cabin in the Woods is an astonishing meta-feat, capable of being funny, strange, and scary -- frequently all at the same time.
Miranda July takes the twee and cute thing WAY too far this time	July's film-making is a taste I have yet fully to acquire, but she has a distinctive vision, a style, placed before you on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. I took it.	Many viewers, especially her detractors, can't see the forest for the twee in July's films. That's certainly true of "The Future" - but burrow down past the creepy-cutesy touches, and you find a film that's painfully real.	July, who gave us the lovably odd Me and You and Everyone We Know, has layered on so much self-conscious whimsy - monologues from the cat, dialogues with the moon and other dashes of magical realism - that the central drama struggles to be heard.	It's parodic Sundance independent cinema - pure, aimless, triple-brewed whimsy.	A dark and whimsical exploration of human existence that challenges viewers as much as it rewards them.
Rarely has the American male been portrayed more accurately... or with funnier results.	Ninety minutes spent learning how not to pick up girls. This is what the movies were made for, isn't it?	Jon Favreau has created what amounts to a comedy with a National Geographic twist, a charming, almost documentary account of the habits of the North American human male in the wild.	The arc is nothing new, but the writing and pacing make it fresh and energetic, at least enough for it to have became a cult classic.	Favreau's script and Doug Liman's direction are what makes this little tale come alive.	Funny, heartfelt, and effortlessly cool, Swingers made stars out of Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, established Doug Liman as a director to watch.
This is a good but not great Star Trek movie, a sort of compromise between the first two.	Offers a thiought-provoking treatment of the mind-body problem.	Familiarity breeds contempt since this is not really a notable entry in the Star Trek series.	Contrived but involving.	Stirring but sad science-fiction enterprise.	Though it may be short on dazzling special effects, The Search for Spock is still a strong Star Trek installment, thanks to affecting performances by its iconic cast.
Modest at best.	Screenwriter Gina Wendkos, working from Meg Cabot's novel, resorts to monotonous movie clichés: almost uniformly cruel classmates and a callous, cacophonous mob of media jackals.	The classy Julie Andrews almost saves this picture from mediocrity.	As far out of the intended demographic as I am, I have to admit there were certain pleasures to the movie.	A non-animated G-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts, all the good stuff, has been exorcised from the finished product.	A charming, if familiar, makeover movie for young teenage girls.
Costner hasn't been this charming and spontaneous for years.	Lose about 30 minutes and there may be a stronger film in there.	What makes Tin Cup such an unabashed pleasure is Shelton's care in writing and developing interesting characters.	[A] quirkily easygoing comedy.	Tin Cup, starring Kevin Costner as a likable loser, accomplishes the impossible, maybe the unimaginable -- it makes golf entertaining.	Breezy and predictable, Tin Cup is a likeable sports comedy that benefits greatly from Kevin Costner's amiable lead performance.
reinvented the American horror film	The dialogue and background music sound hollow, as if they had been recorded in an empty swimming pool, and the wobbly camera seems to have a fetishist's interest in hands.	Romero saw the enemy, and they are the zombie masses among us. There is nowhere safe to hide.	One of the best films ever made, and possibly the most influential horror movie of all time.	Ainda hoje permanece como um dos melhores do gęnero.	George A. Romero's debut set the template for the zombie film, and features tight editing, realistic gore, and a sly political undercurrent.
It's a wonderful documentary look at an astonishingly successful public-school chess program that manages to be more moving and heartening than you expect. Which is saying a lot.	There's a general spirit of triumph and perseverance to "Brooklyn Castle" that's inevitably uplifting.	We ... gain a keen sense of how chess in particular helps otherwise academically challenged kids find a way into their own brains.	There's an irresistible cinematic appeal to watching kids dedicate themselves to fundamentally non-kid-like practices like competitive ballroom dancing or studying etymology to ease their way in spelling bees.	The film's structure is routine, but the film doesn't sidestep its more serious issues, while its charming subjects make it a winner both on and off the chessboard.	Brooklyn Castle is a warm, engaging, and even uplifting documentary about chess-playing whiz kids.
[Director McDonagh's] seesawing between slapstick and horror comes across as opportunistic because ultimately he cannot place the lives of these men in a credible moral context.	After playing one too many sullen poseurs it's clear Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes had a ball making an inky black comedy seething with grandiose invective.	a fantastic start to a new career.	Those who know McDonagh's work know a vein of darkness will run deeply through the comedy. It has seldom been darker. Or funnier.	There are good moments laced through the severely uneven In Bruges, but the best reason for seeing it is Bruges itself.	Featuring witty dialogue and deft performances, In Bruges is an effective mix of dark comedy and crime thriller elements.
Filmmakers showed great affection for the material they parodied and this is always an important ingredient for any successful parody.	We can proudly agree that it is indeed the most Obvious and Hypocritical comedy of 2001.	Too much of Not Another Teen Movie simply duplicates previous films, without adding anything.	For every one and a half good jokes, there's a bad one, yet when its funny, its more often than not, very funny.	If you haven't brushed up on the latest Freddie Prinze Jr. bomb, you'll simply feel stuck in detention.	NATM has some funny moments, but the movie requires the audience to have familiarity with the movies being spoofed and a tolerance for toilet and sexual humor to be truly effective.
just about the same exact movie as all those other trifles aimed at the tween girl demographic that have been unleashed upon the unsuspecting moviegoing masses this year	Leigh Dunlap's script abounds in one-liners of mild pedigree at best, and under the direction of Mark Rosman a timeless tale has been transformed into an enervated sitcom.	It's all way too bland.	In typical Lizzie spirit, it's harmless, it's sweet, it's corny, it's fun and it all comes out impossibly right.	Duff has yet another brainless movie to add to her repertoire.	An uninspired, generic updating of the classic fairy tale.
Tangerines ends up being serviceably bleak, but rarely compelling.	By the end, Georgian director-writer Zaza Urushadze has performed a small miracle by presenting the insanity of war in such a compact form.	Although the subject of civil war within the former Soviet countries has been tackled in other movies, this retelling is one of the most concise and affecting.	Uses its small scale to say something big.	If the lesson about our similarities outweighing our differences is obvious, the conclusion is unexpected and unforgettable.	Tangerines' impassioned message and the strong work of a solid cast more than make up for the movie's flawed narrative and uneven structure.
The latest computer-animated adventure from Pixar Studios has a simple premise that should enchant viewers of all ages, fusing childhood fantasies of escape with adult feelings of melancholy and regret.	Another near-perfect Pixarian blend of escapist fun and heart-warming sentiment.	A hugely enjoyable work, whose care, craftsmanship and creative courage are rarely found in mainstream films - animated or otherwise.	Rarely has any film, let alone an animated one powered by the logic of dream and fantasy, been able to move so successfully -- and so effortlessly -- through so many different kinds of cinematic territory.	A highpoint of ingenuity and storytelling in the Pixar canon and indeed the animated form.	An exciting, funny, and poignant adventure, Up offers an impeccably crafted story told with wit and arranged with depth, as well as yet another visual Pixar treat.
It's generally friendly and enjoyable, but it sags a bit.	What's really lost in Rio is the participants' sense of humor.	With its shaky camera zooms and ridiculous abundance of split-screens shots, it also nails once again the stylistic quirks of the pop films of the 1960s in a way that's more astute than Austin Powers and funnier than recent Hollywood efforts.	All this is mighty silly, but there's something to be said for watching a French movie that, for a change, isn't about l'amour, existential angst, or madness.	Can't overcome the fact that it's sending up a 007 series that -- with the exception of 2006's superb Casino Royale -- already plays like a parody of itself.	Led by another appealing performance from Jean Dujardin, this sequel offers more absurdly fun action -- and more politically incorrect humor -- for fans of '60s spy films.
This annoyingly disjointed shocker stumbles badly after promising early scenes, and quickly devolves into a chaotic blur of underdeveloped characters, illogical transitions and standard-issue scary-movie tropes.	Impressive on a number of levels and awful on precious few.	Simultaneously boring and overwrought (especially in the laugh-inducing climax)...fails as a sequel, as a metaphysical exercise and even as a cheesy exploitation item.	...I had goose-bumps on my goose-bumps clear to the top of my head...	Jesus, Mary and Joseph -- could they have made a worse movie out of Exorcist: The Beginning?	A mediocre, gory horror film, nowhere near the quality of the 1973 original.
3-D is the ideal toy for an old enfant terrible like Godard to play with. Packed with dazzling images, the film makes 3-D feel like something brand-new to the medium.	The reason to buy a ticket is to take the ride, though, and seeing what 84-year-old Godard does when given an extra dimension is intensely fascinating.	The elder filmmaker's take on our world of separations and alienation.	Anyone interested in the possibilities of the moviegoing experience - what can happen in a dark theater - owes it to themselves to say hello to "Goodbye to Language."	Shooting on various low- and medium-grade digital cameras, Godard turns "Goodbye to Language" into a rumination on memory, communication, everyday life and sexual tension.	As visually thrilling as it is inscrutable, Goodbye to Language 3D offers a late-period masterpiece from a legendary director still very much in control of his craft.
After eleven artistically and financially successful features, Pixar has delivered their first dud with Cars 2.	Between the smart visuals and the dumbed-down script, Cars 2 manages to be good enough - which, considering Pixar's past levels of brilliance, is a considerable disappointment.	With Cars 2 it seems Pixar may have fallen on the self-made sword of success. But even for adult audiences, it is no more than middling - it is neither terribly good nor terrible, but it still out-performs the majority of rival animation studios' output.	A light summer feast for the senses that will have the whole family vrooming, for sure.	It looks like a Pixar film, but it sure doesn't feel like one.	Cars 2 is as visually appealing as any other Pixar production, but all that dazzle can't disguise the rusty storytelling under the hood.
Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."	Monkey Kingdom's breathtaking footage of primates in the wild is likely to please animal lovers of all ages.
A blend of documentary and drama which is by turns movingly authentic and deliberately artificial.	The actors in 24 City, an experimental fiction-nonfiction hybrid, bring their own existential realities to their short, touching performances.	This blending of the truth and invention is a key plank of Chinese director Jia Zhang-Ke's work, which skates so close to documentary it is hard to spot the join.	Simultaneously more and less than meets the eye.	Mr. Jia is an artist, one of the most interesting filmmakers working anywhere in the world, and he made his film to bear witness to a way of life while witnesses could still be found.	One of China's most talented directors blurs the lines between non-fiction, drama, and musical theater in this vivid portrait of a country in cultural flux.
Those in sore need of busting a gut had better look elsewhere for comic relief.	Has obviously been made for an audience that has never seen a movie before.	a genuine, heartwarming crowd pleaser, although director Tom Shadyac can be seen disgorging heapings of sentimental claptrap over this biographical landscape.	If Shadyac's aim was to fashion a film kindred in essence to Adams' own outlook and work, then this feelgood extravaganza must come pretty close to hitting that mark.	Almost every scene triggers a sense of deja vu!	Syrupy performances and directing make this dramedy all too obvious.
...it's as if debuting screenwriter Fernley Phillips was too lazy to even rip off second rate King.	There are 23 things wrong with this movie. Or maybe there are 24. Or 165. To be honest, I lost count.	Schumacher's style is too slick, his sense of the macabre too watered-down, and his concentration on the thematic implications of the story too distracted by more generalized ideas to really get at the dark heart of the material.	Do yourself a favor and avoid spending the $23 it will cost to buy two tickets and some popcorn to see The Number 23	There's a mess of things wrong with this suspense thriller. Start with the fact that it's neither suspenseful nor thrilling.	Jim Carrey has been sharp in a number of non-comedic roles, but this lurid, overheated, and self-serious potboiler is not one of them. The Number 23 is clumsy, unengaging, and mostly confusing.
There's echoes of Remains of the Day in a heartfelt drama that seems blown in from another world.	This emotionally tender story of hope leaves an indelible impression. It is not only a biography, but also a loving celluloid tribute to the art of photography.	This is artful filmmaking of the old school.	Slowly paced but beautifully shot and exquisitely detailed, the film drops in sweet, resonating moments to keep bleakness at bay.	Feels a little repetitive and predictable in its depiction of the ordinary and the domestic. But there's something stubborn and gritty about Heiskanen's performance.	Elegant and intimate, Everlasting Moments moves at the deliberate and gentle pace of a classical European period drama.
Will undoubtably please its target audience of teens and early twenty-somethings, but may prove to be a bit too much for older audiences.	Funny as hell!	Pretty darn funny at times.	Could use a lot less of the outrageous Porkies humor and a lot more of the subtle humor of The Graduate.	American Pie is a guilty pleasure at its best!	So embarrassing it's believable, American Pie succeeds in bringing back the teen movie genre.
With Miracle and now Warrior, Gavin O'Conner can lay claim to being the finest sports-drama director working today.	Warrior might be a fairly conventional fight movie in many respects, but it's a damned fine one that more than holds its own against the challengers in its weight class.	Warrior's three principle characterizations are compelling - Nolte in particular gives a tempered performance as the shambling, sad-eyed wreck of a dad - but not enough to mask the film's lesser elements.	Yes, the coincidences are fast and furious, but both Edgerton and Hardy give powerful performances as damaged men.	'Warrior' makes you cheer, sweat, laugh and in a completely shocking twist, cry just a little bit.	Warrior relies on many of the clichés that critics of the genre love to mock -- and it transcends them with gripping action, powerful acting, and heart.
An engrossing and rounded look at the religious, political, and cultural factors behind Arab-Israeli enmity in the Middle East.	The Attack is an ineluctably involving study of a civilized man caught in the middle of a ruthless, bloody conflict.	[An] intelligent, involving movie that's by turns a murder mystery and a politically charged argument about contemporary Palestinian identity.	Telling this story from the point of view of the perpetrator's anguished, bewildered spouse is an inspired idea, and it may work very well in Khadra's book. Suliman, however, is the wrong actor for the job.	...Ziad Doueiri has made the most extraordinary film on Middle Eastern suicide bombings yet by turning it into an investigative love story.	Tense and suspenseful while remaining smart and understated, The Attack honors its complex subject with an intelligent script and captivating performances.
There are no impeccably tailored dinner jackets to wear while sipping stirred martinis, no brainy bombshells to seduce, no cool gadgets, no sportscars. This is dirty -- in all senses of the word -- tradecraft.	The movie remains only academically involving.	De Niro's second film features terrific performances and several impressive scenes, but he appears to have forgotten to hire an editor.	The Good Shepherd feels authentic because it keeps everything on a human scale. There's no mythologizing the agency; there's just a solid depiction of how it was shaped by human beings.	Robert De Niro's icy drama, from Eric Roth's densely researched original screenplay, unfolds over the course of two decades and traces the history of modern-day spycraft.	Though ambitious and confidently directed by Robert De Niro, The Good Shepherd is ultimately a tedious drama that holds few surprises and succumbs to self-seriousness.
There's a bleak beauty to all of this, but also there's a reliance on stereotypes, male and female, that, while they come directly from the source material, are starting to become irritating.	If only the characters didn't have to talk.	I'm not sure what mood I'd have to be in to truly enjoy "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For." But I'm not in it.	There are a handful of ways in which A Dame to Kill For actually improves on the first movie. Alas, none are enough to prevent it from being a substantial disappointment.	Eva Green powers the main story and provides a solid counter-balance to the original film in which most of the women were victims.	A Dame to Kill For boasts the same stylish violence and striking visual palette as the original Sin City, but lacks its predecessor's brutal impact.
A shapeless comedy of little merit.	Judge may not be fully aware of how wildly talented he is, which, in a Hollywood culture swarming with talentless blowhards, makes him something of an anomaly.	Runs out of steam while meandering through what becomes a less than inspired comedy caper.	I got into so many laughing convulsions that I found myself choking!	A pretty listless satire of workplace culture.	Mike Judge lampoons the office grind with its inspired mix of sharp dialogue and witty one-liners.
What happens in Bangkok isn't as much fun as when it happened in Vegas, but it's still worth the trip.	It's fun to hang out with these guys again ... until it isn't. The problems with the first film seem amplified in the second.	Now that we know them, the core characters are all the funnier; they've become an American suburban version of the Three Stooges.	Despite a few slow patches, it is loaded with gut-busting laughs. After its much brainier predecessor, though, it feels like a well-meaning kid forced to follow in the footsteps of his genius older sibling.	Adheres to the old maxim "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," yet somehow manages to break it while not fixing it.	A crueler, darker, raunchier carbon copy of the first installment, The Hangover Part II lacks the element of surprise -- and most of the joy -- that helped make the original a hit.
The movie seems likely to be about anti-Semitism, but that's more the occasion than the subject.	It is Dequenne who holds the film together -- she and Téchiné's youthful touch, which belies his 66 years.	Unlike a lot of ripped from the headlines films, André Téchiné's 'The Girl on the Train' makes no effort to surprise viewers with unflattering or tragic revelations about its protagonists.	André Téchiné's spellbinding storytelling glosses over the issue somewhat, but never deplorably so.	Feels like two different films cobbled together, without much to connect one to the other...the disconnect between the two is huge.	It's a bit of a comedown for director André Téchiné, but this fact-based drama raises some thorny questions -- and benefits from strong performances by Catherine Deneuve and Emilie Dequenne.
Ten years in the making, and this is all we get?	Despite a good cast, this is a badly made film that only barely works as brainless filler.	After this lackluster outing, the thought of a sequel is a stretch even Mr. Fantastic might not be able to make.	Their trip into space may be another small step for man, but it's a giant leap backward for the comic-book-turned-action-movie genre.	Not the best movie of the summer, but it may the best accompaniment to popcorn.	Marred by goofy attempts at wit, subpar acting, and bland storytelling, Fantastic Four is a mediocre attempt to bring Marvel's oldest hero team to the big screen.
Now if only Zaillian and Sorkin could work their magic and make the actual game of baseball that exciting.	Regrets, second chances and the intense pressures of professional sports collide in this terrific drama, capped by an excellent performance from Brad Pitt.	It's an engaging, almost exotic film.	Baseball, for better or worse, has always held itself to greater importance, suffused with the history of the nation itself.	...a smart sports film that's as unique in its approach to the genre as Beane's was to the sport.	Director Bennett Miller, along with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, take a niche subject and turn it into a sharp, funny, and touching portrait worthy of baseball lore.
Paolo Virzě captures the breathless excitement and sharp disappointments of adolescence.	This is not another teen movie. It's a sly political satire disguised as a deceptively light Italian coming-of-age flick.	It's not a satire, it's a family drama whose social and political thoughts flicker like a neon sign on the fritz. Alas, sentimentality is the movie's pilot light.	13-year-old Alice Teghil is brilliant in her acting debut, as is Sergio Castellitto as a psychologically deviant father and husband in this metaphor of modern Italy.	It's an adolescent-to-adult drama that never veers into maudlin or sugary territory. There's a realness on screen that translates to any culture.	This witty movie succeeds as both a modest teen coming-of-age story and a satirical microcosm of Italy's political climate.
A pure joy from start to finish.	This movie really is for the whole family. It's funny, it has some really cool creatures and special effects, a heart-warming story and even a very slick ending, tied directly into one of those super-fan convention halls.	This movie is more than one joke or one idea. It's a thoroughly satisfying comedy -- and a respectable space adventure, as well.	The film's warm-fuzzies are formulaic and not at all genuine. The humor, though, is clever and keenly satiric without being mean-spirited.	It may be a bit too violent for the very young moviegoers, but older children and parents may have a good time together watching some make-believe heroes transform themselves into the real McCoys.	Intelligent and humorous satire with an excellent cast -- no previous Trekkie knowledge needed to enjoy this one.
My Winnipeg is a mobile collage, and its assemblage is fascinating.	an awfully funny rendering of his home life as the runt of the litter	The latter part of 'My Winnipeg' turns too easily to rant against the selling of the cherished past to a rush to modernity.	My Winnipeg is like no documentary you've ever seen.	An incredibly creative docu-fantasia that explores the memory, history, dreams, and myths of his Canadian hometown.	My Winnipeg is a charmingly irreverent 'docu-fantasy' from the unpredictable mind of Guy Maddin.
It's a shame that Robin Williams continues to take roles that exploit and water down his talent.	You'd never know from License to Wed that Krasinski is a big asset to The Office. Here, playing an unappealing male lead, he merely smugs his way through the assignment.	Williams doing his bad boy standup comic cleric routine with relish, can be counted as performing an act of salvation on a movie desperately in need of such not quite divine intervention.	Predictable wedding comedy is all about Williams.	License to Wed is set on a plane of existence not inhabited by intelligent life, but by widespread nincompoops.	Featuring one of Robin Williams' most shtick-heavy performances, the broad and formulaic License to Wed wrings little out of its slightly creepy, unappealing premise.
A real gem.	There is almost nothing slipshod about the film and I suspect that it will only seem more impressive the further we get from the flurry of hype ...	By its midpoint, however, Thornton has begun forcing both the film's poetry and the preternatural goodness of its simple-minded protagonist, and Sling Blade's sweet charms begin to curdle.	[Thornton] does wonders with Yoakam, who could have played a standard villain but always manages to suggest a man trapped within his prejudices.	All the actors in Sling Blade do magnificent work, but it's Thornton who stays with you for days.	You will see what's coming, but the masterful performances, especially Thornton's, will leave you riveted.
delightfully rendered	It sings, it dances, it parties with pride.	An unabashedly affectionate film that becomes a benediction of blessing to its participants.	Fills the eyes brimmingly and, at moments, hits the heart.	In its organic way, it brings up issues that thoughtful American viewers are more interested in dealing with than they might have been had the cataclysmic events of last September not happened.	An insightful, energetic blend of Hollywood and Bollywood styles, Monsoon Wedding is a colorful, exuberant celebration of modern-day India, family, love, and life.
Because the movie believes in its mission, the climax is likely to resonate in your head for hours, perhaps days after viewing.	Seven, the eerie new homicide thriller, has a tantalizingly morbid atmosphere of unease.	As with all the best chillers, the real horror is left unseen and to the viewers' imagination.	The trouble with Seven is that while the premise is intriguing, the movie is gluey, bumbling and singularly un-thrilling.	The opening credit sequence is a mini masterpiece of filmmaking.	A brutal, relentlessly grimy shocker with taut performances, slick gore effects, and a haunting finale.
A high-concept movie that director Michael Bay turns into Bad Boys III: Send in the Clones.	If The Island qualifies as cheese deluxe even by Michael Bay standards, it's because it's the only one in his lavishly decadent oeuvre that actually pretends to trade in ideas.	Degenerates into a fearsome chase movie.	What a Fun Ride, I think it's Bay's Best!	The first half is high-quality science fiction, the rest is a high-tech chase adventure with a gleeful yen for destructive thrills.	A clone of THX 1183, Coma, and Logan's Run, The Island is another loud and bombastic Michael Bay movie where explosions and chases matter more than characters, dialogue, or plot.
What it's missing, ironically, is the edge that's made Mortal Kombat the video game such a powerful icon in American pop culture.	The most intriguing is a glassy-eyed follower whose right hand shoots out a hissing reptile that can extend itself for miles. Exotic creatures like these make watching Mortal Kombat feel like being in a high-tech fun house.	British director Anderson does a fair job with what he was given: four good-looking leads, some very impressive sfx, Babylonian sets, a bone-crunching soundtrack, and a battery of well-choreographed fights.	All the head-crushing and thigh-flexing doesn't compensate for the monotony of a story that simply traipses from one combat (sorry, kombat) to the next.	Cheesy with no nutrients. But hey, anything's better than Street Fighter.	Despite an effective otherwordly atmosphere and appropriately cheesy visuals, Mortal Kombat suffers from its poorly constructed plot, laughable dialogue, and subpar acting.
It's nice to see a teen comedy put the story ahead of the gag, and while it may result in more snickers than laugh-out-loud moments, it also makes for a better movie.	Stone really does rock Easy A, making Gluck's valentine to Hughes into something lovable in its own right.	Such an unconventionally smart, funny and delightful teen comedy that it's like a breath of fresh air. It's this year's Mean Girls.	Emma Stone's secular heroine stands up to her detractors in this discriminative and cliché heavy teen comedy.	Stone really does rock Easy A, making Gluck's valentine to Hughes into something lovable in its own right.	It owes a huge debt to older (and better) teen comedies, but Easy A proves a smart, witty showcase for its irresistibly charming star, Emma Stone.
In pursuing its aesthetic agenda so single-mindedly, the movie leaves the characters behind in the muck.	It does manage to generate enough empathy for the three central figures to keep audiences engaged well past the half-way point.	Without question, the film could have been a bit shorter, especially towards the end, but Eureka is a powerful, luxurious study of lives changed in the aftermath of violence.	The first film this year in which there is obvious greatness.	Eureka is, in its very long run, well worth the investment of time.	With its subtitles and a running time nearing four hours, Eureka certainly places demands upon its viewers. For those with the patience, however, this visually lovely film builds to an emotionally resonant vision of transcendence.
What a fun movie!	A fun little action romp that will play well with the audience it is aiming for -- so long as they don't go in with any major expectations.	Exasperatingly senseless, silly thriller weighed down with absurd action and overblown violence.	the script became a jumble of disjointed scenarios that prolongs the agony with inanity that fails to work even within the confines of very, very black comedy	The sharp dialogue is too often drowned out by the incessant explosions and automatic weapons fire.	Although this action-romance suffers from weak writing and one too many explosions, the chemistry generated by onscreen couple Pitt and Jolie is palpable enough to make this a thoroughly enjoyable summer action flick.
Like a lot of movies, but especially foreign films, "The Lunchbox" has a central idea and winning characters, and it builds a compelling situation.	Like pineapple raita, The Lunchbox is sweet and savory, although its ending invites anxiety, like a too-spicy curry.	This long-distance love story is comfort food in any language, perfectly agreeable and unlikely to surprise.	The Lunchbox is a first feature for director Ritesh Batra, but it nicely captures the almost overwhelming crush and noise of contemporary India, and it plays cleverly and delicately with the tension of whether its two correspondents might eventually meet.	By time credits roll on The Lunchbox, to call it at a rom-com trivializes what is a far more textured picture.	Warm, affectionate, and sweet but not cloying, The Lunchbox is a clever crowd-pleaser from first-time director Ritesh Batra.
Here's something you don't see very often: a movie that knows exactly what it is, and knows you know it too.	...an entertaining action film which seems to be taking place in an alternate universe.	This is a sleek, wet, near noir, with neon and shadows aplenty. Essentially, it's really rather good.	Brawls that are exciting in the beginning become dull as each sequence attempts to outdo the last. But John Wick has a more interesting story and better fights than most, not to mention, if too briefly, a puppy.	When Reeves, who seems to be challenging Cruise in the 'what, me 50?' do-my-own-stunts department, gets back in gear, he's like a ghost warrior, twirling, rolling, spinning, stabbing, firing on all cylinders so quickly he's gone before the bodies drop.	Stylish, thrilling, and giddily kinetic, John Wick serves as a satisfying return to action for Keanu Reeves -- and what looks like it could be the first of a franchise.
Too unstructured for its own good.	It succeeds, if unevenly.	Granted that On the Outs doesn't explore any new realms of destitute city life but it still contains unspeakable moments of desolation and disillusionment.	Guerilla storytelling on a profound level.	An attention-grabbing showcase for three promising actresses in sharply drawn lead roles.	With powerful lead performances, this gritty docudrama about the desperate lives of three young women in Jersey City packs an emotional wallop.
... neither funny, charming or anything else that will make it a memorable hour and a half of viewing pleasure.	After these 97 minutes, resting in peace sounds pretty good.	The Ghosts of Romantic Comedies Past must have visited writer/director Jeff Lowell as he pounded out the screenplay.	The tale [falls] short on imagination.	starts out badly, gets much worse, and then after it is just dull for a while, it veers off into a whole new category of awful.	With few laughs and little romantic chemistry, Over Her Dead Body lacks the ingredients of a successful romantic comedy.
This overlong but absorbing murder mystery, adapted from the first of a best-selling trilogy by the late journalist-turned-crime writer Stieg Larsson, dabbles in some pretty dark material.	It's the tender rapport that develops between Lisbeth and the older Blomqvist that sustains our interest in this violent, overlong film.	A stylish mystery that both conforms to the genre and departs from it in interesting ways.	Everyone has secrets in the The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a mind-bending and mesmerizing thriller that takes its time unlocking one mystery only to uncover another, all to chilling and immensely satisfying effect.	Despite some flaws, it's worth seeing this well-executed, well-acted Swedish murder mystery, which broke box office records; you're not likely to face such a tough, outrageous (anti)heroine in any American film	Its graphic violence and sprawling length will prove too much for some viewers to take, but Noomi Rapace's gripping performance makes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo an unforgettable viewing experience.
It's wonderful	A fine and original movie that touches on a damaged lead character with grace. And, duh, Fargo fans should be especially intrigued.	Kumiko's unique vision makes for humour and pathos in David Zellner's film.	With an airiness that recalls both Jarmusch and at-times the aforementioned Coens, Zellner tightrope-walks between whimsical and gravid.	The filmmaking team of David and Nathan Zellner... have channeled Kumiko's visionary madness into a memorable, haunting and highly original American movie.	Powerfully acted and lovely to look at, Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter offers a treat for cinephiles with a taste for the pleasantly peculiar.
For all its technical wonders, Dinosaur is strictly kids' stuff.	The story doesn't matter much when a movie looks this good, and it's a breakthrough of technical achievement.	A skillful blend of old-fashioned Disney storytelling and newfangled computer animation makes for an effective and frequently spectacular summer family film.	Visually powerful, yet depressingly cold and clinical.	The movie makes us feel there are real perils in the struggle to survive the predators, and that visceral sense of danger keeps us on edge.	While Dinosaur's plot is generic and dull, its stunning computer animation and detailed backgrounds are enough to make it worth a look.
The psychological mind-games are played to the hilt, the pressurised cabin air increases the edge-of-the-seat tension and the 85-minute flight time is gratifyingly short.	A good measure of the movie's white-knuckle fun comes from Craven's old-hand familiarity with the way thrillers tick, predicated on the smallest and most banal of missed connections, the kind that get an audience to go crazy.	A mostly smart scary movie, Red Eye effectively updates the slasher flick to address current fears.	For a movie getting unceremoniously released during the dog days of the summer movie season, Red Eye deserves a look.	superbly sustained tension... makes the fights between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' look like innocent roughhousing.	With solid performances and tight direction from Wes Craven, Red Eye is a brisk, economic thriller.
...doesn't cut the mustard as a time warp movie, which will disappoint the men, although it does get passing grades as a romance, which will please the ladies.	...an effective romance...	The Lake House is made of glass, but the view straight through it is rather pleasant all the same.	A bit too moody and metaphysical for its own good.	The joy lies in getting there, with lush visual direction by Alejandro Agresti and appealing performances by Ms. Bullock and her old Speed co-star Keanu Reeves.	The plot of The Lake House is a little too convoluted, and the film fails to pull off the sweeping romance it aims for.
The cinematic equivalent of a meal high in calories and low in nutrition...dresses up a weak narrative in a glitzy explosion of technical virtuosity intended to conceal its shortcomings.	It's scatty and fast paced, and director Neil Burger employs some Gaspar Noé-style, bad-trip CG effects to heighten the mood.	It would be curious to see the four or five endings the makers of Limitless came up with before they settled for this one, which is smeared with the fingerprints of test audiences and focus groups.	What's the fun in worrying about losing your soul when you can gain the world?	Limitless' highs are sustained and visually snappy, a David Fincher-esque vision of New York conquered. But the side effects are a little troubling.	Although its script is uneven, Neil Burger directs Limitless with plenty of visual panache, and Bradley Cooper makes for a charismatic star.
Alex Gibney's film, like Wright's book, is a useful contribution to what looks more and more like an urgent social priority: the push to discourage people from praising the chains that bind them.	Going Clear penetrates the nature of faith to confront anxious questions about why any of us believe the things we do.	There is little breaking news in Going Clear, but the film is eye-opening for those who haven't seen past reports.	For a group with property assets in the billions, it's a major piece of the puzzle, revealing a critical failing: For a religion with so much to give, why do they do so little for so few?	Alex Gibney shakes the Scientology tree in his crackling film version of Lawrence Wright's nonfiction bestseller.	Thoroughly disquieting but impossible to ignore, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a searing investigative work from a master documentarian.
I have a sneaking suspicion that [this] is a huge put-on, the latest jape from Christopher Guest and his merry band of mockumentary tricksters.	If this had been an IMAX film, it could have been even more spectacular. It could also have been forty-five minutes shorter.	If you're not a fan of the sport, this docu-mercial will be mostly uphill.	They're amazing athletes.	A sweet primer, not only into the history of snowboarding, but into the minds and lifestyles of some of the key participants in the sport.	This snowboarding doc scores with its dazzling array of snowboarding stunts and beautiful scenery, but loses points with shameless product placement and an overlong runtime.
I enjoyed it, though as a casual fan who also dug the Tenacious D album and DVD, I don't know how it'll play for newcomers.	The film's as big and flawed as the band itself. But just like any concertgoer wants their favorite band to pull out all the stops, so too will every D fanatic want another hour of this rambling, pumped-up and psyched-out acid trip of a film.	starts out inspired ... ends up sort of lame, obvious, and kind of tired,	Some of the jokes are apparently recycled from the D's HBO show, but if you're hard-core enough to notice, it shouldn't matter-even the greatest band in the world has to play the hits for the fans.	These guys are very funny, but I have a feeling that deep down they wouldn't mind if you took them seriously.	Tenacious D fan will find this movie hilarious; everybody else will see only a low-brow concept movie and a small assembly of jokes stretched past the 100 minute mark.
The target audience should go home wanting a surfboard for Christmas.	And although this film wants to invite the invigorating spirit of a competitive female-oriented sporting fable, Blue Crush simply rides the waves in mediocrity while achieving no real sense of splashy excitement despite its scenic vibrancy.	Affable yet forgettable...	This North Shore for girls has plenty of good vibrations, like stars Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, Mika Boorem and even a real surfer chick, Sanoe Lake.	It's inoffensive, cheerful, built to inspire the young people, set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery, it's about as exciting as a sunburn.	The surfing sequences are exhilarating, but the plot is pretty forgettable and trite.
To call the humor sophomoric would be to overstate its sophistication. Call it infantile, and you'll be much closer to the mark. But it's hard to deny that many of the more outrageous bits have an exhilaratingly potent, shock-you-into-guffawing impact.	If ever a studio film was released in theaters with the power of making audience members puke all over themselves, this is it.	Only adolescent boys -- the movie's target audience, despite a well-earned R rating -- will appreciate the most extreme gross-out gags, none of which can be described in a family newspaper.	The material alternates between nauseatingly grotesque and frighteningly cruel, with only a smidgen of humorous Trigger Happy TV-like asides to quell the torture.	The jackass films were made for the sole purpose of getting a crowd of drunken lunkheads together for a night of brainless hilarity. Nothing more, nothing less.	Better than any sequel to a movie of a television show has a right to be, Jackass: Number Two dares you not to laugh.
Jim Jarmusch, the king of indie cool, strikes another blow against the empire...	There's enough excitement in this dark, violent saga of a modern samurai at war with a family of aging Jersey gangsters to attract more than the art house crowd.	Is there a market for self-consciously stylish movies about gangsters if the films operate in what seems like slow-motion?	Visually creative film with a remarkable use of color and music.	Ghost Dog intersperses the rules and regulations of two disparate groups, the Mafia, to dramatize the decline of the old loyalties...	An innovative blend of samurai and gangster lifestyles.
This shrill, undermotivated, feature-length catfight between Jennifer Lopez's demure prospective bride and Fonda's unhinged prospective mother-in-law makes sure to underline, boldface and exclamation-point every plot turn and line of dialogue.	Tired comedy pits Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda against each other ... and the audiences loses.	Fonda doesn't work out.	Another generic concept-driven romantic comedy that is high on concept, low on comedy and about as romantic as a prenuptial agreement.	it's safe to say there is not one surprising or memorable moment in the bland "Monster-In-Law."	While Jane Fonda steals the movie in her return to the screen, a tired script and flimsy performances make this borderline comedy fall flat.
Along with this sobering information, filmmaker Irena Salina's docu includes a distinct note of optimism that should help the film flow smoothly through the festival pipeline before eventually settling on DVD.	I have already stopping buying a bottle a day to bring to the office.	The inconvenient truth at the center of Flow: For Love of Water is that while the oil crisis is intensely debated and documented, disasters involving an even more essential fluid go perilously unnoticed.	Your tap water might be making you sick. But your bottled water might be making you sicker, while also enabling the environmental rape of the American heartland and unconscionable extortion in the Third World.	Before ending on a somewhat hopeful note of defiant activism, Irena Salina's globe-hopping documentary is a terrifying downer.	Flow is an informative, disturbing and enthralling film that highlights a criminally underreported problem.
Arguably, the greatest horror film of the past thirty years.	Halloween brilliantly uses its widescreen frame, a lot of hand-held camerawork, and scary foreground and background action.	John Carpenter's 1978 tour de force, perhaps the most widely imitated film of the 70s.	Regardless of how silly you think it all is, this will have you scared witless by the time the end credits roll; low budget horror hog heaven.	Perhaps not quite so resonant as Psycho to which it pays due homage, but it breathes the same air.	Scary, suspenseful, and viscerally thrilling, Halloween set the standard for modern horror films.
A classic case of preaching to the converted, this relentlessly boring movie is unlikely to appeal to anyone except hard-core fans of Christian sci-fi.	The storytelling is heavy-handed, the plot convoluted, the direction inconsistent, the acting wooden and the effects cheesy.	Neither as bad you might fear nor as good as you might hope.	Might be extremely effective while preaching to the converted, but it's no great shakes as secular entertainment.	The almost total absence of anything that actually looks like a narrative is one of Left Behind's issues, but it's not, honestly, one of the biggest.	Poor production values, slow pacing, and an implausible story makes Left Behind a movie only for the faithful.
This is a movie that rests on its two leads. Allen and Costner play their parts like injured predators licking each other's wounds. They are magnificent, and they are healing.	What's best about Upside is its gonzo-sitcom craziness, a situation that lends itself to enjoyable performances.	...generates enough moments to be recommended to anyone looking for a engaging, adult drama with a little alcohol mixed in for fun.	The movie offers smug observation posing as insight and judgment posing as sympathy.	'The Upside of Anger' demonstrates the downside of moviemaking.	A comedy/ drama for grown-ups, with fine performances by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner.
The Office meets Annie Hall meets Night of the Living Dead.	Pedestrian direction and script sap what anarchic fun this movie could've been	...the second half of the film is just a standard horror movie showdown with a few mildly amusing gags.	Amid all the blood and gore -- and laughs -- Shaun also has something to say.	Nightmarish for all the right reasons.	Shaun of the Dead cleverly balances scares and witty satire, making for a bloody good zombie movie with loads of wit.
While Tall Dark can be a tad stilted, taking place as it does in Allen's fictionalized universe, most of it functions so smoothly it makes you forget about all the strings being pulled	A lively and funny ensemble comedy with yet another intriguing mix of stars and lesser-known talents playing deeply flawed human beings in search of love and fulfillment.	Allen has said he makes films as they offer him a distraction, and he has created just that: An enjoyable but instantly forgettable distraction.	I'm starting to think Allen makes movies like he files his tax returns. Some years business is fantastic, other years it's struggling. But he still files one every year. This year, business was so-so.	We never get a critical sense from Allen that this movie was worth making in the first place. It's a work of habit more than inspiration.	It's sporadically amusing, and typically well-cast, but You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger isn't one of Woody Allen's more inspired late-period efforts.
A vulgar, happy-as-cancer aberration that takes the dysfunctional family idea to a new low. Whimsical, yes. Happy, never.	Other than the guest-starring appearance of Cy Twombly canvases, nothing distinguishes this poor relation of The Savages from all the other emotionally fraudulent Amerindies about familial dysfunction and reconciliation.	It works more often than it doesn't, but it never quite goes where you expect. And that's rare enough to be noteworthy.	one of those awkwardly pretentious attempts to seem hip and profound by simply depicting people acting really goofy	What's worse, the super-tired plot or the pretentious daydream asides? Despite Demi Moore and Parker Posey, the only time I was happy was when I was leaving the theater.	Replete with quirky indie cliches, Happy Tears wastes some fine performances from Demi Moore, Parker Posey, and Rip Torn on stale formula.
Unfortunately for every gag that DeNiro and Crystal pull off -- and they do have an effective comedic chemistry -- the script strands them in eddies of frivolity.	The laughs are frequent and full.	Director Harold Ramis keeps the gangsters real and funny at the same time.	This one does nicely for a fitfully funny rental.	A sitcom disguised as a movie!	Analyze This is a satisfying comedy with great performances by De Niro and Crystal.
Nutritional value may be nil, but its have-fun-by- poking-fun philosophy is a treat and can only improve your mental health.	Dey ultimately lets Chan down. If the legendary actor could have brought in old school chum Sammo Hung, he could have made this a great picture.	Succeeds in excitement where this week's other big release, Mission Impossible 2 failed.	This movie is not about plot (which is a shame because there might have been a good story to tell here), it's about fun Martial Arts action. And Mr. Chan as usual, delivers. Service with a smile.	The story is compelling enough on its own to make a good (albeit overdone) action flick.	Although the plot is really nothing to brag about, Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson work well together. The cinematography looks great, and Jackie delivers a hilarious performance. This is an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser.
The world doesn't need another empty genre exercise. But as Blue Ruin reminds us, it can always use more filmmakers of Saulnier's resourcefulness, sensitivity and quiet assurance.	You couldn't ask for a more unlikely avenger than the ill-equipped sort-of hero of Blue Ruin, and that's precisely why it's far, far more suspenseful than the typical violent revenge thriller.	A real trip.	One of the most masterful thrillers of the year.	To call Blue Ruin a revenge thriller is to sell this barbed-wire-sharp and altogether surprising American indie short.	Smart, stripped-down, and thrillingly grim, Blue Ruin proves that a well-told revenge story can still leave its audience on the edge of their seat.
Oh, Chicken Run is a good movie, no doubt. It's also fairly entertaining. But Oscar caliber?	If the Aardman menagerie strikes you as funny, the movie will too.	The stars of this fowl adventure also have hilarious foibles, eccentric habits, diverse personalities and a lot of spunk.	Filled with heroism, humor and heart, this wonderful film is a treat for the entire family.	While the average chicken may hold as much interest to you as a dead duck, this film's chickens are well-defined characters that make you laugh, feel worry for them, and then laugh even more.	Chicken Run has all the charm of Nick Park's Wallace & Gromit, and something for everybody. The voice acting is fabulous, the slapstick is brilliant, and the action sequences are spectacular.
...things just move quickly from one person's conflicts to another, with little momentum or feeling of satisfaction.	Insubstantial, predictable and often dull.	One of the hippest and most enjoyable movies of the 90s. This ROCKS!	Lovably sloppy.	A soundtrack in search of a movie, Empire Records is one teen-music effort that never finds a groove.	Despite a terrific soundtrack and a strong early performance from Renee Zellweger, Empire Records is mostly a silly and predictable teen dramedy.
The film grows on you.	Few films manage to be this light and hopeful without being drop-dead dumb.	Quite a piece of work.	For a movie about community and forgiveness, family and grace, Pieces of April is refreshingly unsappy.	Katie Holmes... gives her most subtle and audacious performance yet...	A delightful, heartfelt comedy.
When the film doesn't try to build up the usual suspense found in movies about competition, you sigh with relief.	An attractively unparochial drama with a bracing interest in excellence.	"A Brilliant Young Mind" is not the film you think it is. It's better.	X+Y is challenging, endearing, sweet, and romantic...all without breaking a sweat.	A charming, utterly lovely and brilliantly acted coming-of-ager.	A Brilliant Young Mind is tender and perceptive -- and intelligent enough to find a wealth of dramatic riches buried under well-trod narrative ground.
If there's such a thing as a kitchen-sink comedy, writer-director Lone Scherfig's sad but often very funny film is it.	A charming, life-affirming gem.	The mixture of drizzly Scottish bleakness and Scherfig's meandering Danish moodiness is too chicly depressive -- and, for the most part, too dull -- to bear.	The tricky, even contradictory tone, which would be a failing in most films, ends up making "Wilbur" even more endearingly odd.	I admire some of it. I liked the performances. I thought the script was slow and I thought it had kind of a dingy slow dull over all feel to it.	Despite its morbid subject matter, Wilbur is a charming and often funny film.
If the Malaysians made a comedy about the assassination of the president of the United States because of his opposition to slavery, it would seem approximately as funny to us as Zoolander would seem to them.	A light but sprightly spoof of celebrity, excess and self-absorbed silliness.	At times Zoolander threatens to disappear up its own catwalk, but it's often very funny stuff.	Stiller obviously intended this to be silly, mindless fluff. It seldom rises above dumb and boring.	A success -- if you like dumb fun.	A wacky satire on the fashion industry, Zoolander is one of those deliberately dumb comedies that can deliver genuine laughs.
Both subtle and formidably odd, and already you can feel an enthusiastic cult following forming.	It's an interesting idea that could have used a more experienced hand at the helm.	One of the best movies I've seen this year.	Each turns in great performances that keep the film interesting and fresh, despite the fact its content was lifted from the day-old rack at the Hollywood Food Market.	It's almost a surprise to find the villainy so real and three-dimensional.	This quirky little film about a gangster in therapy feels fresh and well-crafted.
Stuffed full of cliches and caricatures, the reigning one here being a large, blonde, over-muscled blockhead who feels no pain. If only audiences had the same advantage.	The Swedish-made 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' was such an engrossing thriller that any attempt to replicate its blend of chills and kinky delights would seem futile.	Alfredson directs with a perceptive eye and a roving camera, using oblique angles for a script that unfolds with programmatic efficiency.	While uneven, repetitive and occasionally nonsensical, The Girl Who Played With Fire still offers a fair dose of suspense and action for those who can stomach its brutal violence.	The satisfactions it offers are those of above-average serial television.	Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist remain extraordinarily well-suited to their roles, but the second installment in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy doesn't pack quite as much punch as the first.
Knappenberger argues that the case against Swartz was overzealously pursued in order to make an example of him and on the evidence presented here it's hard to disagree.	A documentary whose chief aims - at which it succeeds - are to mourn a fallen activist angel and rile audiences into rage.	The documentary's release as the net neutrality debate rages will only underscore what we have lost.	An essential - and enraging - documentary about the life, career, and death of Internet activist Aaron Swartz, a danger to corporate hegemony whose work could not be allowed to continue.	The film is far from a technical matter, fiercely promoting Swartz's legacy and challenging us with the same questions its central subject was compelled to ask.	Informative and enraging in equal measure, The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz uses its subject's tragic tale to deliver an impassioned call to action.
The comic payoff is slow to come and culminates in a kind of triumph-of-the-little-guy ending that only Frank Capra can pull off.	Carrey and Leoni don't achieve much chemistry, mostly because she's so busy playing straight man to his antics.	Fun With Dick and Jane is instantly forgettable. Heck, it's not even that much fun while you're watching it.	Over the top Carrey is best left in the past.	In Fun with Dick and Jane, despair means having to turn in your BMW and hocking the plasma TV set.	This muddled comedy has a few laughs, but never sustains a consistent tone.
A comic masterpiece of full rear male nudity.	A nifty bit of digital wizardry.	Clint, for all his good intentions and graceful aging, is in danger of overstaying his welcome.	As a director, Eastwood lets his stars have the stage, and given this opportunity, these actors prove that they still possess the Right Stuff.	Its heroes may be old, but the film feels delightfully fresh.	While the plot is overly cliched, the suberb acting by the stars (especially the tense interactions between Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones) and the spectacular special effects make this a movie worth seeing.
Spielberg's sharpest, brawniest, most bustling entertainment since Raiders of the Lost Ark and the finest of the season's action epics.	Cold and scattered, Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals. That's not vintage Spielberg and that, finally, is minimally satisfying.	This one blends the best aspects of the mature Spielberg's often warring personality.	A movie of haunting images and mindless thrills.	The result is uneven, particularly as a thriller, but with flashes of brilliance.	Thought-provoking and visceral, Steven Spielberg successfully combines high concept ideas and high octane action in this fast and febrile sci-fi thriller.
A seriously confused film that makes three or four passes at being a better one and doesn't complete any of them.	Ultimately, it seems more bland than bad.	A movie that tries to take us from heaven to hell but winds up leaving us in limbo: exasperated and dumfounded.	While watching The Beach, you'll feel every wave of water, every breeze of air, every ray of sunshine. But not much else.	The Beach is the kind of literary rubbish that makes you trace the patterns in the carpet while you're supposed to be watching the screen.	Critics say The Beach is unfocused and muddled, a shallow adaptation of the novel it is based on. Points go to the gorgeous cinematography, though.
Be prepared for a quiet, melancholy movie that provokes thought and contemplation.	Beautifully composed as the film is, it borders on preciousness.	Exquisitely crafted.	[Spring] probably represents the purest and most transcendent distillation of the Buddhist faith ever rendered on the screen.	An accomplished, contemplative work rooted in the philosophy of Buddhism.	A visually stunning and contemplative piece of work.
There's an audience for it, but it could have been funnier and more innocent.	Something to offend everyone.	Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans.	It's become abundantly clear that series star/writer/producer Ice Cube hasn't a clue as to why the first Friday became such a beloved cult classic in the first place.	Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star.	This Friday installment is more shapeless and stale than its predecessors.
Good '80's teen movie with a suitable soundtrack and the loveable Cruise displaying his new found starry confidence.	A classic! Welcome to stardom Mr. Cruise.	De Mornay does sterling work as the helpful hooker, but this is Cruise's big chance, and he relishes it, putting in a believable and likeable performance.	The roots of American Beauty can all be found in this groundbreaking film.	It's funny because it deals with subjects that are so touchy, so fraught with emotional pain, that unless we laugh there's hardly any way we can deal with them -- especially if we are now, or ever were, a teenage boy.	Featuring one of Tom Cruise's best early performances, Risky Business is a sharp, funny examination of teen angst that doesn't stop short of exploring dark themes.
It is a keenly observed movie about loss of identity and finding love, in which Brooks serves up funny-ouch humor with slapstick heartbreak.	Clever lines and a fine performance by Owen Wilson aren't enough to redeem this flat and oddly unnerving comedy.	"How Do You Know" is a complete misfire from famed writer/director James L. Brooks.	I expected this movie to be better.	It is not funny; it is not heartwarming. It has all the zesty champagne fizz of Pepto-Bismol.	How Do You Know boasts a quartet of likeable leads -- and they deserve better than this glib, overlong misfire from writer/director James L. Brooks.
The Wachowskis have served up passable entertainment... but they fail to deliver on their own mythology.	A plodding, lifeless and leaden final chapter with little of the gosh-wow action that made the first two installments so enjoyable.	The Wachowskis lay on the spiritual allegory thick, but the film's fragile, better-than-here hopefulness is genuinely unsettling.	I'm warning you: don't see this film--because whatever third movie you envisioned in your head, no matter how lame, has got to be better than this.	The third film in the series, while not quite as good as the first film, does bring the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.	A disappointing conclusion to the Matrix trilogy as characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects.
It's a savage, breezy, occasionally obscene and sometimes poignant mix of comedy and crime.	The movie's writer-director, Richard Shepard, balances the macabre and the sentimental, and understands that although his film contains questions like 'don't successful people always live with blood on their hands?' its real subject is friendship.	It's easy to tell how much Brosnan relished this particular role as he practically licks his lips in pleasure after nailing key scenes.	in an ideal world, The Matador would be the movie to watch on a late Friday afternoon to start relaxing for the weekend	The film rapidly devolves into a lame buddy picture, part thriller, mostly goof.	This humorously amoral, oddball comic thriller features strong performances by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear as a flamboyant, aging hit-man and an out of work suburban businessman, respectively.
A true-life tale of inadvertent self-destruction, Deep Water's generic title belies its haunting incisiveness.	But more startling are the original tape recordings and 16mm films made by the solitary competitors as they spent more than ten months alone trying to sail around the globe.	With the discovery of films and audiotape from the first solo, non-stop nautical race around the globe, Deep Water promises to take us where we have never been.	One of the year's best documentaries.	The film evokes a visceral understanding of solitude at sea.	Equal parts mystery and biography, Deep Water is both an engrossing documentary and an affecting treatise on human folly and obsession.
[The Black Cauldron is] too dark and scary for younger children, and it's too silly and childish for older viewers to embrace.	It's quite good, though by the impossible standards the film sets for itself it inevitably falls short.	Middle road Disney animation, unmemorable.	By the end of The Black Cauldron I was remembering, with something of a shock of nostalgia, the strength and utter storytelling conviction of the early Disney animators. The Black Cauldron is a return to the tradition.	This is the 25th full-length animated feature from Walt Disney studios, and professionally put together as it is, many of the ingredients may seem programmed to those who have seen some of the others.	Ambitious but flawed, The Black Cauldron is technically brilliant as usual, but lacks the compelling characters of other Disney animated classics.
Like an insane cur endlessly chasing its own tail, Alpha and Omega spins inward until it finally implodes	'Alpha and Omega' enters the crowded marketplace with little to say for itself.	Because of the lacklustre rom-com script and flaccid direction - not to mention the terror on kids' faces with the snarling wolves slaughtering stampeding caribou - wait to howl with the DVD.	Alpha and Omega is one of those rarities in the modern era of Hollywood animation: bad.	Stumbles every time it attempts to rise above the perfunctory, with its tiresome comic-relief geese and bog-standard internecine rivalry in the wolf pack.	With bland visuals and a dull, predictable plot, Alpha and Omega is a runt in 2010's animated litter.
A witty and highly imaginative historical fiction, well adapted by screenwriter Peter Shaffer from his own hit play. [Blu-ray]	As Mozart, Tom Hulce, though extremely American in looks and voice, gets better and better as the drama progresses.	An Academy Award winning film about a composer in the Austrian court whose life and career are derailed by resentment over the talent and success of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.	Remarkable fictional account of Mozart's life. One of the best films of its decade.	Director Milos Forman ... gives Tom Hulce free reign to portray the world's most sublime composer as a drunken, selfish fool giggling his way into the ears of Vienna.	A lavish, entertaining, powerful film about the life and influence, both positive and negative, of one of Western culture's great artists.
I found myself glancing at my watch almost as often as I did when I was sitting through a truly terrible movie called The Island.	The best of the films.	The storytelling is the series' best, with a zingy balance of drama, humor, and Deep Thoughts.	The younger actors are now more confident.	A superior motion picture!	Dark, sinister, but ultimately even more involving than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels.
Imagine the worst Deadwood episode ever, and you'll get an idea of the general tone of Beowulf & Grendel.	Icelandic-shot version of the legendary revenge saga is visually arresting and plausibly retrofitted for modern consumption, but lacks the savage bite that might have given the sixth century-set tale real impact.	ridiculous	Sturla Gunnarsson's film ultimately lacks the grandeur and wit necessary to make the legend fully come alive.	This movie won't be to everyone's taste, but it will certainly bedevil some dreams.	Despite the impressive Icelandic scenery, Beowulf And Grendel fails to find its footing in the transition from epic tale to the big screen.
Cassandra's Dream, Woody Allen's latest excursion to the dark side of human nature, is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn't just stop making comedies once and for all.	This no-fuss, bare-bones crime drama is old-fashioned in a way that's crisp and refreshing...	If you must see only one film about a family's downward spiral into despair, it probably should be Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, not Cassandra's Dream.	Strong performances, especially from the never-better Farrell. This might be the first time I've watched him and not been completely distracted by that big black caterpillar above his eyes.	Although McGregor and Farrell produce some occasionally spirited moments, particularly in the earlier scenes, they are little more than walking and talking schemes, their choices based entirely on socioeconomic impulses.	Colin Farrell and Tom Wilkinson act up a storm in Cassandra's Dream, but Woody Allen's heavy-handed symbolism and foreshadowing drains the plot of all tension.
A solid war movie with a great performance by Lee Marvin. If you're a war buff, give this one a shot.	meant to be the culmination of a life's work... It didn't come to pass.	Until "Saving Private Ryan," this film was the most graphic WWII picture made.	Alas, the lost version of Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One of 1980 has been found -- reassembled, actually, by the distinguished film critic Richard Schickel -- and it's a lot less than legendary. It isn't even very good.	The film's overriding mission is to expose both the inherent absurdity and tragedy of war.	The reconstruction of Samuel Fuller's epic account of his days in North Africa in World War II elevates the film into the pantheon of great war movies.
The film packs a hell of a punch!	Brutal, provocative!	The film's most incongruous and embarrassing scene is a black-on-white basketball game: shot like a Nike ad, it trivialises the subject.	One of the best told movies of the year!	...a brutal and disturbing movie that discusses and demonstrates racism, prejudice, and human blindness.	A compelling and provocative story led by an excellent performance by Edward Norton.
McCarthy has honed her particular brand of comedy to a fine edge and proven she has a considerable arsenal to draw from; but she's also reached the point where she's drawing from what she feels comfortable doing as opposed to reaching for new levels.	Action spoof is hilarious but raunchy and violent.	I could watch Melissa McCarthy and Rose Byrne insult each other for days.	Everything about "Spy" works which makes it the one to beat as the best comedy of the year.	Feig's cheerfully feminist script makes only as much sense as it absolutely must, while providing McCarthy with chances to crack wise, show vulnerability and class, and do some of the more elegant pratfalls you'll have seen in a while.	Simultaneously broad and progressive, Spy offers further proof that Melissa McCarthy and writer-director Paul Feig bring out the best in one another -- and delivers scores of belly laughs along the way.
Johansson's vocal tour de force is award-worthy. So is the movie. Ignore the soft ending. Jonze is a visionary whose lyrical, soulful meditation on relationships of the future cuts to the heart of the way we live now.	Brilliantly done, inspired acting but the one-note plot has nowhere to go.	The best things in the movie aren't transporting or diverting but merely incite intellectual recognition: Yes. OK. That's amusing.	It's melancholy, moving and unmissable.	"Her" is the "Gravity" of inner space.	Sweet, soulful, and smart, Spike Jonze's Her uses its just-barely-sci-fi scenario to impart wryly funny wisdom about the state of modern human relationships.
Stealth is so over-painted with CGI that it doesn't look as real as the sequence starring Shepard that inspired it in The Right Stuff, a movie made with model airplanes.	Overlong, disjointed, and rarely compelling, Stealth has the capacity to put viewers into a catatonic state.	I'm not sure if I should club it to death or hug it.	Stealth is flimsy and forgettable, but it does have a few worthy action and special-effects sequences.	[A] hilariously absurd slice of American cheese...	Loud, preposterous, and predictable, Stealth borrows heavily and unsucessfully from Top Gun and 2001.
It would have been nice if the audience had been treated to some originality. Wishful thinking I guess.	It's harmless, diverting fluff. But it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre.	A diverting trifle that will amuse you while it's on the screen, then fade from memory while the final credits roll.	Not terrible, but not memorable, Maid in Manhattan delivers what you'd expect: mediocre, get-out-your-hankies romantic fare.	The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon, extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away.	Too blandly generic, Maid in Manhattan also suffers from a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Fiennes.
Kirsten Dunst is marvelous as the most adventuresome of the girls, and Josh Hartnett is fine as the high school hunk.	Spunky directing debut by Sofia Coppola unfortunately plays like after-school special.	Sofia Coppola's compelling, ethereal fable about adolescent loss of innocence is claustrophobic and uncomfortable, but profoundly affecting and gently funny. "The Virgin Suicides" advises teen years are sometimes best remembered as a long-ago vacation.	I can't quite give the movie a negative review, because I do concur with the critical consensus that Coppola has made an impressive directorial debut.	More than most recent movies about suburban adolescence, The Virgin Suicides catches both the triviality and the grandeur of youth, its prosaic details and its mythopoetic flights.	Sofia's successful directorial debut lies in the movie's compelling story and the actors' genuine emotions.
This first film by writer/director Jonathan Kasdan reveals him to have a good ear for dialogue and the foibles of growing into adulthood. With the inclusion of greater originality in his plotlines, he should grow into a director to watch.	Shows very little respect for women and makes a youthful male soft-core porn writer into a supposed seer dispensing wisdom.	Kasdan's clueless psychological insight leaves [Ryan] stranded.	Ah, poor poor Carter. Will he emerge strengthened or diminished by his encounters in this faraway land?	The O.C. may be over, but Adam Brody isn't.	While pleasantly acted, In the Land of Women is a dramatically stilted film with underdeveloped characters.
Had it not been for the homosexual content this script would have been considered too crappy to film	There's a cinematic tradition that movies taking their titles from pop songs turn out to be bombs. 'Imagine Me & You' upholds it.	A witty and immensely enjoyable British romantic comedy.	Settles disappointingly for rom-com cliches. It doesn't even bother to explore its own premise.	The film sidesteps the usual love triangle romantic comedy formula of hurling itself into all-out praise of fresh, vibrant infatuation by treating it as a zero-sum game that requires a loser.	Aside from its lesbian theme, Imagine Me & You can only offer more of the same generic rom-com cliches.
Mini is impossible to like, especially since she delivers some of the worst narration ever spoken, and her final lines are like a big middle finger to viewers foolish enough to enjoy the film.	Mini's First Time unfortunately degenerates into a sexed-up version of a Law & Order episode.	Mini has a cleverly devious wrap-around ending, but you have been warned: It's twisted.	Mini's First Time is Bret Easton Ellis territory with palm trees, explored by smarmy blunderers.	Touches fleetingly on an interesting phenomenon - namely, the manner in which a father's advances simultaneously disgust and enthrall his teenage stepdaughter.	This black comedy wavers between sleaze and satire, without ever fully committing to either.
A rotten, stupid film, without a hint of cleverness or imagination.	How can a car that winks compete with Shrek or Buzz Lightyear? Couldn't producers have given Herbie a goatee or sticker of Calvin peeing on Kit from Knight Rider.	As the movie's title implies he's been updated, now he's possessed by the Devil.	A more-than-acceptable timewaster for both the jungle-gym set and their captive chaperones.	Harmless, witless, unoriginal, uninventive, mildly entertaining and not liable to do any permanent damage to anyone who watches it.	Herbie: Fully Loaded is a decent kids movie that is pretty undemanding for adult viewers.
Few films delight the eye the way Vincent Ward's What Dreams May Come does!	It's not much, other than the vision thing.	In both concept and execution, they testify to painfully banal sensibilities.	The pedantic script's tedium is more than offset by the handsomeness of the production.	Muddled and confused!	An insubstantial plot overshadows the beautiful, surreal scenery.
Spartacus actually is pretty decent, and worth watching 10 times before giving the far inferior Gladiator a look.	...a passable historical epic that has little in common with the rest of Kubrick's output...	the liberal message is delivered with a heavy hand, but the film also boasts some stirring action and intelligent dialogue.	An absolute classic by one of the great American directors.	Thrilling epic is too intense for the youngest.	Featuring terrific performances and epic action, Kubrick's restored swords-and-sandals epic is a true classic.
Works better on television.	For all their rambunctious energy and rebellion, these kids are innocents out of a 1950s sitcom and the film steers clear of the adult in-jokes and bodily function humor that litters so many recent family films.	A misstep or two aside, you don't have to be a MENSA member to know that kids are going to enjoy it.	One of those movies that you watch when you've got nothing better to do, munching jelly babies and smiling at the exuberance on the screen	As frothily entertaining as this caper is, it's unlikely to prove as popular with grown-ups as Shrek and the Toy Story movies.	What Jimmy Neutron lacks in computer animation, it makes up for in charm and cleverness.
Cold Weather is not without its charm but it really does test the patience of the viewer.	Some will respond to the film's mumbling minimalism and there is something mildly heart-warming in seeing aimless individuals gaining a sense of purpose.	Utterly delightful mumblecore mystery that plays like a slacker version of Sherlock Holmes and is by turns gripping, moving and laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to a superb script, engaging characters and terrific performances.	Ambitious, if not always satisfying.	The movie does have a charm that develops gradually.	For viewers who manage to stay invested in its occasionally aimless story, Cold Weather proves a surprisingly sophisticated blend of mumblecore and indie noir.
The Da Vinci Code is Exhibit A in how things that work on the page don't always translate on-screen.	...sporadically engaging but mostly dull...	It is simply one of those movies which may have been made with the best of intentions but tries to appeal to too many people to be remotely interesting.	The film is faithful enough, but it's hard to imagine it making many converts.	Duh Vinci Code is brain-free summertime escapism.	What makes Dan Brown's novel a best seller is evidently not present in this dull and bloated movie adaptation of The Da Vinci Code.
May be the most raw and visceral cinematic portrayal of infatuation I've ever seen, with nearly every shot conveying aching, unrequited desire.	It's part of a very specific genre of slightly pretentious, slightly irrelevant Nouvelle Vague throwbacks that are nonetheless pretty decent. And this is the decentist I've seen in some time. Dolan, I salute you.	That Dolan has squeezed a feature out of a love triangle that ultimately may not even really exist speaks to the intensity of such an intimate experience.	"Heartbeats" charts its own course.	Girl likes boy who likes boy (or maybe he doesn't) sounds like that recent reality-TV scenario, but there's very little reality at play in this hollowed-out, tricked-up Montreal-based drama.	An art film to the max, Heartbeats intriguing and appealing premise is sometimes buried by director Xavier Dolan's filmmaking flourishes.
I'd like to be able to say they couldn't pay me to see this flick. Alas, it's apparent I can be bought, and pretty cheaply too.	Good Luck Chuck is the anti-Superbad.	There's an audience out there for this kind of thing, but if this is what passes for funny, what in the world of comedy doesn't qualify?	It's our dumb luck that this movie has be foisted upon us.	The cracking performances from Alba and Cook do wonders at papering over these creative fissures.	A shortage of laughs and an undercurrent of mean-spiritedness undermine Good Luck Chuck, squandering a decent premise on gross-out humor and shopworn slapstick.
Gripping, elusive and something to be experienced, Che Part Two continues to offer up surprises, frustration and - above all - fascination.	Twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been.	Meticulous in its showing of the nuts-and-bolts of jungle warfare, it may be the closest we'll ever get to an art-house action movie. As a tribute to Che, it beats a T-shirt.	His film is brilliantly shot, capturing the chilly bareness of the landscapes through which the rebels yomp, but it's formalist and clinical to a degree that will challenge viewers eager to identify with the figures it depicts.	After the exhilaration of Part One, the mood of Part Two seems somber, almost funereal, but it's integral to the story.	The second part of Soderbergh's biopic is a dark, hypnotic and sometimes frustrating portrait of a warrior in decline, with a terrific central performance from Del Toro.
The picture has one thing going for it: the element of surprise.	Um exemplo de tecnologia utilizada a serviço da história.	You might guess that this movie will feature yelling, at least once, 'Let's get the hell outta here!'	An entertainingly trashy and derivative carnivore spectacular!	A corny cornucopia of outrageous guffaws and giggles topped with spine-chilling thrills.	Aside from a few thrills, Deep Blue Sea is unoriginal and unintelligent.
A beautiful bore: Robin has daddy issues and Ridley Scott pushes income redistribution	Learning what made Hood is well and good, but couldn't that have taken 30 minutes, with the rest of the movie being about a wanted philanthropic criminal?	What this Robin Hood lacks in fun it makes up for in epic sweep.	Its $200-million budget is on the screen. This is a big-scale ambitious period epic in the 60s grand tradition. It seeks to retell a well-worn tale, to put old wine in a shiny new bottle.	You know you're in trouble when it takes two and a half hours for the legend to, well, begin.	Ridley Scott's revisionist take on this oft-told tale offers some fine acting and a few gripping action sequences, but it's missing the thrill of adventure that made Robin Hood a legend in the first place.
What fails as drama are the races themselves, shot front-on so that we don't know who's winning until the tape is breasted, but Hugh Hudson's decision to use slow motion and David Watkin's beautiful lighting lend them a proper heroic burnish.	As world events have proved time and again, this is a timeless story, rooted in an era long before anyone had thought of Spandex or terrorist attacks.	Despite its bombastic tendencies, Chariots has a healthy glow that's charming.	Chariots is a film for the ages.	Appreciation of this picture doesn't demand a love of sports, merely an understanding of human nature.	Decidedly slower and less limber than the Olympic runners at the center of its story, the film nevertheless manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes.
Trend setter, nostalgic, feel good hit	Lucas' direction is skilful and assured -- he follows several stories with wit and sensitivity -- and he's matched by his cast, the whole film perfectly evoking the end of an era.	Wonderfully evoking the feel and spirit of the era, this is one of those rare movies you live through rather than watch.	Lucas' sleeper hit...casts a rose-colored eye back to a placid pre-Vietnam America, a time when rock 'n' roll was young and hot rods were cool.	American Graffiti still bears the mark of a superb filmmaking talent.	One of the most influential of all teen films, American Graffiti is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of recent high school grads' last days of innocence.
Sabrina, much like its characters, follows conventions rather than challenges them.	It is a story as light as a feather and as old as yesterday's news, as transparent as a society column item and as smug as a foreign-made car. But Mr. Wilder...has made it into a commentary as crisp as a screed in a smart magazine.	Hampered by an unimaginative script ... nevertheless manages to be a thoroughly charming, delightfully romantic variation of the Cinderella story.	...a classy fairy tale, with plenty of sparkle amid the occasional fizz.	All in all, Sabrina is an intelligent, mildly entertaining also-ran.	With its humorous script and its stars' immense charm, Sabrina remains a resonant romantic gem.
Never boring but often exhausting, Australia finally pulls itself together for an emotionally satisfying ending. Or six. Pass the gravy.	You don't find many three-hour fairy tale love story war films about race relations featuring the ultra-competitive beef market in northern Australia. For good reason.	It almost goes without saying that the film looks gorgeous, but the filmmaking behind it feels unsure how to work on this grand a scale. Australia is big. But it never fills the screen.	Sumptuous and romantic, Australia is a gorgeous, ambitious epic achieved with Baz Luhrmann's inimitable style. Kidman and Jackman are at their best and awfully nice to look at. What's not to love?	The plot's key turning points have either too much or not enough emphasis and are often in the wrong spot.	Built on lavish vistas and impeccable production, Australia is unfortunately burdened with thinly drawn characters and a lack of originality.
Bland and witless.	Looking to follow the Cheaper By The Dozen formula to box office success, Yours, Mine & Ours is a tiresome kids comedy that's mostly loud and mean-spirited.	Regardless of a distinct lack of romantic chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, the able-bodied actors fulfill the slapstick demands of this run-of-the-mill family comedy based on the 1968 movie with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball.	Preposterous and not funny.	The script is not nearly clever or original enough and Gosnell's direction goes into panic mode each time he stages the chaos.	The initial set-up is unbelievable, the plotting is predictable and stale, and the comedy depends on repetitive pratfalls that soon get old.
It might have been a sharper comedy by facing its real subject -- corporate conformity and PC enforcement -- but Veber has made a snickering appeal for gay rights by topping it with hetero payoffs.	A bright and breezy piece.	We are left with a mildly amusing comedy and the lingering memory of a sterling cast that deserved better material.	Employs a remarkable range of talent in a story of wonderful comic invention and surprising dramatic depth.	Timely as it is funny.	A pleasant comedy with a great cast.
A very worthwhile adaptation of Wharton's novel.	In a sense, [Anderson is] perfect for the role of a woman who, as Selden describes her, 'has it in her to be whatever she believed to be.'	A well-crafted, well-acted film that showcases a top performance from Gillian Anderson.	Pierces the heart and mind with a tale and a treatment that feel all too painfully real.	Stick with the film, accept the rules of the time and the meditative rhythm of the language that Davies has woven into his story, and you won't be disappointed.	Despite being a period piece, The House of Mirth's depiction of social cruelty still feels chilling and relevant for today.
Funny enough that I'll refrain from describing the gags that made me laugh, lest I spoil them for you.	Its acutely observed triumph is also its undoing: It's hard to satirize oppressive tedium without becoming oppressively tedious. This movie's not low-key, it's no-key.	It's a cast of brilliant caricatures, and as such recalls the films of Wes Anderson.	Hess does creatively produce a droll gem that exudes a nerdy naughtiness worthy of exploring in all its deadpan deliciousness	The movie's deliriously specific detail, affection for its characters, unexpected developments, and genuine sweetness keep us laughing with Napoleon, not at him.	A charming, quirky, and often funny comedy.
...fun, even if most of it is based on cruelty and hardship.	It's funny in parts in a tasteless, Farrelly Brothers way. Freedy Johnston's incidental music provides one of the 90s most pleasing scores.	It's Bill Murray who easily swipes the picture -- he's at his unctuous best as Ernie McCracken, an oily bowler with an ego as enormous as his libido.	With maybe 25 belly laughs, the brazenly crude Kingpin is often uproarious, but be forewarned that its creators apparently conceived it underneath a limbo bar. How looow can a funny guilty pleasure go?	Has plenty of clever sight gags and outrageous jokes you can't help laughing at, no matter how hard you resist.	Kingpin has its moments, but they're often offset by an eagerness to descend into vulgar mean-spiritedness.
For the most part admirably chooses honest documentation over emotional manipulation.	Enjoyably upbeat and intelligently inspiring.	[E]xtraordinary in how it turns upside-down the typical feel-good, triumph-of-the-underdogs tropes of the subgenre...	It's a surprisingly moving, emotional film, even for those who (like me) know little of football; by its end, you just might be blinking away a few tears.	While "Undefeated" travels well-tilled inspirational ground, it's also an irresistible story of football, faith and the lust for happily-ever-after black-and-white endings.	It covers familiar sports documentary territory, but Undefeated proves there are still powerful stories to be told on the high school gridiron.
While it isn't as bad as it was initially built up to be, it is an early example of why videogames don't make good movies.	Bizarre, replete in often stunning special effects and verrrry strange from the outset, Super Mario Bros. is curiously entertaining, even though it often makes little sense.	Bombs explode, cars careen and crash, people leap from dimension to dimension in this blaring, glaring picture. Kids might get a charge out of the mayhem. I got the vapors.	They should have used cheat codes to make this a winner.	Scenery rushes by, noise blares, characters pop up wearing new costumes that they couldn't possibly have had time to change into as they eluded their adversaries.	Despite flashy sets and special effects, Super Mario Bros. is too light on story and substance to be anything more than a novelty.
Examines a variety of questions, such as superficiality versus substance, materialism versus self-worth, and taking advantage of others versus forming sincere relationships.	Bacri and Jaoui happens to have a soft spot for their countrymen, which results in a warm, funny movie for us to like, too.	Why this won the Best Screenplay award at the last Cannes festival escapes me.	Jaoui and Bacri skewer celebrity worship, sensitively explore women's body issues, delve into relationship dynamics and brilliantly examine the myriad ways people deceive themselves.	The plot, what little there is, moves at a snail's pace, and the subtitles don't help speed things along.	An observant drama-comedy about self absorption.
Inexpressibly ropey sci-fi thriller joylessly directed by John Woo and based, natch, on a Philip K Dick short story.	How sad to see John Woo churn out an action thriller so thoroughly generic.	Paycheck is bad enough that it may convince some movie-goers not to go to another film just because it was made by John Woo.	A mildly entertaining slice of science fiction that's anchored by some top-notch action.	How appropriate that Woo's awkward sci-fi nutty narrative is about memory loss seeing as though this convoluted clunker is utterly forgettable.	Though Dick's short story has an intriguing premise, Woo reduces it to a lot of meaningless chases, shoot-outs, and explosions.
Engaging drama that slowly gets under your skin, thanks to striking cinematography, a sparse but effective script and strong performances from its two young leads.	A poetic, tender and unflinchingly real love story. Its powerful visuals, music and raw, captivating performances will leave you feeling deeply moved.	The spiritual here is every bit as powerful as the physical.	There is a profound statement about love in this film -- a commitment to caring which goes way beyond the pleasure principle.	This sterling 2009 debut by Warwick Thornton is harrowing and tragic but has a stoic, stately realism that elevates the material way above victim politics.	Alternately beautiful and heartrending, Samson and Delilah is terrifically acted and shot, and presents a complex portrait of what it means to be Australian.
Look up in the sky: its a bird! its a plane! No.... its every single alien invasion movie rolled into one epic fan film. Mind you, it does have a wonderfully messed-up twist ending.	Maybe the Brothers Strause are to be admired for getting this cheesy trash into theaters instead of letting it be relegated to the SyFy Channel. They've got moxie, anyway.	Let me say upfront and with absolute clarity that Skyline is a bad film. So why don't I feel any animosity toward it? I guess because despite everything that was wrong with this film I still had fun and laughed more than I did at Due Date.	makes the cliche-riddled guilty pleasure of Independence Day seem like the second coming of 2001: A Space Odyssey	Delivers all the Saturday night whizz-bang and Sunday morning brain-ripping you could want.	A middling sci-fi entry, Skyline offers proof that solid special effects alone cannot overcome a flat storyline filled with uninspired dialogue.
Are excitable eight-year-olds - this movie's intellectual target audience - really going to wait another ten years before they can watch it legally?	Rubbish CGI, rubbish acting, rubbish storytelling. Throw in a few mutants and a better-than-it-deserves cast and you get this sci-fi timewaster.	There's lots of shooting, grenades exploding and things going bang and, even if the film gets bogged down by some needless religious mumbo-jumbo, the whole thing looks great in a grimy, Blade Runner kind of way.	There's no doubting the frenetic energy of Simon Hunter's steampunk thriller with its deft mixing of CGI and live action. The mutants are artforms of grotesqueness and truly terrifying.	But a screenplay that sounds like it was hewn from chunks of wood is a great leveller, so everyone comes out looking equally inept.	Bad acting, poor CGI and clunky script mean this sci-fi thriller is lacking in all departments including the thrills.
Gomorrha transcends its medium and evidences humanity at its most despicable, and rates as an unconventional and unmissable instant classic.	Drained of energy and vigor, Gomorrah confuses gangster fantasy for art.	Tinsel Town can indeed be blamed for making such 'made' man movies compelling. Director Matteo Garrone shows us how truly disturbing and unrelenting such a story can be.	Gomorrah is a thoroughly engaging, well directed crime drama with a strong script and terrific performances. Highly recommended.	Matteo Garrone's powerful and authentic Gomorra one of the most realistic films on organized crime to hit screens	Portraying organised crime with an unflinching realism, this gritty and searing Italian crime masterpiece pulls no punches.
Could Adam Shankman be the unlikely savior of the movie musical?	Takes the attitude of the original to a giddy new level.	This is born-again anti-establishmentarianism.	You'll come out of the movie happier than you went in, and humming a few peppy new tunes to boot.	Even though this exists to sell Zac Efron's face (squeal!), it's still worth watching for the peppy music, over-the-top acting and feeling that you've ingested a rather sweet after-school special.	Hairspray is an energetic, wholly entertaining musical romp; a fun Summer movie with plenty of heart. Its contagious songs will make you want to get up and start dancing.
Bobcat Goldthwait has established himself as a unique, if not prolific, voice in filmmaking.	It's almost too great a stretch to believe that Bobcat Goldthwait...could have become one of Hollywood's most interesting and daring writer/directors.	Sadly, the ending seems unsatisfying but the journey there is a funny one.	...bravely acted (especially by Robin Williams, who's much better in roles like these than when he's called on to be "funny") and invigoratingly dark.	A comedy of quite astonishing blackness.	World's Greatest Dad is a risky, deadpan, dark comedy that effectively explores the nature of posthumous cults of celebrity.
Denzel Washington and Chris Pine versus runaway train. That's enough, isn't it? How much more do you need?	High tension escapist entertainment - without a villain	With Scott's impeccable sense of cinematographic drama, working in tangent with a solid screenplay by Mark Bomback, this cinematic runaway train amps up the stakes with every new turn and twist of the track.	Unstoppable takes a simple premise and spins it into an entertaining film surging with pure energy.	Not since The Bone Collector (where he played a quadriplegic) has Denzel Washington spent so much screen time sitting on his ass.	As fast, loud, and relentless as the train at the center of the story, Unstoppable is perfect popcorn entertainment -- and director Tony Scott's best movie in years.
Hall does his best to make sense of Dane, but the plot turns simply don't add up. Good work in a not-so-good movie.	A twisty, brainy, patient thriller with guts and imagination, as well as a few big laughs. Rooted in genuine human curiosity and empathy, it quickly and easily gets under your skin.	The humid atmosphere is stronger than the writing.	The modern equivalent of the B movies that studios used to make, and it reminds you of how good many of them were.	Mickle's bracing sense of style and cinematographer Ryan Samul's moody visuals keep it gripping until the final bullet is fired.	Boasting plenty of twists, a suitably seedy tone, and a memorable supporting turn from Don Johnson, Cold in July proves an uncommonly rewarding thriller.
Goofy animal adventure is full of first-grade humor.	A rather tepid special-effects spy movie for kids, in the same vein as 'G-Force,' if you'll forgive the expression.	Acompletely unnecessary, nearly laughless sequel to the surprising 2001 hit, which stretched the one-joke, talking-animals concept as far as it could.	Nine years on from the first movie but somehow the effects have gone backwards and the charm has gone missing.	The film's target audience... is going to largely be much too young to have any first-hand experience with the James Bond tropes being satirised.	Dull and unfunny, this inexplicable sequel offers little more than the spectacle of digitally rendered talking animals with celebrity voices.
Another masterful piece of family entertainment from Pixar.	Fantastic animation, a great cast, and hilarious laughs make Finding Nemo a must see movie for the summer.	It's full of bright visuals, inventive animation and enough cute characters to fill, well, an ocean.	Lives up to Pixar's high standards for wildly creative visuals, clever comedy, solid characters and an involving story.	This is not the first time Pixar's animators have been engaged with the natural world, but they've never been as deeply immersed as they are in this undersea Fantasia.	Breathtakingly lovely and grounded by the stellar efforts of a well-chosen cast, Finding Nemo adds another beautifully crafted gem to Pixar's crown.
If a movie flirts with brave insight and settles for sweet comfort, that's still plenty nice.	Disarmingly truthful with a bittersweet centre, this highly observant exploration of the complex shades of a long marriage, complete with its tensions, biting barbs, playfulness and loving familiarity weaves an edgy tale	Smart, substantial and enchanting.	Le Week-End is a marital disintegration-reintegration drama that opens with a dose of frost and vinegar and turns believably sweet-and unbelievably marvelous, in light of what had seemed a depressing trajectory.	Handsomely photographed - then again, it's hard to make Paris ugly - Le Week-End is what Jesse and Celine may have to look forward to in 20 years.	Topped with bittersweet humor but possessing surprisingly thorny depths, Le Week-End offers a sophisticated, well-acted portrait of late-life struggles and long-term marriage.
It's this close to pure genius	While not for the faint of heart, Aqua Teen Hunger Force is perfectly suited for the seriously twisted followers--and new recruits--of the Cartoon Network show.	It's one thing to catch Aqua Teen in 15-minute increments on TV, but sitting through a feature-length onslaught is an endurance test even for devoted viewers.	I have never taken an illegal substance; movies have always been my drug of choice, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters was like a big old cinematic acid trip.	Except for an intriguing opening segment that pits a traditional bunch of movie snacks singing a suggestive jingle pitted against an aggressive punk counterpart, the movie is a bore.	The non sequitur humor of Aqua Teen Hunger Force will surely appeal to its built-in fanbase, but for the uninitiated, the premise wears thin.
Lord and Miller know how to play with their food -- they have a hunger for the whimsical detail	Overstuffed with enough sight gags to delight children while throwing in healthy dollops of wordplay and absurdist humor to keep their adult chaperones entertained as well.	A delicious farce and a backhanded slap at America the Obese, it may be the funniest animated film of the year.	When I dismiss many children's movies as being insipid and low-brow, I mean they actually insult their young audiences. Not this one.	Parental Content Review	Quirky humor, plucky characters and solid slapstick make this family comedy a frenetically tasty time at the movies.
Purely as an exercise in style, this movie has its moments.	It doesn't make an iota of sense.	Director Alexandre Aja, who wrote this with Gregory Levasseur, doesn't have a gift for horror suspense so much as a compleat geek knowledge of all the superior scare flicks that have preceded High Tension.	Aja creates a very effective slasher thriller only to light a match and send it up in flames with a third act twist that makes absolutely no sense	may start a bit shaky and feature an unfortunate-and homophobic-twist,but by its final gruesome and horrific scene it has wrapped itself firmly around the audience's senses	There is indeed a good amount of tension in this French slasher, but the dubbing is bad and the end twist unbelievable.
The movie makes a cleverish joke about the promise of porn, the promise that it tells the truth.	With its combination of heart and hilarity, bawdy blackouts and cleverly drawn characters, Smith starts out strong and ends up delivering something that's timeless as well as tasteless.	The mildly amusing scenario allows Smith ample opportunities for his slightly contrived yet often funny pushing-the-envelope-of-taste humour.	Some may tire of Smith's template of toilet humour and tits, but to others, those very same qualities are a guarantee of entertainment. Love him or hate him, Kevin Smith isn't afraid to hit new lows to get new laughs.	The laughs are plentiful, the obscene observations witty and well delivered, for two-thirds of the running time. It gets soggy when the relationship becomes the focus.	Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a modest success for Kevin Smith, due in large part to the charm of Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.
Individually, the stories are beautifully shot, intimately acted and usually engrossing.	Weaves its power through, instead of above us, in the effort of its own testament that the inner horrors of our time on Earth should be a uniter and not a divider, no matter who the decider might be.	Throughout the film the unpredictability, different and unique characters and the fast pace fuels the intrigue.	At the simplest level, the movie is several dramas told effectively, and processing the emotions in its most dramatic moments may be the best reward in watching it.	Satisfies as a story of people thousands of miles apart inextricably intertwined, with the snowball of fate already rolling down the hill.	In Babel, there are no villains, only victims of fate and circumstance. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iыarritu weaves four of their woeful stories into this mature and multidimensional film.
Hilarity ensues. Except when it doesn't, which is pretty much the entire movie.	What could have been a delicious hoot about dysfunctional dynamics in a disillusioned workplace merely ends up as a woeful, clunky comedy of errors.	Overall, the phrase 'It is what it is' has never seemed more appropriate.	A sloppily edited comedy laden with sub-amateurish acting, a script with less direction than a broken compass, and a sense of humor that never made it out of the junior high bathroom.	A sloppy, harebrained movie, which looks like it was made on a fraction of the budget of one of their videos.	Sloppily-made, amateurish, and scarce on laughs, The Wash can't compare to Richard Pryor's 1976 Car Wash.
The teen horror that was way before its time in the comedy parody stakes.	Fright Night is not a distinguished movie, but it has a lot of fun being undistinguished.	Scar-eeee!	Neatly parodying Hitchcock and John Hughes movies, writer/director Tom Holland litters his rattling story with as many laughs as jolts.	Fright Night dances on a tightwire between satire and terror, glittered by special effects and a with-it nonchalance.	Fright Night deftly combines thrills and humor in this ghostly tale about a man living next to a vampire.
Reminds us, sweetly, charmingly, and humorously, what Will Smith used to be like before he became an overnight action sensation.	Harmless fun for the dating crowd.	full review in Greek	Will Smith can play a matchmaker, too!	With it's share of Jerry Maguire moments mixed with real romance corn, Hitch is well worth the date.	Despite Hitch's predictability, Will Smith and Kevin James win praise for their solid, warmhearted performances.
It is not that the movie is particularly graphic, with very little blood actually being spilled on screen. Rather, it's a very disturbing film.	The most purely horrifying horror movie ever made.	One of the key films of modern horror.	The picture gets to you more through its intensity than its craft, but Hooper does have a talent.	Hooper's unrelenting assault on the senses is one of the most streamlined, sadistic horror movies ever made.	Thanks to a smart script and documentary-style camerawork, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre achieves start-to-finish suspense, making it a classic in low-budget exploitation cinema.
Disaster parody at its finest, 'Airplane!' is a hilarious comic treat.	Psycho ground controllers (Stack and Bridges), laff-a-second pace, and bludgeoning innuendo make this the acceptable face of the locker-room satire.	One of the finest American comedies ever made. Ever!	(No quote available.)	If Airplane! isn't the funniest English-language movie ever made, it could at least get into some spirited comedy fisticuffs	Though unabashedly juvenile and silly, Airplane! is nevertheless an uproarious spoof comedy full of quotable lines and slapstick gags that endure to this day.
Verges on the nasty for the nippers; sails close to déjŕ vu for fantasy fans; fated, probably, to damnation by faint praise.	A well intentioned fantasy with some wonderful special effects, Dragonslayer falls somewhat short on continuously intriguing adventure.	Let's face it -- nothing short of a gorilla suit can make Peter MacNicol not look like a weenie.	Dragonslayer transports us to a mysterious, exotic, and convincing ancient world.	So-so dragon story with an amusing Ralph Richardson performance.	An atypically dark Disney adventure, Dragonslayer puts a realistic spin -- and some impressive special effects -- on a familiar tale.
While Travolta is passable as Schlichtmann, it is the outstanding work from Duvall, Macy and briefly Tony Shalhoub that drive the story.	If you want to see a courtroom film with all the trimmings, this is the one.	Here is a film not interested in the surprise twists of other courtroom movies, but focuses on the strategy of the law.	I expected a harder hitting indictment against the uncaring power of corporate America. Instead, we get a middlin' courtroom drama that lacks the intensity of such films as the 1982 Sidney Lumet/Paul Newman film, The Verdict.	It's not bad, but with everything else out there, I won't recommend it.	Intelligent and unconventional.
Important, informative, imperfect.	There are few movies that can change the way you see the world in 83 minutes. If Blackfish is seen by enough people, it has the power to affect attendance at SeaWorld.	"Blackfish" is a disturbing movie, one that will make you rethink parks like SeaWorld and their value.	Damning and disturbing viewing.	It is never less than gripping, and devastatingly undermines the notion of performing whales as wholesome family entertainment.	Blackfish is an aggressive, impassioned documentary that will change the way you look at performance killer whales.
Even if the ending seems a bit tidy, the film is still effective and nicely creepy -- definitely worth seeing.	Kevin Bacon is remarkably effective as the caring father whose skepticism is rudely ruptured.	Many moments in the movie, creepy, funny, or just nifty, may manage a smirk of delight from you	It offers a stir of an echo of horror, rather than the genuine cathartic article.	Vibrant, unsettling.	Kevin Bacon's acting is so genuine that it's creepy and director David Keopp knows how to create true suspense.
This is the terminal illness weepie for people who don't watch terminal illness weepies, and it's much the better for it.	50/50 centers around a cancerous presence, and that refers to Seth Rogen as much as it does to the malignant tumor found on the spine of Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Carve Rogen out of the picture, and its chances of being a truly moving film increase.	Takes what I believe is one of the most realistic approaches to cancer and cancer treatment you'll see on screen, but remembers to treat its potentially delicate subject matter with a blunt sense of humor.	50/50 is a thoughtful and challenging story, grounded in real world characters, that also manages rewarding and cathartic laughs.	50/50 nimbly draws humor out of a young man's illness, walks a tightrope of tragicomedy and touches on all the right points.	A good-hearted film about a difficult topic, 50/50 maneuvers between jokes and drama with surprising finesse.
It's a remarkable documentary, thoroughly enjoyable and one of the most powerful films I've seen in quite some time.	As personally troublesome as they may be, the prickly dynamics keep the docu bobbing along.	Part history, part biography, part appreciation, and all therapy, it is a funny, wrenching, profound, and deeply moving film.	As fascinating as all the film history is, the movie's core is the dynamic between a famous but distant parent and his child.	A unique and luminous achievement.	The dysfunctional interaction between director and subject is fascinating, poignant, and revealing of both men and of father-son relationships in general.
Not one of the most successful of the "Star Trek" films, it's always nice to see the cast reunite.	There are other good reasons to see this particular film, including some sharply-staged action sequences and plenty of belly laughs.	The story has enough plot switchbacks, space battles and gizmo wizardry to ensure that most viewers won't forget the film until at least the next morning.	What starts out as a stroll through an idyllic Whole Earth Catalog-style communal existence resolves into a tightly knit sci-fi action adventure, packed with the verities that generations of Trekkies admire and expect.	The problem with Insurrection [isn't] that it's like a two-part episode. The problem is that it's like a one-part episode that was more than doubled in length without having nearly enough drama.	Although not terrible, the sluggishly paced Insurrection plays like an extended episode of the TV series.
Tenso e envolvente, embora substitua a complexidade psicológica e emocional do filme anterior por uma montagem mais preocupada com a história do que com os personagens.	... to finally watch the key scenes so vividly described by the author realized perfectly onscreen is worth admission alone (and even a few extra viewings besides).	Thankfully we have the increasingly interesting characters and their interactions to provide the bulk of the entertainment.	In the book this is a wholly engrossing story -- an epic tale of good and evil and loss and yearning. Transported to the screen, however, it has sustained a few dinks and dents.	Newell deftly avoids the mistake of making a kids' movie in which even the worst threat feels safe.	The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films.
Familiar youth crime/coming-of-age framework, novel setting and focus group.	For at least part of its length, "My Brother the Devil" brings refreshing changes to a genre badly in need of them.	El Hosaini's voice remains crisp, cool and consistently street-smart.	The attention El Hosaini gives to the physical structures in this neighbourhood is a poignant reminder of the lack of focus there generally is on the people who live inside them.	Sharply well-observed, this punchy British drama is packed with rising-star talent, including its gifted first-time writer-director, an engaging young cast and skilled cinematographer David Raedeker.	A tough, tender tale of familial angst with careful attention to detail, My Brother the Devil is a strong debut from director Sally El Hosaini.
A worthy, if dull addition to the studio's animated works.	As animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool, this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth.	I really wish I liked Spirit better.	It is perhaps Spirit's greatest achievement that the horses upstage the human actors, but it's also its greatest weakness. The human characters have no depth or personality, but are rather completely forgettable, stiff stereotypes.	As simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine. This is a movie you can trust.	A visually stunning film that may be too predictable and politically correct for adults, but should serve children well.
It programs its cheap laughs efficiently enough to make you think you're not really wasting your time.	Forget being up a raging creek without a paddle, these poor losers are lost in a wilderness that permits no comedy.	Some tales center on man vs. nature, others on man vs. man. Without a Paddle falls within a third category: man vs. poorly conceived script.	Even a paddle can't keep this movie from sinking.	At least Harold and Kumar were stoned (and funny). When characters are this stupid in a movie, they deserve to be eaten by a bear.	Without a Paddle has a few laughs, but not enough to sustain its running time.
A fun seaside frolic, but doesn't sit long in the mind.	Alfred Hitchcock's fluffy 1955 exercise in light comedy, minimal mystery, and good-natured eroticism (the fireworks scene is a classic).	Colorful, fun Hitchcock pairing Grant and Kelly.	Grant and Kelly are on sparkling form, as is Jessie Royce Landis as the latter's formidable and smirky mother, and the French Riviera is beautifully captured by the Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Burks.	Hitchock-lite, but highly enjoyable for it, To Catch a Thief is a visually dazzling romantic comedy with two incomparable leads.	It may occasionally be guilty of coasting on pure charm, but To Catch a Thief has it in spades -- as well as a pair of perfectly matched stars in Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
After 19 years, Spielberg and company have unearthed the best treasure of all - another great Indiana Jones movie.	I have to admit this is probably the smartest entry in the series.	The overall effect is either exhilarating or exhausting, depending on your emotional investment in the franchise, but credit where credit is due: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas set out to make one for the fans and delivered.	The pace is a bit lethargic, and the film also suffers from the usual Spielberg Achilles' heel of many, many false endings.	Karen Allen was once famous for drinking men under the table, and from the looks of her it's there they'll stay. As for Indy, now that he has reached the two-thirds century mark, it's time to stop using the whip and start using the term 'whippersnapper.'	Though the plot elements are certainly familiar, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull still delivers the thrills and Harrison Ford's return in the title role is more than welcome.
Akira Kurosawa's Samurai take on King Lear is brutal but brilliant, a startling transposition to match his earlier Macbeth adap Throne Of Blood.	...screen pictures of arresting beauty that keep the complex storyline hypnotically clear	Akira Kurosawa's 1985 film is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema.	A film of the sort of grandeur that brings to mind Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Napoleon Vu par Abel Gance and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.	Ran is a visually stunning epic, containing some of the most beautiful, colorful, breathtaking imagery ever committed to celluloid.	Akira Kurosawa's sprawling, epic take on King Lear should be required viewing for fans of westerns, war movies, or period films in general.
Details are beautifully observed in lengthy, theatrical scenes, which may not have been sustainable without a captivating performance from Luminita Gheorghiu.	It's through the dysfunctional mother-son relationship at its core that a pointed critique of the corruption bedevilling Romanian society emerges.	Netzer crafts not only a chilling story of family dysfunction, but also an illuminating look into the corruption and decay of the Romanian bourgeoisie - without ever overplaying his hand. It all appears so effortless, when in fact it's so skillful.	... both acerbic character study and understated indictment of Romania's justice system and entitled inner circle ... Like Angela Lansbury in 'Manchurian Candidate,' Gheorghiu's mother remains oblivious to the damage she has wrought.	The pacing is unyieldingly slow, while also missing that sense of creeping escalation that makes the better films of the Romanian art house moment so dreadfully effective	It isn't necessarily an easy watch, but thanks to Netzer's interesting direction and a riveting performance from Gheorghiu, Child's Pose is rewarding.
I can't help thinking that in this game of remake, points have been shaved.	Viewers who come to see a football movie likely will leave satisfied. But those who want to see an Adam Sandler movie would do better to rent The Waterboy.	Yeah, who needs talented actors like Burt Reynolds, Bill Fichtner, and James Cromwell when you can just hit someone in the crotch for 105 minutes?	The film primarily replaces its predecessor's gritty swagger with WWE and MTV-esque posturing.	There are occasional guffaws, but none of the jokes are more amusing (or farfetched) than the premise that Adam Sandler ever played in the National Football League.	This Yard has some laughs but missing from this remake is the edginess of the original.
Silver Linings Playbook is the best movie of 2012 and the acting is mind-boggling good. Give me the Oscar picks, and it wins in every nominated category.	A deliriously funny and disarmingly poignant love story that's sure to brighten the outlook of even the hardest cynic.	Silver Linings Playbook remains a very classy, acceptably funny slice of comic drama. But that eventual cop-out feels deeply unsatisfactory.	Cooper and Lawrence have a nice, believable chemistry, and by the time they get to the dance competition it's surprising how tense it is and much you are rooting for them.	It may be a Hollywood comedy, but it's one that feels beautifully alive.	Silver Linings Playbook walks a tricky thematic tightrope, but David O. Russell's sensitive direction and some sharp work from a talented cast gives it true balance.
Hudson soars (duh) on the vocal numbers, and Whitaker (double duh) is a tower of integrity and crushingly human. But "Black Nativity" isn't about stars, it's about unity, faith and family. As such it shines.	Jennifer Hudson sings like an angel but the movie is not up to that level storywise.	Corny, but well-acted -- with some players showing surprising singing chops -- and heartfelt.	Based on the play by poet/activist Hughes, this updated faith-based tale features rousing musical numbers and a well-meaning, if predictable, story, marked by unlikely coincidences.	This modest little feel-good movie won't contend for any major awards (unlike Whitaker's other movie this year, 'The Butler'), but its heart is in the right place.	It's sweetly amiable and solidly performed, but Black Nativity suffers from director Kasi Lemmons' heavy-handed treatment of its celebrated source material.
It breezes by and slaps you with some ice water and then scurries right out of the room.	A well made, if extremely hollow, technical exercise... so wafer-thin, I'm a little wary of calling it a movie. It's more like a photographed premise.	The final 20 minutes contain some of the best, uncontrived twists of any post-Sixth Sense American suspense film, but there is a good reason for that, as the co-directors reveal with a shocking epilogue.	That it is based on a true story does not compensate for the absence of either suspense or horror.	Definitely one of the best horror films I've seen in a while, and plays to the key of terror and our imagination provoking enough imagery without the director having to do much of anything...	Suspenseful and tense from start to finish, the French horror film Them proves that a lack of gore doesn't mean a dearth of scares.
Stick with it and you won't be sorry.	A very complex and engrossing mystery, filled with wonderful period details.	First-rate American pulp -- fast, absorbing and substantive.	Smooth and stylish mystery drama.	Monstrously funny and truly scary, Cheadle is handed a scene-stealing role and never hesitates to do it justice.	Humor, interesting characters, and attention to details make the stylish Devil in a Blue Dress an above average noir.
Richard LaGravenese's film succeeds primarily because, like the classic Stand and Deliver, it's about abandoned kids learning to be the best they can possibly be.	In the hands of writer-director Richard LaGravenese, Freedom Writers turns out to be a superb piece of mainstream entertainment.	At once heartfelt, absorbing, and dopey.	At first glance, it looks like it might be just another one of those films in which a white idealist liberates her non-white pupils, but thankfully, it's better than that.	Annoying subplots and paper-thin villains ensure that the movie remains mired in mediocrity.	Freedom Writers is a frank, formulaic entry in the inspirational inner-city teacher genre, with an energetic Hilary Swank leading the appealing cast of unknowns.
The kind of quietly unassuming tear-jerker that works its way into your heart despite the occasional cries of protest emanating from your head.	We always understand why these people feel the way they do and, remarkably, believe we well might act the same were we in their shoes.	This compelling Italian drama will have you weeping before the credits roll.	Tough and sensible film, whose heart is in the right place.	Tackles issues like guilt, shame and compassion with admirable sensitivity.	Favoring subtlety over cheap sentimentality, The Keys to the House is emotionally honest, compassionate, and a genuine tear-jerker.
Note well that Ella is enchanted, not enchanting...any charm it might have possessed is buried under reams of cuteness and silly anachronism.	Ella would be a lot more enchanting if it weren't such a pandering piece of product.	It's a high-spirited charmer, a fantasy that sparkles with delights.	Looks an awful lot like "Shrek," down to the funky closing dance sequence.	Veers wildly from juvenile comedy to romance to morality lesson, never quite finds its footing.	Hathaway is a charming heroine, but the simple storyline gets overwhelmed by silly gimmickry.
Sure, the end is a foregone conclusion (it's in the history books, kids), but the unfolding events are a class-A story of survival, and will keep even the most well-informed viewers glued to their seats.	... a good choice for a family movie outing.	Those who see Endurance, however, are not likely soon to forget what they see, even if they have some difficulty imagining how it could be possibly be true.	Even knowing the happy outcome, Butler masterfully keeps us on the edge of our seats.	An engrossing documentary.	The Endurance presents exciting footage of an amazing real-life story of survival.
This has the feel of something genuine: sweet, touching, and sentimental.	A great movie to watch with the family at Christmas.	Leave your preconceptions about fishing at the door: you'll be caught hook, line and sinker.	A truly remarkable film. Redford's direction is unmatching.	A specialist in bringing books to life as movies, Redford has a knack for finding what matters in the text and making sure it ends up on screen.	Tasteful to a fault, this period drama combines a talented cast (including a young Brad Pitt) with some stately, beautifully filmed work from director Robert Redford.
One of the best of the end-of-the-eighties/start-of-the-nineties body mortification films.	At its heart, Candyman terrifies because of its ideas. It sinks its horrific foundations very much in the real world of poverty and racial alienation.	Serious, straightforward cinematic terror is always hard to come by, but this literate shocker ranks among the best horror movies of the '90s.	Candyman is atmospheric and visually stimulating enough to satisfy gore-hounds as well as being an intelligent social commentary.	Truly Scary. You'll never utter this title's name when alone again.	Though it ultimately sacrifices some mystery in the name of gory thrills, Candyman is a nuanced, effectively chilling tale that benefits from an interesting premise and some fine performances.
A clever, classy and affecting thriller that never goes off the rails.	Confounding, exhilarating, challenging--and the best movie I've seen so far in 2011.	A thriller that takes a science fiction premise and uses it, not for the sake of splashy effects, but as a doorway into the human soul.	Ultimately, Source Code makes good on its Hitchcockian opening sequence -- it may pale in comparison to the master, but it's a fun, puzzle-filled ride, with excellent pacing and a mounting uneasiness that recalls the best episodes of The Twilight Zone.	It's an action film concerned with speaking and thinking, rather than shouting and exploding; each time the bomb goes off, it becomes less exciting, less of a focal point, until the most striking pyrotechnics on show are of the mental and emotional sort.	Finding the human story amidst the action, director Duncan Jones and charming Jake Gyllenhaal craft a smart, satisfying sci-fi thriller.
It's trying to be funny and it's trying to be cool but Killers doesn't quite get there.	Perhaps some future social scientist will explain why the traditional romantic comedy transformed during the first decade of the 21st century into the screwball action-comedy, in which bonds of love are strengthened by gunplay, car chases and explosions.	The murderously boring Killers firmly belongs in the dregs of the ever increasing number of rom-com-action movies.	A fluffy but harmless action comedy.	A lazy script makes for a cheesy and predictable film that features two crummy performances from stars who are hard to dislike.	Dull, formulaic, and chemistry-free, Killers is an action/comedy that's largely bereft of thrills or laughs.
A mixed bag of style and ethics fluidly formed into an entertaining and thought-provoking whole.	full review in Greek	The shifting dynamics in the group keep the story interesting.	The degree to which one sympathizes with the movie's protagonists may depend upon the age of the viewer	Ambitious but ultimately lackluster drama about the conflict between extremist politics and selfish human nature.	The Edukators engagingly plays out the clash between youthful idealism and older pragmaticism.
Allows cross-cultural conversations about love, relationships, and marriage to convey the beauty school's potential for cultivating hope in a more progressive future.	Any film that raises this many interesting questions is worth seeing, though Beauty Academy never goes quite deep enough to become essential.	Yes, (Mid)west is (Mid)west and (Mid)east is (Mid)east, but the twain do meet -- sort of -- in this fascinating, unassuming little film.	a spiny, puzzling and highly entertaining film, and whatever you go into it thinking, you're likely to come out thinking something else.	This movie shows us a small bit of daily life as lived by real people. For that alone, we should be grateful.	There's nothing frivolous about beauty school when hearing about the individual lives of these women in Afghanistan, and the contrast between them and the idealistic beauticians from America.
It's pretty watchable, mainly thanks to strong performances from Kinnear and Coleman. Cyrus, sadly, fails to convey a broken heart.	Anything more labored than stolen kisses, paternal resentment, and gorgeous beachside cinematography grinds the whole endeavor to a disappointing halt.	The Last Song ultimately proves to be a far more engaging piece of work than the viewer might've initially suspected.	Parental Content Review	An obvious bid for the teen queen to extend beyond her comfort zone only to then clearly show her limits and need for further development.	As shamelessly manipulative as any Nicholas Sparks production, The Last Song is done no favors by its miscast and overmatched star, Miley Cyrus.
The film has no qualities beyond its formal polish.	Finds itself current again as a metaphor for a great industrial country led blindly into a prolonged war to no good, understandable end but for the dealing of death in an alien place.	Das Boot (The Boat) is a claustrophobic, tense, and dramatically gripping film about life aboard a German U-boat in World War 11.	Gripping and authentic.	Petersen's shooting style displays a breathtaking, if impersonal and faintly academic, virtuosity comparable to that of Lean or Coppola.	Taut, breathtakingly thrilling, and devastatingly intelligent, Das Boot is one of the greatest war films ever made.
[An] enjoyable animated feature from Disney Studios.	A dull and disjointed retelling that spends more time on the buffoonish antics of Prince John and Sir Hiss than on the outlaw archer.	No one makes cultural appropriation as much fun as Walt Disney.	Not one of Disney's better animated efforts; it lacks the majesty of earlier works.	...owes much of its charm to its precise anthropomorphization.	One of the weaker Disney adaptations, Robin Hood is cute and colorful but lacks the majesty and excitement of the studio's earlier efforts.
An unusually unpleasant and unwatchable sci-fi endeavor...	There are some well-executed sequences, but the story makes nothing but a mess of its borrowed ideas.	[Pandorum] makes no sense. It doesn't really try to by the end but nevertheless, it should be said up front so that nobody has any illusions about the film since its creators certainly didn't.	It couldn't keep my attention for even a nano second.	Not without its scuzzy charms and eye-catching creature attacks, "Pandorum" generates all the stylish muster it can. Still, it feels like a Christopher Lambert film that would have gone straight to VHS about 15 years ago.	While it might prove somewhat satisfying for devout sci-fi fans, Pandorum's bloated, derivative plot ultimately leaves it drifting in space.
An enlightening look back at how "the world's sport" briefly took off in the US.	With just a little tweaking ... could be reworked in a Christopher Guest-style mockumentary of swollen egos and corporate whimsy.	Full of drama and fascinating anecdotes.	... treats its audience like a bunch of attention deficit disorder cases.	mostly I'm stricken with nostalgia for '70s fashion and Marv Albert's hairdo	You don't have to be a soccer fan to enjoy this stylish, breezy slice of 1970s sports history.
Proceed with caution.	As 1979's The Motion Picture courted derision for its cerebral 2001 approach, The Final Frontier damages it's own cause with a high-brow 'Man's Search for God' story.	It's amazing an entire studio would bend over to make William Shatner's ego trip.	...delivers all the pleasure of a plucked pubic hair.	Easily the weakest of the original cast Star Trek films.	Filled with dull action sequences and an underdeveloped storyline, this fifth Trek movie is probably the worst of the series.
Reality of story combines with reality of performance to give us some of the most heartfelt emotions currently on the big screen.	Good Will Hunting is stuffed -- indeed, overstuffed -- with heart, soul, audacity, and blarney. You may not believe a minute of it, but you don't necessarily want to stop watching.	Although celebrating the redemptive power of love, loyalty, sacrifice, and genius, it roots its feel-good message in performances, dialogue, and a locale as pungently authentic as the smell of corned beef and cabbage.	[A] very good film.	É realmente impressionante que dois jovens como Matt Damon e Ben Affleck tenham sido capazes de escrever um roteiro tăo complexo quanto o de 'Gęnio Indomável'.	It follows a predictable narrative arc, but Good Will Hunting adds enough quirks to the journey -- and is loaded with enough powerful performances -- that it remains an entertaining, emotionally rich drama.
Bryan Singer's poker face is worthless at best.	Too predictable. Still enthralling enough to watch (at least twice).	There are plenty of twists in the plot to keep you on your toes throughout the film.	Singer, like Tarantino, is less into mining new film themes than in re-inventing old ones. And the way he does so shows full well that there is still a bit of life in the old mob movie yet.	It may ultimately make sense; no one could tell without at least four or five viewings. What is totally commanding, however, is the level of ensemble acting [and] the adroitness of the storytelling.	Expertly shot and edited, The Usual Suspects gives the audience a simple plot and then piles on layers of deceit, twists, and violence before pulling out the rug from underneath.
With Sandler as his simpering straight man, Nicholson makes faces shamelessly, rude noises shamefully, but he can't make Anger Management funny.	One of [Adam] Sandler's weaker, more slapdash efforts.	There are some good jokes that are well suited for each individual actor, but when brought together their brands of humor clash.	There are plenty of laughs and solid surprises in Anger Management, as well as the sheer pleasure of watching Jack Nicholson untethered.	Director Peter Seagal has shown talent for comedy previously (1995's Tommy Boy), but here, his timing is a bit off and the film is paced pretty badly.	Thought not without its funny moments, Anger Management is ultimately stale and disappointingly one-note, especially considering its capable cast.
The cinematography, the interviews, the endurance, the enthusiasm seen in this film are wonderfully entertaining.	The race becomes a metaphor for life, in which finishing builds camaraderie and victory is not the ultimate goal.	It's an adrenaline rush of a film, the closest anyone not inside a power-engine dune buggy will get to the love-hate experience of the unpredictable course.	If you're not already hooked on the spectacle of folks driving fast through the desert, this film won't necessarily sell you.	Aside from the lessened condescension in Brown's voice-over narration, he's still capable of envisioning a feature-length, theatrical-release doc as nothing more (or less) than a segment of ABC's Wide World of Sports writ large.	Amazing footage from the Baja off-road race will give viewers an adrenaline rush.
The final 40-plus minutes are bananas.	Mr. Miike has done such a remarkable job with the overall saga and the characters that one can't help but become emotionally invested.	13 Assassins looks at honour from many angles, without becoming simplistic. Ichii hasn't lost his edge after all.	No one who has seen Seven Samurai will be surprised by the trajectory and outcome of Takashi Miike's 13 Assassins, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't plenty of surprises and enormous thrills to be found within	Phenomenally entertaining. A ripping old-school yarn.	Takashi Miike's electric remake of Eiichi Kudo's 1963 period action film is a wild spectacle executed with killer, dizzying panache.
No matter who's talking, the audience's attention will be on the images wrapping themselves around them.	Deep Sea doesn't take any chances, doesn't tell you anything you don't know and doesn't do anything to allay my fear that IMAX movies are running out of stories to tell.	IMAX movies, especially in 3-D, are well suited to take you to another world... and what a world it is.	Deep Sea easily ends up one of the best times I've ever had inside an Imax theater.	Take the plunge. This is one instance where it's totally delightful to feel like you're swimming with sharks.	Viewers will welcome being whisked away to this magical world of exotic sea life.
More humorous than funny, more charming than truly entertaining.	A caper film whose biggest thief is actually the inexorable flow of time..a terrific character study..the always-captivating Frank Langella gets to stretch out a little bit.	"Robot & Frank" hits all the right notes - romantic, fantastic, tragic and sweet.	A work of power, nuance and daredevil craft, Langella's performance is a reminder that giants still fill the stage, and the screen.	It may not seem like an even playing field pitting an actor as powerfully intense as Frank Langella opposite a robot, but that's the game plan behind the waywardly endearing, slightly futuristic fantasy Robot & Frank.	Led by a brilliant performance from star Frank Langella, Robot & Frank works as both a quirky indie drama and as a smart, thoughtful meditation on aging.
As inept as his direction is, Solomon's script is worse, an awful screenplay that shamelessly swipes some of its characters and scenes from the Star Wars movies without as much as a simple acknowledgment.	Dungeons & Dragons takes itself far too seriously and ends up being just plain stupid.	Where is the bubonic plague when you need it? I wanted them all to die and the sooner, the better.	All the dungeon masters, warriors and illusionists out there who have devoted countless late-night hours to D&D have a right to feel disrespected, if not insulted.	Gamer geeks, I speak your language! And I warn you: Flee!	Critics say this movie has a cheap look and is badly directed. Despite the presence of talented actors, the performances are really bad, and additionally, some people are offended at Marlon Wayans' character, calling it a racist throwback to black stereotypes.
In this job, I witness so much soulless Hollywood drivel that I stand prepared to cheer any literate, solidly acted, character-driven film. Then I see something like Pay It Forward and I change my mind.	Keeps zigging and zagging between plots and subplots that don't really matter.	It's carried to an amazing degree by its performances.	You witness the first, testing, tension-packed conversation between Spacey and Osment, as pregnant in its silences as in its words, and you are ready to go wherever this movie leads you.	even if you don't buy the idea... it's still quite possible to enjoy the movie as a love story involving two badly damaged souls.	Pay It Forward has strong performances from Spacey, Hunt, and Osment, but the movie itself is too emotionally manipulative and the ending is bad.
Valli never lets the immense rawness of the film oppress the grace found in its gripping character-driven firmament.	That these Tibetans can be so relaxed and natural in front of a camera, playing versions of themselves but not themselves, speaks well of the whole culture.	Valli documents the tremendous beauty of this remote region and of its inhabitants in one of the year's better films.	The film utilizes nonactors across the board, and they go about their business with the sort of confidence and ease that can only come after a lifetime in this terrain.	A truly magnificent and authentic Nepalese film...	Unlike the overproduced and overbudgeted Hollywood blockbusters, Himalaya is a stunningly photographed movie that offers an intimate look into the lives of a Dolpo tribe.
With an astute and very funny script, this quirky comedy is packed with entertaining characters and situations that continually catch the audience by surprise...	In its a-linear presentation of the story of Maxine and Shirin's relationship, the film takes after Annie Hall, though we spend a fair portion of the film observing Shirin in the aftermath of that relationship's demise.	It is admittedly another entry into the hip New York twenty-something subgenre. It is also, however, a frank and very funny debut from an interesting new talent.	The female-fronted confessional comedy is given a Middle Eastern twist in writer/director Desiree Akhavan's sharply penned feature debut, in which she also stars.	...Appropriate Behavior depicts a woman striving to be a quirky indie protagonist and gradually realizing that she's actually a human being.	Warm, funny, and quietly profound, Appropriate Behavior serves as a thoroughly compelling calling card for writer, director, and star Desiree Akhavan.
Matrixian, Orwellian, and boneheadian.	Bale makes it all frighteningly real. And lots of fun.	... Equilibrium is one of the better action/sci-fi movies of the year ...	Apesar de obviamente inspirado em Matrix (para nгo citar 1984 e Fahrenheit 451, entre outros), o filme convence graзas ao interessante dilema emocional de seu protagonista e аs intensas coreografias das seqькncias de aзгo.	The dumbest view of the future I've seen (and, reader, I survived John Travolta in Battlefield Earth).	Equilibrium is a reheated mishmash of other sci-fi movies.
It makes the Great Recession intelligible with sass and graphic verve.	Another fine example of Ferguson's ability to tackle a topic in a way that keeps you riveted to every single word, knowing full well how much better you'll be by knowing what you'll learn by paying attention.	By turns riveting, rage-inducing and utterly depressing, this is a well made, superbly written documentary that demands to be seen and thoroughly deserves its Oscar nomination.	Inside Job is as much crisp, professional journalism as ballsy takedown, and the film's two sides complement rather than detract from each other.	Inside Job is essential and empowering viewing about institutionalised corporate greed	Disheartening but essential viewing, Charles Ferguson's documentary explores the 2008 Global Financial Crisis with exemplary rigor.
Josh Peck and Ben Kingsley make for an oddly engaging couple in Jonathan Levine's audacious comedy about sex, drugs, and unexpected friendships.	The Wackness is a moderately funny variant of the traditional coming-of-age saga. But it never creates characters likeable enough to care for.	It was applauded at Sundance, where coming-of-age movies are inevitably hailed, but its grungy angst offers nothing we need to see anew.	It's an old theme. Levine tackles it with gusto and verve, and if ultimately he overdoes it with a hi-end quirky style, I think there's enough authenticity here to see the film through.	Most of the time, Peck is cast adrift in an uncertain world, and Levine too often conflates his lack of purpose with the movie's.	Sympathetic characters and a clever script help The Wackness overcome a familiar plot to make for a charming coming-of-age comedy.
A gentle, bittersweet love story boasting a picturesque, enchanting travelogue of Cairo and a radiant, well-nuanced and engrossing performance by the genuinely beautiful Patricia Clarkson.	A subtle, quiet, slow film that succeeds in not only burrowing under your skin and into your mind during its running time but has a remarkable ability to stay there for days and weeks afterward.	The lovely twilit moments in this movie stay with one, and that summoning them up in your mind is like slowing down time.	With echoes of the classic Roman Holiday, Cairo Time is a must see for armchair travelers and lovers of romantic dramas alike.	Compared to other platonic film romances, this one comes up lacking, even with the note-perfect performances from Clarkson and Siddig.	Though potentially too slowly paced for some, Cairo Time lingers long after the closing credits, largely due to a wonderful performance by Patricia Clarkson.
Irreverent and satirical with cocksure brilliant Kevin Spacey adroitly handling the constantly shifting, darkly absurdist allegiances.	Mr. Hickenlooper's oddly apolitical caper film loses itself in the puzzle of its protagonist's personality.	Great fun and strong filmmaking, encapsulating the hubris and self-aggrandizement that marked the career of uber-lobbyist Jack Abramoff.	Kevin Spacey gives such a cynical and calculated perfromance as Jack Abramoff that he makes the man less interesting than he must have been. For better account, watch Gibney's docu about the same subject, "Casino Jack and the United States of Money."	Tonally scattershot and more than a little heavy-footed. But then, so were the real cons from which Abramoff profited while the flimflam worked.	Kevin Spacey turns in one of his stronger performances, but Casino Jack is a disappointingly uneven fictionalized account of a fascinating true story.
A wickedly funny political satire, that, while consistently tickling your funny bone, rings astoundingly true.	Wicked, poisonous fun.	Entertaining, creepily resonant political comedy.	It's half a brilliant political satire, half a wacky outrageous comedy of errors. The first half works, the second half doesn't.	A dazzling, thought-provoking entertainment which alternately tickles you and slaps you in the face.	Smart, well-acted, and uncomfortably prescient political satire from director Barry Levinson and and all-star cast.
There's ... plenty here to enjoy.	Maybe the film's ambiguity is its message all along--that life is what you make of it.	Richly enjoyable Robert Altman. Not for kids.	There is never anything in the film to make you want to keep watching it. Not one thing about it is compelling or engaging.	Dr. T isn't a dreadful movie, but its spontaneity does feel forced, and we glean very little that is satisfying from the example of Dr. T's confusion.	In terms of quality, Dr. T and the Women is one of Altman's good-but-not-great films. In typical Altman style, it features some great ensemble acting, including a wonderful performance by Richard Gere.
Such a marvellous film. So wonderfully performed.	No-wonder Jack was so keen to land this role. It was simply perfect for him.	A cut above the typical chick flick, thanks to its heartfelt performances and genuine frankness.	Brooks' dialog is wonderful throughout and all the characters carry off their assignments beautifully, even down to Danny De Vito and Norman Bennett as MacLaine's other suffering suitors.	The most remarkable achievement of Terms of Endearment, which is filled with great achievements, is its ability to find the balance between the funny and the sad, between moments of deep truth and other moments of high ridiculousness.	A classic tearjerker, Terms of Endearment isn't shy about reaching for the heartstrings -- but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it's almost impossible to resist.
Even with Paul Green's invective echoing in the back of your mind, nothing's quite so heartwarming as the sight of a young person blossoming.	The real Paul Green is even funnier and more entertaining than Jack Black's fictionalized version of him	It's unflinching, discomfiting, profane, with an ignoble real-life 'hero' and children who absorb the full brunt of his rage.	Green is not an angry jerk so much as a guy playing an angry jerk because he loves rock music and wants these kids to play it well.	Director Don Argott works with muddy, low-quality digital video, not compellingly edited, and doesn't dig as deep as he should.	Boasting an entertaining and eccentric cast of characters, Rock School lives up to its name.
It's not a good sign when, at the end of an alien invasion movie, you're disappointed that the aliens have not emerged victorious.	Battle takes its fight so seriously that it's hard to get behind the mission.	Battle: Los Angeles draws entirely on clichés ... And they're all shouted at top volume.	This silly extraterrestrial-invasion epic somehow manages the feat of making the destruction of La La Land seem tedious.	A sturdy alien-invasion flick that focuses almost exclusively on the military response.	Overlong and overly burdened with war movie clichés, Battle: Los Angeles will entertain only the most ardent action junkies.
Viscerally exciting, but without a brain in its head...like an outstanding ten-minute audition reel repeated nine times.	Bang! An instant cult hit...	This swift, rank, enjoyably dark movie presses against so many limits, it achieves the threshold of a new limit.	Good taste is the first fatality in this gonzo thrill-seeker, sure to offend mainstream dispositions, yet too stylistically audacious to dismiss outright.	The movie I've been waiting for my whole life. Michael Davis is my soul mate.	As preposterous and over-the-top as Shoot 'Em Up may be, its humor and non-stop action make for a very enjoyable film.
Ultimately it's a film that understands that it's OK to insert a little T&A into the political discourse.	While the film is of a serious nature, it plays as a comedy and turns out to be well-crafted entertainment.	If we learned anything from The Da Vinci Code, it is how you should never under estimate Tom Hanks with a goofy hair cut.	Tells a momentous story -- a story every American should know -- in a boisterous, lickety-split style that makes the history lesson go down easily.	as good as this movie is, I get the sense that Charlie Wilson himself has some better stories to tell.	Charlie Wilson's War manages to entertain and inform audiences, thanks to its witty script and talented cast of power players.
From the nondescript voices to routine animation to an over-written story, this movie spends much of its time gasping for air.	...surprise, Surf's Up turns out to be a small winner, a cute animal animation that works its surfer world with offbeat humor.	It's harmless fun and a welcome alternative to Shrek the Third.	Cartoonishly surging with liquid color, digital waves and jokes that even include gefilte fish, Surf's Up never forgets to have fun.	Takes a swell idea and then wastes it on a forgettable plot and one-dimensional characters.	Surf's Up is a laid back, visually stunning animated movie that brings a fresh twist to some familiar conventions. Its witty mockumentary format is fun and inventive, and the CGI is breathtakingly realistic.
Here's yet another excellent argument for the legalization of marijuana... it will prevent us seeing more movies like this one...	...a hit of "Pineapple Express" is just the cure for the dog days of summer.	...an above-average contemporary "stoner" comedy.	What keeps the film so engagingly off-balance is the mix of perfectly pitched stoner humor and the visceral punch of the genre mixing...	Sidesplitting, high attrition-rate, S&M slapstick where you get to savor the sight of characters getting tortured to death about five times each, if that's your bag of grass.	Both funny and scatter shot, this loose-knit action/buddy/stoner comedy bridges genres and keeps a steady tempo of low ball laughs.
